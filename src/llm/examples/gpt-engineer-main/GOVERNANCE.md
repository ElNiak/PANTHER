# Governance Model of GPT-Engineer

## I. Project Board Structure

### Project Board

The Project Board is the central decision-making body for the project, overseeing both strategic and technical decisions of the open source project GPT-Engineer.

#### Composition:
- The Board consists of the project's founder, Anton Osika, and representatives from each significant contributing entity, including individual contributors and commercial partners.
- The board is restricted to a maximum of 7 seats.
- New board members are admitted by majority vote.
- Board members may be expelled by majority vote.

## II. Roles and Responsibilities

### Veto due to Ethical Considerations
- The founder has veto right over any decisions made by the Board.
- This veto power is a safeguard to ensure the project's direction remains true to its original vision and ethos.

### Contribution-Conditioned Decision Making
- Each board member has one vote as long as they qualify as active contributors.
- To qualify as an active contributor, a board member or the entity they represent, must have made 6 significant contributions on the GPT-Engineer GitHub page over the past 90 days.
- A significant contribution is:
  - A merged pull request with at least 3 lines of code.
  - Engagement in a GitHub/Discord bug report, where the board members' input leads to the confirmed resolution of the bug. If the solution is in terms of a merged pull request, the bug resolution together with the merged pull request counts as one significant contribution.
  - A non-code, but necessary, community activity agreed on by the board, such as administration, corporate design, workflow design etc, deemed to take more than 1 hour. Participation in meetings or discussions does not count as a significant contribution.
- A board member may retain its seat on the board without voting right.

## III. Decision-Making Process

### Majority Voting
- Decisions are made based on a simple majority vote. Majority means more than half of board members with voting rights agree on one decision, regardless of the number of choices.
- The founder's veto can override the majority decision if exercised.

### Regular Meetings and Reporting
- The Board will convene regularly, with the frequency of meetings decided by the Board members.
- Decisions, discussion points, and contributions will be transparently documented and shared within the project community.

## IV. Data Access and Confidentiality

### Board Members' Right to Access Data
- Any confidential data collected by GPT-Engineer is accessible to the board members after signing a relevant non-disclosure agreement (NDA).
- A relevant NDA requires a board member to erase any copies of confidential data obtained by the time of leaving the board.

## V. Scope of Voting

### Essential Topics
- Board voting is restricted to essential topics.
- Essential topics include essential technical topics and essential community topics.
- An essential technical topic is a change in the GPT-engineer code base that is likely to introduce breaking changes, or significantly change the user experience for users and developers.
- Essential community topics are changes to the community's governance or other central policy documents such as the readme or license.
- Day-to-day tasks such as bug fixes or implementation of new features outside the core module do not require voting.

## VI. Transparency

### Commitment to Transparency
- The governance process will be transparent, with key decisions, meeting minutes, and voting results publicly available, except for sensitive or confidential matters.

## VII. Amendments

### Changes to Governance Structure
- The governance model can be revised as the project evolves. Proposals for changes can be made by any Board member and will require a majority vote for adoption.

## VIII. The GPT-Engineer Brand

### Copyright and Stewardship
- The creator of GPT-engineer (Anton Osika) will be the steward of the GPT-engineer brand to decide when and how it can be used, and is committed to never jeopardizing the interest of the open source community in this stewardship.
- Anton Osika possesses the exclusive intellectual property rights for the trademark 'GPT-engineer,' encompassing all case variations such as 'gpt-engineer,' 'GPT-engineer,' and 'GPTE.' This ownership extends to the exclusive legal authority to utilize the 'GPT-engineer' trademark in the establishment and branding of both commercial and non-profit entities.
