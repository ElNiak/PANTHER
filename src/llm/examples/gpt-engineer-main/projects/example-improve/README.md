To implement the game Snake in Python using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, we will need several classes and files. The game will be controlled using the keyboard.

Here are the core classes and their purposes:

1. `Game`: This is the main class that will control the game flow. It will be responsible for starting the game, handling user input, and updating the game state.

2. `Snake`: This class will represent the snake in the game. It will have methods to move the snake, grow the snake, and check if the snake has collided with itself.

3. `Food`: This class will represent the food in the game. It will have methods to place the food at a random location on the game board.

4. `Board`: This class will represent the game board. It will have methods to draw the board, the snake, and the food.

5. `Controller`: This class will handle user input. It will have methods to listen for keyboard events and update the direction of the snake accordingly.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`, and then go to the ones that are imported by that file.
