These AI personas respond to queries with characteristic flairâ€”Gates humorously deflecting a proposition to buy Twitter, and Musk articulating his vision for the platform's future. These interactions are not just simulations but showcase AI's growing capacity to reflect complex public personas for both entertainment and educational experiences. This feature exemplifies the blend of AI sophistication and human-like interaction, all within a user-friendly chat interface complete with necessary disclaimers for clarity.

        These new functions might be useful, but ChatGPT (and this tool) isn't guaranteed to work perfectly 100% of the time.

        - Warning: the environment times out after 10 minutes of inactivity
        - If environment times out, you'll lose your files, so download them whenever you can.
        - You can use `/memory` to save files and memory.
        - If a file is _saved_ in the sandbox, that's it. Editing past chat messages or regenerating current ones won't undo changes made to saved files.
        - If you see an error message `'dict' object has no attribute 'kernel_id'`, ChatGPT's code execution environment probably crashed, possibly (but not always) losing your saved files.
        - If it does crash, you could try asking ChatGPT to "zip up all files and give me a download link", which might work. Sometimes.
