# Layer 2: Transport layer protocols

## QUIC
`QUIC` is a new transport layer protocol that was developed by Google and is now being standardized in the IETF. It is a protocol that is built on top of UDP and is designed to address the shortcomings of TCP. It is a protocol that is designed to be secure, multiplexed, and performant. It is also designed to be extensible and to be able to evolve over time.
First formal specification project using Ivy and NCT is Ivy. Most complete project.

## UDP
`UDP` is a simple transport layer protocol that is built on top of IP. It is a protocol that is designed to be simple and lightweight. It is a protocol that is designed to be unreliable and connectionless. It is a protocol that is designed to be fast and efficient. It is a protocol that is designed to be used for applications that do not require reliability or ordering of packets.
Simple interface, but not very flexible. No way to extend it. Allow to send UDP packet through Ivy models.
Not a formal specification project but can be used in Ivy models.

## TCP
`TCP` is a transport layer protocol that is built on top of IP. It is a protocol that is designed to be reliable and connection-oriented. It is a protocol that is designed to be used for applications that require reliability and ordering of packets. It is a protocol that is designed to be used for applications that require a connection to be established before data can be sent.
Simple interface, but not very flexible. No way to extend it. Allow to send TCP packet through Ivy models.
Not a formal specification project but can be used in Ivy models.
