# Layer 7: Fake protocols
## MiniP

MiniP (Minimalist Protocol) is a simple protocol. MiniP defines packets that
contain frames. Three types of frames are defined: PING, PONG, and TIMESTAMP
frames. PING frame contains a 4-byte string representing the word "ping". PONG
frame also contains a four-byte string expressing the term "pong". The PING
frame or the PONG frame must be present in a packet. Finally, the TIMESTAMP
frame contains an 8-byte unsigned integer representing the moment, in milliseconds, when the packet is sent. This frame must be present in all packets.
The client starts by sending a packet containing the PING frame followed by the TIMESTAMP
frame as payload. The server must then respond within 3 seconds, with a packet
containing the PONG frame followed by the TIMESTAMP frame. This exchange continues until the client stops the connection. The client terminates the connection
by not transmitting any packets for more than 3 seconds
