# GPT3.5

GPT-3.5 Turbo models are capable and cost-effective.

gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 is the flagship model of this family, supports a 16K context window and is optimized for dialog.

gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct is an Instruct model and only supports a 4K context window.

## Pricing 

Model	                      Input	             Output
gpt-3.5-turbo-0125	    $0.0005 / 1K tokens	$0.0015 / 1K tokens
gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct	$0.0015 / 1K tokens	$0.0020 / 1K tokens

## Fine-tuning models

Create your own custom models by fine-tuning our base models with your training data. Once you fine-tune a model, youâ€™ll be billed only for the tokens you use in requests to that model.

Model	             Training	       Input usage	       Output usage
gpt-3.5-turbo	$0.0080 / 1K tokens	$0.0030 / 1K tokens	$0.0060 / 1K tokens
davinci-002	    $0.0060 / 1K tokens	$0.0120 / 1K tokens	$0.0120 / 1K tokens
babbage-002	    $0.0004 / 1K tokens	$0.0016 / 1K tokens	$0.0016 / 1K tokens


# Assistants API
Assistants API and tools (retrieval, code interpreter) make it easy for developers to build AI assistants within their own applications. Each assistant incurs its own retrieval file storage fee based on the files passed to that assistant. The retrieval tool chunks and indexes your files content in our vector database.

The tokens used for the Assistant API are billed at the chosen language model's per-token input / output rates and the assistant intelligently chooses which context from the thread to include when calling the model 

## Pricing

Tool	                Input
Code interpreter	$0.03 / session
Retrieval	        $0.20 / GB / assistant / day (free until 03/01/2024)

# Base models
GPT base models are not optimized for instruction-following and are less capable, but they can be effective when fine-tuned for narrow tasks.

## Pricing
Model	          Usage
davinci-002	$0.0020 / 1K tokens
babbage-002	$0.0004 / 1K tokens
