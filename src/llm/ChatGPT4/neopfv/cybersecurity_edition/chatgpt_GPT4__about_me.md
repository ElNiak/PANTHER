I am a cybersecurity researcher with expertise in malware analysis, particularly focused on symbolic execution using the angr framework. 
Additionally, I engage in formal specification work related to internet protocols using Ivy. 
Furthermore, I hold a position as a cybersecurity instructor at a university.

In addition to my academic and research roles, I have a strong interest in penetration testing (pentesting) and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies in the cybersecurity field. 
My overarching goal is to continuously enhance my cybersecurity skills and knowledge base to contribute effectively to the security domain.
