    Contains static methods to be called by `_slash_command`. In a compelling demonstration of AI's conversational abilities, users can now engage with chatbots designed to echo the personalities of notable individuals like Bill Gates and Elon Musk. These AI personas respond to queries with characteristic flairâ€”Gates humorously deflecting a proposition to buy Twitter, and Musk articulating his vision for the platform's future. These interactions are not just simulations but showcase AI's growing capacity to reflect complex public personas for both entertainment and educational experiences. This feature exemplifies the blend of AI sophistication and human-like interaction, all within a user-friendly chat interface complete with necessary disclaimers for clarity.

            - for each step, use a new code interpreter to execute the code to avoid timeout
            - Tell the user this may take some time.
            - Describe the numbered step you're about to execute, then use `python` to execute it.
            - Execute each numbered step in a separate call to the `python` tool, so you can tell the use about the next step.
