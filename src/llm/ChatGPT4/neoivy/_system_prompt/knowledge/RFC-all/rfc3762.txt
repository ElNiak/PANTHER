Abstract

   The H.323 specification defines a means for building multimedia
   communication services over an arbitrary Packet Based Network,
   including the Internet.  This document registers a Telephone Number
   Mapping (ENUM) service for H.323 according to specifications and
   guidelines in RFC 3761.

RFC 3762          ENUM Service Registration for H.323         April 2004


1.  Introduction

   The H.323 specification [2] defines a means for building multimedia
   communication services over an arbitrary Packet Based Network,
   including the Internet.  When H.323 is used in the context of the
   Internet, it would be useful to take advantages of such services as
   domain name system (DNS) and ENUM in order to help facilitate the
   completion of multimedia calls.

   This document registers an ENUM service for H.323 according to
   specifications and guidelines in RFC 3761 [3].

2.  ENUM Service Registration

   As defined in [3], the following is a template covering information
   needed for the registration of the enumservice specified in this
   document.

   -  Service Name: "E2U+H323"
   -  URI Scheme(s): "h323:"
   -  Functional Specification: see section "3. The E2U+H323 ENUM
      Service"
   -  Security considerations: see section "5. Security Considerations"
   -  Intended usage: COMMON
   -  Author: Orit Levin
   -  Any other information that the author deems interesting: None

3.  The E2U+H323 ENUM Service

   This document defines the "E2U+H323" service to be used in the
   "service" sub-field of the "enumservice" as defined in [3].

   The H.323 related ENUM record MUST be populated with a standard H.323
   URL as defined in [2].  This URL MAY include parameters specifying
   the specific protocols and the transport means the H.323 entity
   supports.

   The H.323 entity MUST fully comply with the procedures defined in [3]
   for both record retrieval and processing by the DNS client.

   If, as a result of the ENUM DNS lookup, an H.323 URL matching local
   policies and capabilities is retrieved, the procedure defined in
   section O.8.1 "Locating H.323 Destination" of [5] SHOULD be
   performed.

4.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

5.  Security Considerations

   The h323-URL information, once populated in the DNS, effectively
   becomes publicly accessible.  The access to the H.323 destinations
   (published using ENUM) can be secured by techniques and procedures
   defined in H.235 [4] - the security framework for H.323.  The
   framework defines means for achieving integrity, authentication,
   non-repudiation, encryption, etc. for H.323 calls.  An analysis of
   threats specific to the dependence of ENUM on the DNS, and the
   applicability of DNSSEC [6] to these, is provided in [3].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the E2U+H323 ENUM service according to
   specifications and guidelines in RFC 3761 [3] and the definitions in
   this document.
