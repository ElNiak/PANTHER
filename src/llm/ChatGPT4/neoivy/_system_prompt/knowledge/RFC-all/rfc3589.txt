Abstract

   This document describes the IANA's allocation of a block of Diameter
   Command Codes for the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)
   Release 5.  This document does not pass judgment on the usage of
   these command codes.  Further more, these command codes are for use
   for Release 5.  For future releases, these codes cannot be reused,
   but must be allocated according to the Diameter Base specification.

RFC 3589       Diameter Command Codes for 3GPP Release 5 September 2003


1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the
   Internet Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as part of their Release 5
   architecture.  As part of this architecture, they have defined a
   Diameter application [29.229] and [29.329] which requires the use of
   new Diameter Command Codes [DIAM].

2.  Command Code Allocation

   The IANA has allocated Diameter Command Codes 300 through 313, for
   use in 3GPP Release 5.  The protocols defined by these command codes
   have not been carefully reviewed by the IETF community and are not
   considered to be general mechanisms appropriate for broad usage.
   More work is needed to develop general mechanisms and may become a
   work item of an IETF Working Group.  These command codes are intended
   to be used for 3GPP Release 5 only [29.228], [29.229].  Future 3GPP
   releases are expected to make use of alternate mechanisms.

   Command codes for 3GPP Release 6 are expected to be allocated from
   the standard command space, with IETF documentation.  The current
   intent as agreed with 3GPP is to develop a standards track
   application addressing the needs of AAA for SIP/SDP and encompassing
   the requirements of the cellular community.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is not known to affect the security of the Internet.
