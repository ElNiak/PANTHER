       Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespaces for Broadband Forum

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifiers (NIDs) "bbf",
   "broadband-forum-org", and "dslforum-org" for Uniform Resource Names
   (URNs) used to identify resources published by Broadband Forum (BBF).
   BBF specifies and manages resources that utilize these three URN
   identification models.  Management activities for these and other
   resource types are handled by BBF.

1.  Introduction

   Broadband Forum (BBF) is a non-profit industry alliance driving
   broadband wireline solutions and empowering converged packet networks
   worldwide to better meet the needs of vendors, service providers, and
   their customers.  BBF develops multi-service broadband packet
   networking specifications that address interoperability,
   architecture, and management.  Its work enables home, business, and
   converged broadband services, encompassing customer, access, and
   backbone networks.

   Occasionally, BBF specification efforts require identifiers in a
   managed namespace so that they are unique and persistent.  To ensure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of three specific

RFC 8057           URN Namespaces for Broadband Forum       January 2017


   Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC2141] Namespace Identifiers (NIDs)
   for use by BBF are being specified in this document, in full
   conformance with the NID registration process specified in [RFC3406].

   The "bbf" NID is for new work efforts related to data models for
   protocols other than the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) WAN
   Management Protocol (CWMP) [TR-069].  The "broadband-forum-org" and
   "dslforum-org" NIDs are used for all data models related to CWMP
   [TR-069].  BBF has used the latter two NIDs for many years without
   formally registering them and has published widely implemented
   specifications that use these NIDs.  Use of the "dslforum-org" NID
   started prior the organization's 2008 name change from DSL Forum to
   Broadband Forum.

      registration date: 2016-12-05

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Address: 5177 Brandin Court, Fremont, CA 94538, USA

RFC 8057           URN Namespaces for Broadband Forum       January 2017


   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The syntax of namespace-specific strings for the "bbf" namespace
      is <NSS> in [RFC2141].

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      BBF publishes information regarding the registered resources on
      the BBF Assigned Resources web page [BBF-RESOURCES].

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      BBF will manage resource classes using the "bbf" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  BBF is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the
      strings themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility for
      certain defined resources.

      BBF may, at the namespace resource manager's discretion,
      designate/allocate experimental type values for testing purposes
      only.  Note that using experimental types may create collisions,
      as multiple users may use the same values for resources and
      specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      BBF will update the BBF Assigned Resources web page
      [BBF-RESOURCES] to document the registered resources that use the
      "bbf" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      BBF procedures for URN assignment are provided at [BBF-RESOURCES].

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with a resolution discovery system;
      this is not applicable for this URN registration.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      implemented in support of BBF activities.

   Scope:

5.  Examples

   The following examples represent hypothetical URNs that could be
   assigned by BBF.

   urn:broadband-forum-org:cwmp:datamodel-1-5

   urn:bbf:yang:fast

   The first of these defines an URN to be used for CPE WAN Management
   Protocol (CWMP) data models conforming to rules for BBF's CWMP suite
   of specifications.

RFC 8057           URN Namespaces for Broadband Forum       January 2017


6.  Namespace Considerations

   BBF develops various specifications that require the use of data
   models.  URN namespaces are key constructs to manage the definitions
   of those data models reliably with persistence and uniqueness.

   The use of URNs should also help specification authors to maintain
   different versions of URNs and dependencies between URNs, across
   different versions of BBF specifications, if they so wish.

   Three NIDs are defined.  The "broadband-forum-org" and "dslforum-org"
   NIDs have been used for many years by BBF without formal
   registration.  (Broadband Forum changed its name from DSL Forum in
   2008.)  As they are referenced by multiple BBF specifications
   currently in common use, BBF is formalizing them.  The new "bbf" NID
   will be used for new work efforts that are not enhancements, updates,
   or extensions to work that currently makes use of the "broadband-
   forum-org" and "dslforum-org" NIDs.

7.  Community Considerations

   Participants involved in the development and usage of Broadband Forum
   specifications will benefit from the publication of this namespace by
   providing consistent and reliable names for the XML namespaces,
   schema locations, and similar identifiers of physical data models
   published within BBF specifications.

   The BBF specifications are publicly available and are licensed to
   manufacturers on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.  BBF will
   maintain the allocation of resources for the "bbf", "broadband-forum-
   org", and "dslforum-org" NIDs at the following publicly viewable
   location: [BBF-RESOURCES].  BBF will also maintain the corresponding
   specifications where the registered resources are referenced or used.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds three new entries in the formal urn-namespaces
   registry.  The namespaces are "bbf", "broadband-forum-org", and
   "dslforum-org".  This is the defining document.  The entries can be
   found at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces> and any
   associated mirrors.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.
