              URN for Country-Specific Emergency Services

Abstract

   This document updates the registration guidance provided in Section
   4.2 of RFC 5031, which allows the registration of service URNs with
   the 'sos' service type only for emergency services "that are offered
   widely and in different countries".  This document updates those
   instructions to allow such registrations when, at the time of
   registration, those services are offered in only one country.

1.  Introduction

   The advice to experts for registering sub-services of the service URN
   with the 'sos' service type is provided in Section 4.2 of RFC 5031
   [RFC5031] as follows:

      The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
      immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
      government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services
      can be added after expert review and must be of general public
      interest and have a similar emergency nature.  The expert is
      designated by the ECRIT working group, its successor, or, in their
      absence, the IESG.  The expert review should only approve
      emergency services that are offered widely and in different
      countries, with approximately the same caller expectation in terms
      of services rendered.  The 'sos' service is not meant to invoke
      general government, public information, counseling, or social
      services.

   Some existing emergency services are, at least initially, offered in
   only one country.  Examples are the "Reporting spies" emergency
   service offered in South Korea and the "GAULA (anti-kidnapping)"
   emergency service offered in Colombia according to [WIKIPEDIA].
   Future emergency service might also initially be introduced in only
   one country.

   The advice to experts of sub-services of the service URN with the
   'sos' service type provided in RFC 5031 [RFC5031] prevents the
   registration of a sub-service of the service URN with the 'sos'
   service type for a service that, at the time of registration, is
   offered in one country only.

RFC 7163           Country-Specific Emergency Services        March 2014


   This document updates the 2nd paragraph of Section 4.2 of RFC 5031
   [RFC5031], in order to allow the registration of service URNs with
   the 'sos' service type for emergency services that, at the time of
   registration, are offered in one country only.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

3.  Update to RFC 5031

3.1.  General

   Section 3.2 of this document replaces the text of the 2nd paragraph
   of Section 4.2 (Sub-Services for the 'sos' Service) of RFC 5031
   [RFC5031].

3.2.  New Text Replacing the Text of the 2nd Paragraph of Section 4.2 of
      RFC 5031

   The 'sos' service type describes emergency services requiring an
   immediate response, typically offered by various branches of the
   government or other public institutions.  Additional sub-services can
   be added after expert review.  The expert is designated by the ECRIT
   working group, its successor, or, in their absence, the IESG.  The
   designated expert should only approve services that are to be used
   for emergency purposes, that are offered in at least one country,
   that do not match the description of any existing service URN with
   the 'sos' service type, and where the service description and the URN
   are defined as broadly as possible to encourage reuse.  The 'sos'
   service is not meant to invoke general government, public
   information, counseling, or social services.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the advice to the expert of the "'sos' Sub-
   Services" registry.  IANA has updated the reference for that registry
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-serviceid-labels> to point to
   this document (instead of RFC 5031 [RFC5031]).

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not update the Security Considerations of RFC
   5031.
