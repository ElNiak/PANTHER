    Revision to Registration Procedures for Multiple BMP Registries

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 7854, "BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)", by
   changing the registration procedures for several registries.
   Specifically, any BMP registry with a range of 32768-65530 designated
   "Specification Required" has that range redesignated as "First Come
   First Served".

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7854] creates a number of IANA registries that include a range of
   32768-65530 designated "Specification Required".  Each such registry
   also has a large range designated "Standards Action".  Subsequent
   experience has shown two things.  First, there is less difference
   between these two policies in practice than there is in theory
   (consider that [RFC8126] explains that for Specification Required,
   "Publication of an RFC is an ideal means of achieving this
   requirement").  Second, it's desirable to have a very low bar to
   registration, to avoid the risk of conflicts introduced by use of
   unregistered code points (so-called "code point squatting").

   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures, as
   given in Section 2.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has revised the following registries within the BMP group:

   *  BMP Statistics Types
   *  BMP Initiation and Peer Up Information TLVs
   *  BMP Termination Message TLVs
   *  BMP Termination Message Reason Codes
   *  BMP Route Mirroring TLVs
   *  BMP Route Mirroring Information Codes

   For each of these registries, the ranges 32768-65530 whose
   registration procedures were "Specification Required" are revised to
   have the registration procedures "First Come First Served".

3.  Security Considerations

   This revision to registration procedures does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in [RFC7854].
