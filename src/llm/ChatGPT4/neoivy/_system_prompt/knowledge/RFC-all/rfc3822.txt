Abstract

   This document defines the use of Service Location Protocol version 2
   (SLPv2) by Fibre Channel over TCP/IP (FCIP) Entities.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Service Location Protocol
   version 2 in performing dynamic discovery of participating Fibre
   Channel over TCP/IP (FCIP) Entities.  Implementation guidelines,
   service type templates, and security considerations are specified.

2.  Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   Here are some definitions that may aid readers that are unfamiliar
   with either SLP or FCIP.  Some of these definitions have been
   reproduced from [RFC2608] and [RFC3105].

   User Agent (UA)            A process working on the client's behalf
                              to establish contact with some service.
                              The UA retrieves service information from
                              the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

   Service Agent (SA)         A process working on behalf of one or more
                              services to advertise the services and
                              their capabilities.

   Directory Agent (DA)       A process which collects service
                              advertisements.  There can only be one DA
                              present per given host.

   Scope                      A named set of services, typically making
                              up a logical administrative group.

   Service Advertisement      A URL, attributes, and a lifetime
                              (indicating how long the advertisement is
                              valid), providing service access
                              information and capabilities description
                              for a particular service.

   FCIP Entity                The principle FCIP interface point to the
                              IP network.

   FCIP Entity Name           The world wide name of the switch if the
                              FCIP Entity resides in a switch or the
                              world wide node name of the associated
                              Nx_Port.

   FCIP Discovery Domain      The FCIP Discovery Domain specifies which
                              FCIP Entities are allowed to discover each
                              other within the bounds of the scope.

4.  Using SLPv2 for FCIP Service Discovery

   At least two FCIP Entities must be involved in the entity discovery
   process.  The end result is that an FCIP Entity will discover one or
   more peer FCIP Entities.

4.1.  Discovering FCIP Entities using SLPv2

   Figure 1 shows the relationship between FCIP Entities and their
   associated SLPv2 agents.

   Figure 1: FCIP Entity and SLPv2 Agent Relationship.

   As indicated in Figure 1, each FCIP Entity contains an FCIP Control
   and Services Module that interfaces to an SLPv2 SA and UA.

   The SA constructs a service advertisement of the type
   "service:fcip:entity" for each of the service URLs it wishes to
   register.  The service advertisement contains a lifetime, along with
   other attributes defined in the service template.

   The remainder of the discovery process is identical to that used by
   any client/server pair implementing SLPv2:

   1. If an SLPv2 DA is found [RFC2608], the SA contacts the DA and
      registers the service advertisement.  Whether or not one or more
      SLPv2 DAs are discovered, the SA maintains the service
      advertisement itself and answers multicast UA queries directly.

RFC 3822           Finding FCIP Entities Using SLPv2           July 2004


   2. When the FCIP Entity requires contact information for a peer FCIP
      Entity, the UA either contacts the DA using unicast or the SA
      using multicast using an SLPv2 service request.  The UA service
      request includes a query, based on the attributes, to indicate the
      characteristics of the peer FCIP Entities it requires.

   3. Once the UA has the IP address and port number of a peer FCIP
      Entity, it may begin the normal connection procedure, as described
      in [RFC3821], to a peer FCIP Entity.

   The use of a DA is RECOMMENDED for SLPv2 operations in an FCIP
   environment.

4.1.1.  FCIP Discovery Domains

   The concept of a discovery domain provides further granularity of
   control of allowed discovery between FCIP Entities within a specific
   SLPv2 scope.

   Figure 2 shows an example relationship between FCIP Entities and
   their associated discovery domains within a specified SLPv2 scope.

   Within the specified scope "fcip", the administrator has defined a
   discovery domain "purple", allowing FCIP Entities A, B, and C to
   discover each other.  This discovery domain is illustrated using the
   "*" character.

   Within the specified scope "fcip", the administrator has defined a
   discovery domain "orange", allowing FCIP Entity A to discover FCIP
   Entity B, but not FCIP Entity  C.  This discovery domain is
   illustrated using the "#" character.

   Within the specified scope "fcip", the administrator has defined a
   discovery domain "blue", allowing FCIP Entity C to discover FCIP
   Entity B, but not FCIP Entity A.  This discovery domain is
   illustrated using the "/" character.

   For the example relationship shown in Figure 2, the value of the
   fcip-discovery-domain attribute for each FCIP Entity is as follows:

   FCIP Entity A = orange,purple

   FCIP Entity B = orange,blue,purple

   FCIP Entity C = blue,purple

5.  FCIP SLPv2 Templates

   Two templates are provided: an FCIP Entity template, and an abstract
   template to provide a means of adding other FCIP related templates in
   the future.

5.1.  The FCIP Abstract Service Type Template

   This template defines the abstract service "service:fcip".  It is
   used as a top-level service to encapsulate all other FCIP related
   services.

   Language of service template: en

5.2.  The FCIP Entity Concrete Service Type Template

   This template defines the service "service:fcip:entity".  A device
   containing FCIP Entities that wishes to have them discovered via
   SLPv2 would register each of them with each of their addresses, as
   this service type.

   FCIP Entities wishing to discover other FCIP Entities in this manner
   will generally use one of the following example query strings:

   1. Find a specific FCIP Entity, given its FCIP Entity Name:

      Service:  service:fcip:entity
      Scope:    fcip-entity-scope-list
      Query:    (fcip-entity-name=\ff\10\00\00\60\69\20\34\0C)

   2. Find all of the FCIP Entities within a specified FCIP Discovery
      Domain:

      Service:  service:fcip:entity
      Scope:    fcip-entity-scope-list
      Query:    (fcip-discovery-domain=fcip-discovery-domain-name)

   3. In addition, a management application may wish to discover all
      FCIP Entities:

      Service:  service:fcip:entity
      Scope:    management-service-scope-list
      Query:    none

     - the FCIP Discovery Domain Name for which addresses are requested
     - the service URL

6.  Security Considerations

   The SLPv2 security model as specified in [RFC2608] does not provide
   confidentiality, but does provide an authentication mechanism for UAs
   to assure that service advertisements only come from trusted SAs with
   the exception that it does not provide a mechanism for authenticating
   "zero-result responses".  See [RFC3723] for a discussion of the SLPv2
   [RFC2608] security model.

   Once an FCIP Entity is discovered, authentication and authorization
   are handled by the FCIP protocol.  It is the responsibility of the
   providers of these services to ensure that an inappropriately
   advertised or discovered service does not compromise their security.

   When no security is used for SLPv2, there is a risk of distribution
   of false discovery information.  The primary countermeasure for this
   risk is authentication.  When this risk is a significant concern,
   IPsec SAs SHOULD be used for FCIP traffic subject to this risk to
   ensure that FCIP traffic only flows between endpoints that have
   participated in IKE authentication.  For example, if an attacker
   distributes discovery information falsely claiming that it is an FCIP
   endpoint, it will lack the secret information necessary to
   successfully complete IKE authentication, and hence will be prevented
   from falsely sending or receiving FCIP traffic.

   There remains a risk of a denial of service attack based on repeated
   use of false discovery information that will cause the initiation of
   IKE negotiation.  The countermeasures for this are administrative
   configuration of each FCIP Entity to limit the peers that it is
   willing to communicate with (i.e., by IP address range and/or DNS
   domain), and maintenance of a negative authentication cache to avoid
   repeatedly contacting an FCIP Entity that fails to authenticate.
   These three measures (i.e., IP address range limits, DNS domain
   limits, negative authentication cache) MUST be implemented.

6.1.  Security Implementation

   Security for SLPv2 in an IP storage environment is specified in
   [RFC3723].  IPsec is mandatory-to-implement for IPS clients and
   servers.  Thus, all IP storage clients, including those invoking SLP,
   can be assumed to support IPsec.  SLP servers, however, cannot be
   assumed to implement IPsec, since there is no such requirement in
   standard SLP.  In particular, SLP Directory Agents (DA) may be
   running on machines other than those running the IPS protocols.

   IPsec SHOULD be implemented for SLPv2 as specified in [RFC3723]; this
   includes ESP with a non-null transform to provide both authentication
   and confidentiality.

   Because the IP storage services have their own authentication
   capabilities when located, SLPv2 authentication is OPTIONAL to
   implement and use (as discussed in more detail in [RFC3723]).

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes two SLP Templates in Section 5.  They should
   be registered in the IANA "SVRLOC Templates" registry.  This process
   is described in the IANA Considerations section of [RFC2609].

8.  Internationalization Considerations

   SLP allows internationalized strings to be registered and retrieved.
   Attributes in the template that are not marked with an 'L' (literal)
   will be registered in a localized manner.  An "en" (English)
   localization MUST be registered, and others MAY be registered.

9.  Summary

   This document describes how SLPv2 can be used by FCIP Entities to
   find other FCIP Entities.  Service type templates for FCIP Entities
   are presented.
