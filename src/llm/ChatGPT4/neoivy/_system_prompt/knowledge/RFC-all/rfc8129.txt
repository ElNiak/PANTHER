              Authentication Indicator in Kerberos Tickets

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 4120, as it specifies an extension in the
   Kerberos protocol.  It defines a new authorization data type,
   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR.  The purpose of introducing this data
   type is to include an indicator of the strength of a client's
   authentication in service tickets so that application services can
   use it as an input into policy decisions.

1.  Introduction

   Kerberos [RFC4120] allows secure interaction among users and services
   over a network.  It supports a variety of authentication mechanisms
   using its pre-authentication framework [RFC6113].  The Kerberos
   authentication service has been architected to support password-based
   authentication as well as multi-factor authentication using one-time
   password devices, public-key cryptography, and other
   pre-authentication schemes.  Implementations that offer
   pre-authentication mechanisms supporting significantly different
   strengths of client authentication may choose to keep track of the
   strength of the authentication that was used, for use as an input
   into policy decisions.

   This document specifies a new authorization data type to convey
   authentication strength information to application services.
   Elements of this type appear within an AD-CAMMAC (Authorization Data
   type Container Authenticated by Multiple Message Authentication
   Codes) [RFC7751] container.

2.  Document Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  AD Type Specification

   The Key Distribution Center (KDC) MAY include authorization data of
   ad-type 97, wrapped in AD-CAMMAC, in initial credentials.  The KDC
   MAY copy it from a ticket-granting ticket into service tickets.

RFC 8129                Authentication Indicator              March 2017


   The corresponding ad-data field contains the DER encoding [X.690] of
   the following ASN.1 [X.680] type:

   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR ::= SEQUENCE OF UTF8String

   Each UTF8String value is a short string that indicates that a
   particular set of requirements was met during the initial
   authentication.  These strings are intended to be compared against
   known values.  They are not intended to store structured data.  Each
   string MUST be either:

   o  A URI that references a Level of Assurance Profile [RFC6711], or

   o  A site-defined string, which MUST NOT contain a colon, whose
      meaning is determined by the realm administrator.

   Authorization data elements of type AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MUST
   be included in an AD-CAMMAC container so that their contents can be
   verified as originating from the KDC.  Elements of type
   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MAY safely be ignored by applications and
   KDCs that do not implement this element.

4.  Assigned Numbers

   RFC 4120 [RFC4120] is updated in the following way:

   o  The ad-type number 97 is assigned for AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR,
      updating the table in Section 7.5.4 of RFC 4120 [RFC4120].

   o  The table in Section 5.2.6 of RFC 4120 [RFC4120] is updated to map
      the ad-type 97 to "DER encoding of AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR".

5.  Security Considerations

   Elements of type AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR are wrapped in AD-CAMMAC
   containers.  AD-CAMMAC supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED and allows both
   application services and the KDC to verify the authenticity of the
   contained authorization data.

   KDC implementations MUST use AD-CAMMAC verifiers as described in the
   security considerations of RFC 7751 [RFC7751] to ensure that
   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements are not modified by an attacker.
   Application servers MUST validate the AD-CAMMAC container before
   making authorization decisions based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR
   elements.  Application servers MUST NOT make authorization decisions
   based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements that appear outside of
   AD-CAMMAC containers.

RFC 8129                Authentication Indicator              March 2017


   Using multiple strings in AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR may lead to
   ambiguity when a service tries to make a decision based on the
   AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR values.  This ambiguity can be avoided if
   indicator values are always used as a positive indication of certain
   requirements being met during the initial authentication.  For
   example, if a "without-password" indicator is inserted whenever
   authentication occurs without a password, a service might assume this
   is an indication that a higher-strength client authentication
   occurred.  However, this indicator might also be inserted when no
   authentication occurred at all (such as anonymous PKINIT).

   Application service evaluation of site-defined indicators MUST
   consider the realm of original authentication in order to avoid
   cross-realm indicator collisions.  Failure to enforce this property
   can result in invalid authorization decisions.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.
