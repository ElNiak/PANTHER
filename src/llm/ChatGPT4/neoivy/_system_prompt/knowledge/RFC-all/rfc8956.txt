           Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules for IPv6

Abstract

   "Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules" (RFC 8955) provides a
   Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) extension for the propagation of
   traffic flow information for the purpose of rate limiting or
   filtering IPv4 protocol data packets.

   This document extends RFC 8955 with IPv6 functionality.  It also
   updates RFC 8955 by changing the IANA Flow Spec Component Types
   registry.

1.  Introduction

   The growing amount of IPv6 traffic in private and public networks
   requires the extension of tools used in IPv4-only networks to also
   support IPv6 data packets.

   This document analyzes the differences between describing IPv6
   [RFC8200] flows and those of IPv4 packets.  It specifies new Border
   Gateway Protocol [RFC4271] encoding formats to enable "Dissemination
   of Flow Specification Rules" [RFC8955] for IPv6.

   This specification is an extension of the base established in
   [RFC8955].  It only defines the delta changes required to support
   IPv6, while all other definitions and operation mechanisms of
   "Dissemination of Flow Specification Rules" will remain in the main
   specification and will not be repeated here.

1.1.  Definitions of Terms Used in This Memo

   AFI:      Address Family Identifier

   AS:       Autonomous System

   NLRI:     Network Layer Reachability Information

   SAFI:     Subsequent Address Family Identifier

   VRF:      Virtual Routing and Forwarding

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IPv6 Flow Specification Encoding in BGP

   [RFC8955] defines SAFIs 133 (Dissemination of Flow Specification
   rules) and 134 (L3VPN Dissemination of Flow Specification rules) in
   order to carry the corresponding Flow Specification.

   Implementations wishing to exchange IPv6 Flow Specifications MUST use
   BGP's Capability Advertisement facility to exchange the Multiprotocol
   Extension Capability Code (Code 1), as defined in [RFC4760].  The
   (AFI, SAFI) pair carried in the Multiprotocol Extension Capability
   MUST be (AFI=2, SAFI=133) for IPv6 Flow Specification rules and
   (AFI=2, SAFI=134) for L3VPN Dissemination of Flow Specification
   rules.

3.  IPv6 Flow Specification Components

   The encoding of each of the components begins with a Type field (1
   octet) followed by a variable length parameter.  The following
   sections define component types and parameter encodings for IPv6.

   Types 4 (Port), 5 (Destination Port), 6 (Source Port), 9 (TCP Flags),
   10 (Packet Length), and 11 (DSCP), as defined in [RFC8955], also
   apply to IPv6.  Note that IANA has updated the "Flow Spec Component
   Types" registry in order to contain both IPv4 and IPv6 Flow
   Specification component type numbers in a single registry
   (Section 8).

3.1.  Type 1 - Destination IPv6 Prefix

   Encoding:  <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), offset (1 octet),
      pattern (variable), padding (variable) >

   This defines the destination prefix to match.  The offset has been
   defined to allow for flexible matching to portions of an IPv6 address
   where one is required to skip over the first N bits of the address.
   (These bits skipped are often indicated as "don't care" bits.)  This
   can be especially useful where part of the IPv6 address consists of
   an embedded IPv4 address, and matching needs to happen only on the
   embedded IPv4 address.  The encoded pattern contains enough octets
   for the bits used in matching (length minus offset bits).

   length:    This indicates the N-th most significant bit in the
              address where bitwise pattern matching stops.

   offset:    This indicates the number of most significant address bits
              to skip before bitwise pattern matching starts.

   pattern:   This contains the matching pattern.  The length of the
              pattern is defined by the number of bits needed for
              pattern matching (length minus offset).

   padding:   This contains the minimum number of bits required to pad
              the component to an octet boundary.  Padding bits MUST be
              0 on encoding and MUST be ignored on decoding.

   If length = 0 and offset = 0, this component matches every address;
   otherwise, length MUST be in the range offset < length < 129 or the
   component is malformed.

   Note: This Flow Specification component can be represented by the
   notation ipv6address/length if offset is 0 or ipv6address/offset-
   length.  The ipv6address in this notation is the textual IPv6
   representation of the pattern shifted to the right by the number of
   offset bits.  See also Section 3.8.

3.2.  Type 2 - Source IPv6 Prefix

   Encoding:  <type (1 octet), length (1 octet), offset (1 octet),
      pattern (variable), padding (variable) >

   This defines the source prefix to match.  The length, offset,
   pattern, and padding are the same as in Section 3.1.

3.3.  Type 3 - Upper-Layer Protocol

   Encoding:  <type (1 octet), [numeric_op, value]+>

   This contains a list of {numeric_op, value} pairs that are used to
   match the first Next Header value octet in IPv6 packets that is not
   an extension header and thus indicates that the next item in the
   packet is the corresponding upper-layer header (see Section 4 of
   [RFC8200]).

   This component uses the Numeric Operator (numeric_op) described in
   Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC8955].  Type 3 component values SHOULD be
   encoded as a single octet (numeric_op len=00).

   Note: While IPv6 allows for more than one Next Header field in the
   packet, the main goal of the Type 3 Flow Specification component is
   to match on the first upper-layer IP protocol value.  Therefore, the
   definition is limited to match only on this specific Next Header
   field in the packet.

3.4.  Type 7 - ICMPv6 Type

   Encoding:  <type (1 octet), [numeric_op, value]+>

   This defines a list of {numeric_op, value} pairs used to match the
   Type field of an ICMPv6 packet (see also Section 2.1 of [RFC4443]).

   This component uses the Numeric Operator (numeric_op) described in
   Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC8955].  Type 7 component values SHOULD be
   encoded as a single octet (numeric_op len=00).

   In case of the presence of the ICMPv6 type component, only ICMPv6
   packets can match the entire Flow Specification.  The ICMPv6 type
   component, if present, never matches when the packet's upper-layer IP
   protocol value is not 58 (ICMPv6), if the packet is fragmented and
   this is not the first fragment, or if the system is unable to locate
   the transport header.  Different implementations may or may not be
   able to decode the transport header.

3.5.  Type 8 - ICMPv6 Code

   Encoding:  <type (1 octet), [numeric_op, value]+>

   This defines a list of {numeric_op, value} pairs used to match the
   code field of an ICMPv6 packet (see also Section 2.1 of [RFC4443]).

   This component uses the Numeric Operator (numeric_op) described in
   Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC8955].  Type 8 component values SHOULD be
   encoded as a single octet (numeric_op len=00).

   In case of the presence of the ICMPv6 code component, only ICMPv6
   packets can match the entire Flow Specification.  The ICMPv6 code
   component, if present, never matches when the packet's upper-layer IP
   protocol value is not 58 (ICMPv6), if the packet is fragmented and
   this is not the first fragment, or if the system is unable to locate
   the transport header.  Different implementations may or may not be
   able to decode the transport header.

3.6.  Type 12 - Fragment

   Encoding:  <type (1 octet), [bitmask_op, bitmask]+>

   This defines a list of {bitmask_op, bitmask} pairs used to match
   specific IP fragments.

   This component uses the Bitmask Operator (bitmask_op) described in
   Section 4.2.1.2 of [RFC8955].  The Type 12 component bitmask MUST be
   encoded as a single octet bitmask (bitmask_op len=00).

                      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                    | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |LF |FF |IsF| 0 |
                    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                     Figure 1: Fragment Bitmask Operand

   Bitmask values:

   IsF:  Is a fragment other than the first -- match if IPv6 Fragment
         Header (Section 4.5 of [RFC8200]) Fragment Offset is not 0

   FF:   First fragment -- match if IPv6 Fragment Header (Section 4.5 of
         [RFC8200]) Fragment Offset is 0 AND M flag is 1

   LF:   Last fragment -- match if IPv6 Fragment Header (Section 4.5 of
         [RFC8200]) Fragment Offset is not 0 AND M flag is 0

   0:    MUST be set to 0 on NLRI encoding and MUST be ignored during
         decoding

3.7.  Type 13 - Flow Label (new)

   Encoding:  <type (1 octet), [numeric_op, value]+>

   This contains a list of {numeric_op, value} pairs that are used to
   match the 20-bit Flow Label IPv6 header field (Section 3 of
   [RFC8200]).

   This component uses the Numeric Operator (numeric_op) described in
   Section 4.2.1.1 of [RFC8955].  Type 13 component values SHOULD be
   encoded as 4-octet quantities (numeric_op len=10).

3.8.  Encoding Examples

3.8.1.  Example 1

   The following example demonstrates the prefix encoding for packets
   from ::1234:5678:9a00:0/64-104 to 2001:db8::/32 and upper-layer
   protocol tcp.

                           Table 2

   This constitutes an NLRI with an NLRI length of 18 octets.

   Padding is not needed either for the destination prefix pattern
   (length - offset = 32 bits) or for the source prefix pattern (length
   - offset = 40 bits), as both patterns end on an octet boundary.

3.8.2.  Example 2

   packets from ::1234:5678:9a00:0/65-104 to 2001:db8::/32.

   +-------+-------------+---------------------------------+

                            Table 4

   This constitutes an NLRI with an NLRI length of 15 octets.

   The source prefix pattern is 104 - 65 = 39 bits in length.  After the
   pattern, one bit of padding needs to be added so that the component
   ends on an octet boundary.  However, only the first 39 bits are
   actually used for bitwise pattern matching, starting with a 65-bit
   offset from the topmost bit of the address.

4.  Ordering of Flow Specifications

   The definition for the order of traffic filtering rules from
   Section 5.1 of [RFC8955] is reused with new consideration for the
   IPv6 prefix offset.  As long as the offsets are equal, the comparison
   is the same, retaining longest-prefix-match semantics.  If the
   offsets are not equal, the lowest offset has precedence, as this Flow
   Specification matches the most significant bit.

   The code in Appendix A shows a Python3 implementation of the
   resulting comparison algorithm.  The full code was tested with Python
   3.7.2 and can be obtained at <https://github.com/stoffi92/draft-ietf-
   idr-flow-spec-v6/tree/master/flowspec-cmp>.

5.  Validation Procedure

   The validation procedure is the same as specified in Section 6 of
   [RFC8955] with the exception that item a) of the validation procedure
   should now read as follows:

   |  a)  A destination prefix component with offset=0 is embedded in
   |      the Flow Specification

6.  IPv6 Traffic Filtering Action Changes

   Traffic Filtering Actions from Section 7 of [RFC8955] can also be
   applied to IPv6 Flow Specifications.  To allow an IPv6-Address-
   Specific Route-Target, a new Traffic Filtering Action IPv6-Address-
   Specific Extended Community is specified in Section 6.1 below.

6.1.  Redirect IPv6 (rt-redirect-ipv6) Type 0x000d

   The redirect IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community allows the
   traffic to be redirected to a VRF routing instance that lists the
   specified IPv6-Address-Specific Route-Target in its import policy.
   If several local instances match this criteria, the choice between
   them is a local matter (for example, the instance with the lowest
   Route Distinguisher value can be elected).

   This IPv6-Address-Specific Extended Community uses the same encoding
   as the IPv6-Address-Specific Route-Target Extended Community
   (Section 2 of [RFC5701]) with the Type value always 0x000d.

   The Local Administrator subfield contains a number from a numbering
   space that is administered by the organization to which the IP
   address carried in the Global Administrator subfield has been
   assigned by an appropriate authority.

   Interferes with: All BGP Flow Specification redirect Traffic
   Filtering Actions (with itself and those specified in Section 7.4 of
   [RFC8955]).

7.  Security Considerations

   This document extends the functionality in [RFC8955] to be applicable
   to IPv6 data packets.  The same security considerations from
   [RFC8955] now also apply to IPv6 networks.

   [RFC7112] describes the impact of oversized IPv6 header chains when
   trying to match on the transport header; Section 4.5 of [RFC8200]
   also requires that the first fragment must include the upper-layer
   header, but there could be wrongly formatted packets not respecting
   [RFC8200].  IPv6 Flow Specification component Type 3 (Section 3.3)
   will not be enforced for those illegal packets.  Moreover, there are
   hardware limitations in several routers (Section 1 of [RFC8883]) that
   may make it impossible to enforce a policy signaled by a Type 3 Flow
   Specification component or Flow Specification components that match
   on upper-layer properties of the packet.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This section complies with [RFC7153].

8.1.  Flow Spec IPv6 Component Types

   IANA has created and maintains a registry entitled "Flow Spec
   Component Types".  IANA has added this document as a reference for
   that registry.  Furthermore, the registry has been updated to also
   contain the IPv6 Flow Specification Component Types as described
