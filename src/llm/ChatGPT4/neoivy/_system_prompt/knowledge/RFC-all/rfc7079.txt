The Pseudowire (PW) and Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV)
                     Implementation Survey Results

Abstract

   The IETF Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) working group has
   defined many encapsulations of various layer 1 and layer 2 service-
   specific PDUs and circuit data.  In most of these encapsulations, use
   of the Pseudowire (PW) Control Word is required.  However, there are
   several encapsulations for which the Control Word is optional, and
   this optionality has been seen in practice to possibly introduce
   interoperability concerns between multiple implementations of those
   encapsulations.  This survey of the Pseudowire / Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) user community was conducted to
   determine implementation trends and the possibility of always
   mandating the Control Word.

RFC 7079          PW/VCCV Implementation Survey Results    November 2013


1.  Introduction

   Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandate
   the use of the Control Word (CW) to carry information essential to
   the emulation, to inhibit Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) behavior, and
   to discriminate Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
   from Pseudowire (PW) packets.  However, some encapsulations treat the
   Control Word as optional.  As a result, implementations of the CW,
   for encapsulations for which it is optional, vary by equipment
   manufacturer, equipment model, and service provider network.
   Similarly, Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) supports
   three Control Channel (CC) types and multiple Connectivity
   Verification (CV) types.  This flexibility has led to reports of
   interoperability issues within deployed networks and associated
   documents to attempt to remedy the situation.

   The encapsulations and modes for which the Control Word is currently
   optional are:

   o  Ethernet Tagged Mode [RFC4448]

   o  Ethernet Raw Mode [RFC4448]

   o  Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC4618]

   o  High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) [RFC4618]

   o  Frame Relay Port Mode [RFC4618]

   o  ATM (N:1 Cell Mode) [RFC4717]

   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085] defines
   three Control Channel types for MPLS PWs: Type 1, using the PW
   Control Word; Type 2, using the Router Alert (RA) Label; and Type 3,
   using Time to Live (TTL) Expiration (e.g., MPLS PW Label with TTL ==
   1).  While Type 2 (RA Label) is indicated as being "the preferred
   mode of VCCV operation when the Control Word is not present", RFC
   5085 does not indicate a mandatory Control Channel to ensure
   interoperable implementations.  The closest it comes to mandating a
   control channel is the requirement to support Type 1 (Control Word)
   whenever the CW is present.  As such, the three options yield seven
   implementation permutations (assuming you have to support at least
   one Control Channel type to provide VCCV).  Due to these
   permutations, interoperability challenges have been identified by
   several VCCV users.

RFC 7079          PW/VCCV Implementation Survey Results    November 2013


   In order to assess the best approach to address the observed
   interoperability issues, the PWE3 working group decided to solicit
   feedback from the PW and VCCV user community regarding
   implementation.  This document presents the survey questionnaire and
   the information returned by those in the user community who
   participated.

1.1.  PW/VCCV Survey Overview

   Per the direction of the PWE3 working group chairs, a survey was
   created to sample the nature of implementations of PWs, with specific
   emphasis on Control Word usage, and VCCV, with emphasis on Control
   Channel and Control Type usage.  The survey consisted of a series of
   questions based on direction of the WG chairs and the survey opened
   to the public on November 4, 2010.  The survey was conducted using
   the SurveyMonkey tool, http://www.surveymonkey.com.  The survey ran
   from November 4, 2010 until February 25, 2011 and was repeatedly
   publicized on the PWE3 email list over that period.

   The editors took precautions to ensure the validity of the sample and
   the data.  Specifically, only responses with recognizable non-vendor
   company-affiliated email addresses were accepted.  Unrecognizable or
   personal email addresses would have been contacted to determine their
   validity, but none were received.  Only one response was received
   from each responding company.  If multiple responses from a company
   had been received, they would have been contacted to determine
   whether the responses were duplicative or additive.  This, however,
   did not occur.

1.2.  PW/VCCV Survey Form

   The PW/VCCV Implementation Survey requested the following information
   about user implementations (the lists of implementation choices were
   taken verbatim from the survey):

   -  Responding Organization.  No provisions were made for anonymous
      responses, as all responses required a valid email address in
      order to validate the survey response.  However, the results
      herein are reported anonymously, except for an alphabetic list of
      participating organizations in Section 2.2.

         Transport of Fibre Channel" (now RFC 6307)

   -  Approximately how many PWs of each type were deployed.
      Respondents could list a number, or for the sake of privacy, could
      just respond "In-Use" instead.

   -  For each encapsulation listed above, the respondent could indicate
      which Control Channel [RFC5085] was in use.  (See Section 1 for a
      discussion of these Control Channels.)  The options listed were:

      o  Control Word (Type 1)

      o  Router Alert Label (Type 2)

      o  TTL Expiry (Type 3)

   -  For each encapsulation listed above, the respondent could indicate

      options were:

      o  Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Ping

      o  Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping

   -  For each encapsulation type for which the Control Word is
      optional, the respondents could indicate the encapsulation(s) for
      which Control Word was supported by the equipment vendor, and
      whether the CW was also in use in the network.  The encapsulations
      listed were:

      o  Ethernet (Tagged Mode)

      o  Ethernet (Raw Mode)

      o  PPP

      o  HDLC

   -  Finally, a free-form entry was provided for the respondent to
      provide feedback regarding PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV
      interoperability challenges, or the survey or any other network/
      vendor details they wished to share.

1.3.  PW/VCCV Survey Highlights

   There were seventeen responses to the survey that met the validity
   requirements in Section 1.1.  The responding companies are listed
   below in Section 2.2.

2.  Survey Results

2.1.  Summary of Results

   Prior to this survey, there was considerable speculation about
   whether the Control Word could always be mandated, with several
   proposals to do so.  However, the survey showed that there was
   considerable deployment of PWs that did not use the CW.  The
   publication of this survey serves as a reminder of the extent of PWs
   without the CW in use, and hence a reminder that the CW-less modes
   cannot be deprecated in the near future.

2.2.  Respondents

   The following companies, listed here alphabetically as received in
   the survey responses, participated in the PW/VCCV Implementation
   Survey.  Responses were only solicited from non-vendors (users and
   service providers), and no vendors responded (although if they had,
   their response would not have been included).  The data provided has
   been aggregated.  No specific company's response will be detailed
   herein.

2.4.  Number of Pseudowires Deployed

   The following question was asked: "Approximately how many pseudowires
   are deployed of each encapsulation type.  Note, this should be the
   number of pseudowires in service, carrying traffic, or pre-positioned
   to do so."  The following list shows the number of pseudowires in use
   for each encapsulation:

   o  Ethernet Tagged Mode = 93,861

   o  Ethernet Raw Mode = 94,231

   o  SAToP - RFC 4553 = 20,050

   o  PPP - RFC 4618 = 500

      of Fibre Channel" (now RFC 6307) = 0

   In the above responses (on several occasions), the response was in
   the form of "> XXXXX" where the response indicated a number greater
   than the one provided.  Where applicable, the number itself was used
   in the sums above.  For example, ">20K" and "20K+" yielded 20K.

2.8.  Open-Ended Question

   Space was provided for user feedback.  The following instructions
   were given: "Please use this space to provide any feedback regarding
   PW and VCCV deployments, VCCV interoperability challenges, this
   survey or any network/vendor details you wish to share."  Below are
   the responses, made anonymous.  The responses are otherwise provided
   here verbatim.

   1.  BFD VCCV Control Channel is not indicated in the survey (may be
       required for PW redundancy purpose)

   2.  Using CV is not required at the moment

   3.  COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple
       vendors.  COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV
       Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor
       platforms.  This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages
       in reduced operational overheads when handling cross-domain
       faults.  Having a uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY
       multi-vendor network leads to:

       o  Reduced operational cost and complexity

       o  Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible VCCV
          implementations.

       o  Increased end-end service availability when handing faults.

       In addition, currently some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic
       flows (on some vendor platforms) are not guaranteed to follow
       those of the customer's application traffic (a key operational
       requirement).  As a result, the response from the circuit ping
       cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit.  This leads
       to ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks.
       An in-band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a
       clear preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word.
       This preference is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.

   4.  PW VCCV is very useful tool for finding faults in each PW
       channel.  Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel.  PW
       VCCV using BFD is another better option.  Interoperability
       challenges are with Ethernet OAM mechanism.

   5.  We are using L2PVPN AToM like-to-like models - ATMoMPLS - EoMPLS
       ATMoMPLS : This service offered for transporting ATM cells over
       IP/MPLS core with Edge ATM CE devices including BPX, Ericsson
       Media Gateway etc.  This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing
       configuration on it to have best performance.  QoS marking is
       done for getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS
       encapsulated ATM packets.  EoMPLS: This service offered for
       transporting 2G/3G traffic from network such as Node-B to RNC's
       over IP/MPLS backbone core network.  QoS marking is done for
       getting guaranteed bandwidth treatment in the core for these MPLS
       encapsulated ATM packets.  In addition to basic L2VPN service
       configuration, these traffic are routed via MPLS TE tunnels with
       dedicated path and bandwidth defined to avoid bandwidth related
       congestion.

   6.  EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER does not provide options to configure VCCV
       control-channel and its sub options for LDP based L2Circuits.
       How can we achieve end-to-end management and fault detection of
       PW without VCCV in such cases?

   7.  I'm very interested in this work as we continue to experience
       interop challenges particularly with newer vendors to the space
       who are only implementing VCCV via control word.  Vendors who
       have tailed their MPLS OAM set specifically to the cell backhaul
       space and mandatory CW have been known to fall into this space.
       That's all I've got.

3.  Security Considerations

   As this document is an informational report of the PW/VCCV User
   Implementation Survey results, no protocol security considerations
   are introduced.

4.  Acknowledgements

   We would like to thank the chairs of the PWE3 working group for their
   guidance and review of the survey questions.  We would also like to
   sincerely thank those listed in Section 2.2. who took the time and
   effort to participate.

       Media Gateway etc.  This is purely a Port mode with cell-packing
       configuration on it to have best performance.  QoS marking is
       done for getting LLQ treatment in the core for these MPLS
       encapsulated ATM packets.  EoMPLS: This service offered for
       transporting 2G/3G traffic from network such as Node-B to RNC's
       over IP/MPLS backbone core network.  QoS marking is done for
       getting guaranteed bandwidth treatment in the core for these MPLS
       encapsulated ATM packets.  In addition to basic L2VPN service
       configuration, these traffic are routed via MPLS TE tunnels with
       dedicated path and bandwidth defined to avoid bandwidth related
       congestion.

       PW VCCV is very useful tool for finding faults in each PW
       channel.  Without this we can not find fault on a PW channel.  PW
       VCCV using BFD is another better option.  Interoperability
       challenges are with Ethernet OAM mechanism.

       COMPANY has deployed several MPLS network elements, from multiple
       vendors.  COMPANY is seeking a uniform implementation of VCCV
       Control Channel (CC) capabilities across its various vendor
       platforms.  This will provide COMPANY with significant advantages
       in reduced operational overheads when handling cross-domain
       faults.  Having a uniform VCCV feature implementation in COMPANY
       multi-vendor network leads to:

       o   Reduced operational cost and complexity

       o   Reduced OSS development to coordinate incompatible VCCV
           implementations.

       o   Increased end-end service availability when handing faults.

       In addition, currently some of COMPANY deployed VCCV traffic
       flows (on some vendor platforms) are not guaranteed to follow
       those of the customer's application traffic (a key operational
       requirement).  As a result, the response from the circuit ping
       cannot faithfully reflect the status of the circuit.  This leads
       to ambiguity regarding the operational status of our networks.
       An in-band method is highly preferred, with COMPANY having a
       clear preference for VCCV Circuit Ping using PWE Control Word.
       This preference is being pursued with each of COMPANY vendors.
