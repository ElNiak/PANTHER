               Digital Image Processing Software Systems
                            July 17-18, 1973
                   University of Southern California


The University of Southern California Image Processing Institute in
conjunction with the Advanced Research Projects Agency, Information
Processing Techniques Office is sponsoring a technical meeting on
digital image processing software systems.  The meeting will be held at
USC on July 17-18, 1973.  The purpose of the meeting is to consider the
existing hardware facilities and software systems suitable for large
scale image processing operations over the ARPANET.  Additionally,
preliminary consideration will be given to the potential development of
universal image processing software that will be of utility to the
entire image processing R & D community.

Representatives of interested organizations are invited to attend the
technical meeting.  Attendees should contact:

         Professor William K. Pratt
         Olin Hall, Room 330H
