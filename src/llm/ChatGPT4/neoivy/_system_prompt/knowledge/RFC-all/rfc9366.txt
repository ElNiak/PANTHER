                Multiple SIP Reason Header Field Values

Abstract

   The SIP Reason header field as defined in RFC 3326 allows only one
   Reason value per protocol value.  Experience with more recently
   defined protocols shows it is useful to allow multiple values with
   the same protocol value.  This document updates RFC 3326 to allow
   multiple values for an indicated registered protocol when that
   protocol defines what the presence of multiple values means.

1.  Introduction

   The SIP Reason header field as defined in RFC 3326 allows only one
   Reason value per protocol value.  Experience with more recently
   defined protocols shows it is useful to allow multiple values with
   the same protocol value [STIRREASONS].  This document updates RFC
   3326 to allow multiple values for an indicated registered protocol
   when that protocol defines what the presence of multiple values
   means.  It does not change the requirement in RFC 3326 restricting
   the header field contents to one value per protocol for those
   protocols that do not define what multiple values mean.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Update to RFC 3326

   The last paragraph of Section 2 of [RFC3326] is replaced as follows:

   OLD:

   |  A SIP message MAY contain more than one Reason value (i.e.,
   |  multiple Reason lines), but all of them MUST have different
   |  protocol values (e.g., one SIP and another Q.850).  An
   |  implementation is free to ignore Reason values that it does not
   |  understand.

   NEW:

   |  A SIP message MAY contain more than one Reason value (i.e.,
   |  multiple Reason lines).  If the registered protocol for the Reason
   |  value specifies what it means for multiple values to occur in one
   |  message, more than one value for that protocol MAY be present.
   |  Otherwise, there MUST be only one value per protocol provided
   |  (e.g., one SIP and another Q.850).  An implementation is free to
   |  ignore Reason values that it does not understand.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document adds no security considerations to the use of SIP.  The
   security considerations in [RFC3326] and those in any registered
   protocols used in Reason header field values should be considered.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
