            Email Authentication for Internationalized Mail

Abstract

   Sender Policy Framework (SPF) (RFC 7208), DomainKeys Identified Mail
   (DKIM) (RFC 6376), and Domain-based Message Authentication,
   Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) (RFC 7489) enable a domain owner
   to publish email authentication and policy information in the DNS.
   In internationalized email, domain names can occur both as U-labels
   and A-labels.  This specification updates the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
   specifications to clarify which form of internationalized domain
   names to use in those specifications.

1.  Introduction

   SPF [RFC7208], DKIM [RFC6376], and DMARC [RFC7489] enable a domain
   owner to publish email authentication and policy information in the
   DNS.  SPF primarily publishes information about what host addresses
   are authorized to send mail for a domain.  DKIM places cryptographic
   signatures on email messages, with the validation keys published in
   the DNS.  DMARC publishes policy information related to the domain in
   the From: header field of email messages.

   In conventional email, all domain names are ASCII in all contexts, so
   there is no question about the representation of the domain names.
   All internationalized domain names are represented as A-labels
   [RFC5890] in message header fields, SMTP sessions, and the DNS.

   Internationalized mail [RFC6530] (generally called "EAI" for Email
   Address Internationalization) allows U-labels in SMTP sessions
   [RFC6531] and message header fields [RFC6532].

   Every U-label is equivalent to an A-label, so in principle, the
   choice of label format will not cause ambiguities.  But in practice,
   consistent use of label formats will make it more likely that code
   for mail senders and receivers interoperates.

   Internationalized mail also allows UTF-8-encoded Unicode characters
   in the local parts of mailbox names, which were historically only
   ASCII.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

RFC 8616                   EAI Authentication                  June 2019


   The term "IDN", for Internationalized Domain Name, refers to a domain
   name containing either U-labels or A-labels.

   Since DMARC is not currently a Standards Track protocol, this
   specification offers advice rather than requirements for DMARC.

3.  General Principles

   In headers in EAI mail messages, domain names that were restricted to
   ASCII can be U-labels, and mailbox local parts can be UTF-8.  Header
   field names and other text intended primarily to be interpreted by
   computers rather than read by people remains ASCII.

   Strings stored in DNS records remain ASCII since there is no way to
   tell whether a client retrieving a DNS record expects an EAI or an
   ASCII result.  When a domain name found in a mail header field
   includes U-labels, those labels are translated to A-labels before
   being looked up in the DNS, as described in [RFC5891].

4.  SPF and Internationalized Mail

   SPF [RFC7208] uses two identities from the SMTP session: the host
   name in the EHLO command and the domain in the address in the MAIL
   FROM command.  Since the EHLO command precedes the server response
   that tells whether the server supports the SMTPUTF8 extension, an IDN
   host name MUST be represented as A-labels.  An IDN in MAIL FROM can
   be either U-labels or A-labels.

   All U-labels MUST be converted to A-labels before being used for an
   SPF validation.  This includes both the labels in the name used for
   the original DNS lookup, described in Section 3 of [RFC7208], and
   those used in the macro expansion of domain-spec, described in
   Section 7.  Section 4.3 of [RFC7208] states that all IDNs in an SPF
   DNS record MUST be A-labels; this rule is unchanged since any SPF
   record can be used to authorize either EAI or conventional mail.

   SPF macros %{s} and %{l} expand the local part of the sender's
   mailbox.  If the local part contains non-ASCII characters, terms that
   include %{s} or %{l} do not match anything, because non-ASCII local
   parts cannot be used as the DNS labels the macros are intended to
   match.  Since these macros are rarely used, this is unlikely to be an
   issue in practice.

5.  DKIM and Internationalized Mail

   DKIM [RFC6376] specifies a mail header field that contains a
   cryptographic message signature and a DNS record that contains the
   validation key.

RFC 8616                   EAI Authentication                  June 2019


   Section 2.11 of [RFC6376] defines dkim-quoted-printable.  Its
   definition is modified in messages with internationalized header
   fields so that non-ASCII UTF-8 characters need not be quoted.  The
   ABNF [RFC5234] for dkim-safe-char in those messages is replaced by
   the following, adding non-ASCII UTF-8 characters from [RFC3629]:

   dkim-safe-char        =  %x21-3A / %x3C / %x3E-7E /
                                       UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4
                            ; '!' - ':', '<', '>' - '~', non-ASCII

   UTF8-2                = <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>

   UTF8-3                = <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>

   UTF8-4                = <Defined in Section 4 of RFC 3629>

   Section 3.5 of [RFC6376] states that IDNs in the d=, i=, and s= tags
   of a DKIM-Signature header field MUST be encoded as A-labels.  This
   rule is relaxed only for internationalized message header fields
   [RFC6532], so IDNs SHOULD be represented as U-labels.  This provides
   improved consistency with other header fields.  (A-labels remain
   valid to allow a transition from older software.)  The set of
   allowable characters in the local part of an i= tag is extended in
   the same fashion as local parts of email addresses as described in
   Section 3.2 of [RFC6532].  When computing or verifying the hash in a
   DKIM signature as described in Section 3.7 of [RFC6376], the hash
   MUST use the domain name in the format it occurs in the header field.

   Section 3.4.2 of [RFC6376] describes relaxed header canonicalization.
   Its first step converts all header field names from uppercase to
   lowercase.  Field names are restricted to printable ASCII (see
   [RFC5322], Section 3.6.8), so this case conversion remains ASCII case
   conversion.

   DKIM key records, described in Section 3.6.1 of [RFC6376], do not
   contain domain names, so there is no change to their specification.

6.  DMARC and Internationalized Mail

   DMARC [RFC7489] defines a policy language that domain owners can
   specify for the domain of the address in an RFC5322.From header
   field.

   Section 6.6.1 of [RFC7489] specifies, somewhat imprecisely, how IDNs
   in the RFC5322.From address domain are to be handled.  That section
   is updated to say that all U-labels in the domain are converted to
   A-labels before further processing.  Section 7.1 of [RFC7489] is

RFC 8616                   EAI Authentication                  June 2019


   similarly updated to say that all U-labels in domains being handled
   are converted to A-labels before further processing.

   DMARC policy records, described in Sections 6.3 and 7.1 of [RFC7489],
   can contain email addresses in the "rua" and "ruf" tags.  Since a
   policy record can be used for both internationalized and conventional
   mail, those addresses still have to be conventional addresses, not
   internationalized addresses.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   Email is subject to a vast range of threats and abuses.  This
   document attempts to slightly mitigate some of them but does not, as
   far as the author knows, add any new ones.  The updates to SPF, DKIM,
   and DMARC are intended to allow the respective specifications to work
   as reliably on internationalized mail as they do on ASCII mail, so
   that applications that use them, such as some kinds of mail filters
   that catch spam and phish, can work more reliably on
   internationalized mail.
