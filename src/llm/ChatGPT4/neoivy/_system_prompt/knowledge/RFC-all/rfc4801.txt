                Definitions of Textual Conventions for
      Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Management

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module that
   contains textual conventions (TCs) to represent commonly used
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) management
   information.  The intent is that these textual conventions will be
   imported and used in GMPLS-related MIB modules that would otherwise
   define their own representations.

RFC 4801                TCs for GMPLS Management           February 2007


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a MIB module that contains textual conventions
   (TCs) for Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks.
   These textual conventions should be imported by MIB modules that
   manage GMPLS networks.

   This MIB module supplements the MIB module in [RFC3811] that defines
   textual conventions for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   management.  [RFC3811] may continue to be used without this MIB
   module in networks that support only MPLS.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   For an introduction to the concepts of GMPLS, see [RFC3945].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

        that contains any GMPLS Label.  Objects with this syntax can be

        gmplsMplsLabel(1)           - The label is an MPLS Packet, Cell,
                                      or Frame Label and is encoded as
                                      described for the TEXTUAL-

                                      Label as defined in RFC 3471.

        gmplsFreeformLabel(3)       - The label is any form of label
                                      encoded as an OCTET STRING using
                                      the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
                                      GmplsFreeformLabel.

                                      defined in RFC 4606.

        gmplsSdhLabel(5)            - The label is a Synchronous Digital

                                      in RFC 4606.

       "The direction of data flow on an Label Switched Path (LSP)
        segment with respect to the head of the LSP.

        Where an LSP is signaled using a conventional signaling
        protocol, the 'head' of the LSP is the source of the signaling
        (also known as the ingress) and the 'tail' is the destination
        (also known as the egress).  For unidirectional LSPs, this
        usually matches the direction of flow of data.

        For manually configured unidirectional LSPs, the direction of
        the LSP segment matches the direction of flow of data.  For
        manually configured bidirectional LSPs, an arbitrary decision
        must be made about which LER is the 'head'."
     SYNTAX  INTEGER {
       forward(1),   -- data flows from head-end of LSP toward tail-end
       reverse(2)    -- data flows from tail-end of LSP toward head-end

   END

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other GMPLS
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has rooted MIB objects in this MIB module under the mplsStdMIB
   subtree by assigning an OID to gmplsTCStdMIB.

   IANA has made the following assignments in the "NETWORK MANAGEMENT
   PARAMETERS" registry located at http://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-
   numbers in table:

   ...mib-2.transmission.mplsStdMIB (1.3.6.1.2.1.10.166)

      Decimal  Name              References
      -------  -----             ----------
      12       GMPLS-TC-STD-MIB  [RFC4801]

   In the future, GMPLS-related standards-track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB (sic) subtree.  IANA has been requested
   to manage that namespace in the SMI Numbers registry [RFC3811].  New
   assignments can only be made via a Standards Action as specified in
   [RFC2434].
