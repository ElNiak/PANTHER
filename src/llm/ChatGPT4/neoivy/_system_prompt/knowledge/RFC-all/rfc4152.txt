Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace
   (RFC 3406) for the assignment of the Common Language Equipment
   Identifier (CLEI) code, which is used in messages standardized by
   ANSI.  The URN namespace is managed by Telcordia Technologies, Inc.,
   as the maintenance agent for ANSI T1.213.  The CLEI code is a
   globally unique, ten-character alphanumeric intelligent code assigned
   by Telcordia Technologies at the request of equipment suppliers.  The
   CLEI code identifies communications equipment by specifying product
   type and features.  There is a one-to-one relationship between a CLEI
   code and supplier's product ID (the manufacturer's name and the part
   number along with its version number).

RFC 4152            URN Namespace for the CLEI Code          August 2005


1.  Introduction

   Many circuit cards used in the global telecommunications network have
   a CLEI code assigned and have a bar code or two-dimensional symbol on
   a label affixed to the front.  Service providers utilize the CLEI
   code to:

   o  Track inventory, both working and spare

   o  Handle logistics (movement of circuit cards, along with the serial
      number)

   o  Provision equipment

   o  Maintain asset records (accounting information)

   The goal of the CLEI namespace is to ensure the stability and
   uniqueness of the names of various (specific) items that are used
   within the messages exchanged between equipment of the global
   telecommunications network.

   The assigned maintenance agent for the CLEI code, Telcordia
   Technologies, is responsible for assigning certain equipment and
   other identifiers (e.g., location, manufacturer/supplier) for the
   telecommunications industry.  The code assignment process identifies
   the structure and intelligence of the CLEI code to identify the
   circuit card's form, fit, functions, and features.  Equipment may
   exist in multiple physical locations with the exact same form, fit,
   functions, and features; such equipment will have the same CLEI code
   if their product ID is the same.

   Declaration of syntactic structures:

      The structure of the Namespace Specific String is a flat space of
      10 characters, as defined in [T1.213][T1.213a].

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      [T1.213] and [T1.213a].

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      Identifiers are assigned by Telcordia URN registration that
      guarantees uniqueness for items with different form, fit,
      functions, and features.  This is achieved simply by comparing all
      new proposed names to the already assigned names contained in a
      database.  If the name already exists, a new one is created per
      the rules of the process.  See [T1.213][T1.213a] for assignment
      examples.

   Identifiers persistence considerations:

      The process defined by ANSI and the CLEI maintenance agent ensure
      that the binding between the name and its resource is permanent,
      and that names are not reassigned.

   Process of identifiers assignment:

      A CLEI code is an intelligent code that consists of 10
      alphanumeric characters with 4 data elements.  The first data
      element is considered the basic code with the first 2 characters
      indicating the technology or equipment type, and the third and
      fourth characters denoting the functional sub-category.  The
      second data element represents the features, and its three
      characters denote functional capabilities or changes.  The third
      data element has one character and denotes a reference to a
      manufacturer, system ID, specification, or drawing.  The fourth
      data element consists of two characters and contains complementary
      data.  These two characters provide a means of differentiating or
      providing uniqueness between the eight character CLEI codes by
      identifying the manufacturing vintage of the product.  Names are
      assigned via procedures defined in [GR485].

   Process for identifier resolution:

      Telcordia URNs are resolved via Telcordia resolvers run under
      Telcordia responsibility.  For further information see
      www.commonlanguage.com.

   Rules for lexical equivalence:

      Lexical equivalence of two CLEI URN namespace specific strings is
      defined as an exact, case-insensitive string match.  CLEI codes
      are assigned in a case-insensitive fashion, so that there will not
      be two CLEI codes that differ only in case.  See [T1.213] and
      [T1.213a] for further information.

   Conformance with URN syntax:

      No special consideration.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.

   Scope:

      Global.

3.  Examples

   The following three examples are based on the examples provided in
   [T1.213a], and correspond with three different sets of features by
   three different manufacturers (Nortel Networks, Lear, and Lucent
   Technologies) producing "D4CE" (a particular D4 channel bank type)
   equipment.  The fourth example refers to a SONET power unit convertor
   of Alcatel.

      URN:CLEI:D4CE18B7AA
      URN:CLEI:D4CE4248AA
      URN:CLEI:D4CE363PAB
      URN:CLEI:SNPWBBC7AA

4.  Namespace and Community Considerations

   CLEI codes have historically been used in a variety of communications
   equipment (see examples above and [T1.213a]).  There are
   circumstances in which entities with CLEI codes need to be managed or
   exposed in a larger context, such as the general Internet.  In these

   cases, the use of the CLEI URN namespace will provide general
   interoperability benefits to the Internet at large, as well as to
   specific internets.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

   However, note that attempting to resolve a Telcordia URN through a
   resolver other than the one provided by Telcordia is not considered
   authoritative.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has registered the formal URN namespace CLEI within the IANA
   registry of URN NIDs.
