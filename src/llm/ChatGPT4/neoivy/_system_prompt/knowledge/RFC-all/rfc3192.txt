Abstract

   This memo describes a simple method of encoding Global Switched
   Telephone Network (GSTN) addresses of facsimile devices in the
   local-part of Internet email addresses.

1. Introduction

   As with all Internet mail addresses, the left-hand-side (local-part)
   of an address generated according to this specification, is not to be
   interpreted except by the MTA that is named on the right-hand-side
   (domain).

   Since the very first e-mail to fax gateway objects appeared, a number
   of different methods to specify a fax address as an e-mail address
   have been used by implementors.  Several objectives for this methods
   have been identified, like to enable an e-mail user to send and
   receive faxes from his/her e-mail interface, to allow some kind of
   "fax over e-mail service" transport (possibly reducing the costs of
   GSTN long distance transmissions) while using the existing e-mail
   infrastructure.

   This memo describes the MINIMAL addressing method and standard
   extensions to encode FAX addresses into e-mail addresses, as required
   in reference [13].  The opposite problem, i.e., to allow a
   traditional numeric-only fax device user to access the e-mail
   transport service, is not discussed here.

RFC 3192      Minimal FAX address format in Internet Mail   October 2001


   These IANA forms used to register the standard elements defined here
   are given in the "IANA Considerations" chapter (section 7 of this
   document).

   All implementations supporting FAX over e-mail address format MUST
   support this minimal specification.

1.1 Terminology and Syntax conventions

   In this document the formal definitions are described using ABNF
   syntax, as defined into [7].  We will also use some of the "CORE
   DEFINITIONS" defined in "APPENDIX A - CORE" of that document.  The
   exact meaning of the capitalized words

      "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
      "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", "OPTIONAL"

   is defined in reference [6].

   In this document the following new terms are also defined:

      I-fax device:
         an I-pstn device type [13] which is able to communicate either
         directly or indirectly with the traditional FAX over GSTN
         service;

      mta-I-fax:
         the Internet domain name which identifies uniquely an I-fax
         device over the Internet (see also mta-I-pstn in [13]);

      fax-email:
         the complete Internet e-mail address structure which is used to
         transport a FAX address over the Internet e-mail service (see
         also pstn-email in [13]).

2. Minimal Fax address

   The minimal fax address within e-mail has been defined for
   consistency with reference [13] and it contains two elements: the
   fax-mbox and an optional qualif-type1 element.

   More precisely the GSTN minimal address specification requires the
   use of a unique service-selector for each specific application
   (section 2 in [13]).

   The "service-selector" defined for the fax service is as follows:

      service-selector = "FAX"



Allocchio                   Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 3192      Minimal FAX address format in Internet Mail   October 2001


   In the syntax for the fax address a qualif-type1 element has been
   defined for support of T.30/T.33 subaddresses (see section 2 of
   [13]).  The use of this element is OPTIONAL, but compliant
   implementations MUST be able to support and correctly interpret it
   when present.  Its definition is as follows:

      qualif-type1 = "/" t33-sep "=" sub-addr

   where

      t33-sep = "T33S"

      sub-addr = 1*( DIGIT )

   Thus, the minimal specification of a fax in e-mail address is:

      fax-address = fax-mbox [ "/T33S=" sub-addr ]

      fax-mbox = "FAX=" global-phone

   Notes:

      For the case of a single subaddress, only numbers are allowed in
      <sub-addr> which is consistent with T.30, T.33, and this document.
      While T.30 and T.33 use SPACE to pad its field, padding isn't
      necessary in the <sub-addr> field defined by this document.

      For the case of multiple subaddresses, T.33 specifies the "#"
      character be used to specify multiple subaddreses.  However, only
      digits are permitted in the <sub-addr> field defined by this
      document.  Refer to section 4.1 in case multiple <sub-addr> per
      per <fax-mbox> need to be specified.

   The Minimal supported syntax for global-phone (as described in
   section 2.1 of reference [13]) is:

   global-phone = "+" 1*( DIGIT / written-sep )

   written-sep = ( "-" / "." )

   Refer to section 2.1 in [13] for other important considerations about
   the global-phone element.

2.2 Some examples of a minimal "fax-address"

   Some examples of minimal fax-address follows:

RFC 3192      Minimal FAX address format in Internet Mail   October 2001


      FAX=+3940226338

      FAX=+12027653000/T33S=1387

      FAX=+33-1-88335215

   Note:

      the examples shown are just for illustration purposes.

3. The e-mail address of the I-fax device: mta-I-fax

   An "I-fax device" has, among its characteristics, a unique Internet
   domain name which identifies it on the Internet.  Within Internet
   mail, this is the Right Hand Side (RHS) part of the address, i.e.,
   the part on the right of the "@" sign.  For purposes of this document
   we will call this "mta-I-fax"

      mta-I-fax = domain

   For "domain" strings used in SMTP transmissions, the string MUST
   conform to the requirements of that standards <domain> specifications
   [1], [3].  For "domain" strings used in message content headers, the
   string MUST conform to the requirements of the relevant standards
   [2], [3].

   Note:

      the use of "domain names" or "domain literals" is permitted in
      addresses in both the SMTP envelope and message header fields.

4. The fax-email

   The complete structure used to transfer a minimal FAX address over
   the Internet e-mail transport system is called "fax-email".  This
   object is a an e-mail address which conforms to [2] and [3]
   "addr-spec" syntax, with structure refinements which allows the FAX
   number to be identified.

   fax-email = ["""] ["/"] fax-address ["/"] ["""] "@" mta-I-fax

   Implementors' note:

      The optional "/" characters can result from translations from
      other transport gateways (such as some X.400 gateways) which have
      included the "/" as an optional element.  Implementations MUST
      accept the optional slashes but SHOULD NOT generate them.
      Gateways are allowed to strip them off when converting to Internet



Allocchio                   Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 3192      Minimal FAX address format in Internet Mail   October 2001


      mail addressing.  The relevant standard [2], [3] define exactly
      when the optional "quotes" characters surrounding the entire local
      part (i.e., the part on the left of the "@" character into the
      fax-email) MUST be added.

4.1 Multiple subaddresses

   There are some instances in GSTN applications where multiple
   subaddresses are used: T.33 subaddresses in fax service are one of
   these cases.  In e-mail practice a separate and unique e-mail address
   is always used for each recipient; as such, if multiple T.33
   subaddresses are present, the use of multiple "fax-email" elements is
   REQUIRED.

   Implementors' note:

      The UA MAY accept multiple subaddress elements for the same
      global-phone, but it MUST generate multiple "fax-mbox" elements
      when submitting the message to the MTA.

4.2 Some examples of minimal "fax-email"

      Some examples of minimal fax-email addresses follows:

      FAX=+3940226338@faxworld.org

      FAX=+12027653000/T33S=1387@faxworld.org

      /FAX=+33-1-88335215/@faxworld.org

   Note:

      the examples shown are just for illustration purposes.

5. Conclusion

   This proposal creates a minimal standard encoding for FAX addresses
   within the global e-mail transport system.  The proposal is
   consistent with existing e-mail standards.

6. Security Considerations

   This document specifies a means by which FAX addresses can be encoded
   into e-mail addresses.  Since e-mail routing is determined by Domain
   Name System (DNS) data, a successful attack to DNS could disseminate
   tampered information, which causes e-mail messages to be diverted via
   some MTA or Gateway where the security of the software has been
   compromised.

RFC 3192      Minimal FAX address format in Internet Mail   October 2001


   There are several means by which an attacker might be able to deliver
   incorrect mail routing information to a client.  These include: (a)
   compromise of a DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to
   a client's DNS query, (c) returning incorrect "additional
   information" in response to an unrelated query.  Clients SHOULD
   ensure that mail routing is based only on authoritative answers.
   Once DNS Security mechanisms [5] become more widely deployed, clients
   SHOULD employ those mechanisms to verify the authenticity and
   integrity of mail routing records.

7. IANA Considerations

   The IANA registration forms for "FAX" service-selector and "T33S"
   qualif-type1 elements are defined here.  These forms update the
   previous registration forms defined in [15].

7.1 IANA Registration form for updated value of GSTN
    address service-selector "FAX"

8. Changes since RFC 2304 specification

   Although there are no major or technical changes from RFC 2304
   specification, this section briefly describes where updates and
   clarifications were introduced:

   -  considering the case that telephony systems do not conform any
      more to the "single/few" Public Operator paradigm, the old
      definition "PSTN - Public Switched Telephone Network" was changed
      into the more adequate "GSTN - Global Switched Telephone Network"
      one.  However, in order to remain consistent with the previous
      specification, the ABNF variables names were not changed.

   -  section 7 "IANA Considerations" and the IANA registration forms
      for the "FAX" "service-selector" and for the "T33S" "qualif-type1"
      elements were added;

   -  an explicit list of "new terms" with explanations was added to
      section 1.1;

   -  the case when multiple T.33 subaddresses are present was described
      more explicitly in order to clarify how to handle them (section
      4.1);

   -  in section 3 the language describing "mta-I-fax" was updated to
      better describe its relationship with an Internet Mail address;

   -  in section 4., the quoting rules of the "fax-address" and their
      practical use was made explicit both in the definition of "fax-
      email" and in the Implementors' note;

   -  the Author's Address was updated;

   -  the References list was updates to substitute ITU E.164 (1991)
      with ITU E.164 (1997).
