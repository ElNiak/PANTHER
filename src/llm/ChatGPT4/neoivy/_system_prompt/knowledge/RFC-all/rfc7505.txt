 A "Null MX" No Service Resource Record for Domains That Accept No Mail

Abstract

   Internet mail determines the address of a receiving server through
   the DNS, first by looking for an MX record and then by looking for an
   A/AAAA record as a fallback.  Unfortunately, this means that the
   A/AAAA record is taken to be mail server address even when that
   address does not accept mail.  The No Service MX RR, informally
   called "null MX", formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain
   announces that it accepts no mail, without having to provide a mail
   server; this permits significant operational efficiencies.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the No Service MX, informally called "null MX",
   as a simple mechanism by which a domain can indicate that it does not
   accept email.

   SMTP clients have a prescribed sequence for identifying a server that
   accepts email for a domain.  Section 5 of [RFC5321] covers this in
   detail; in essence, the SMTP client first looks up a DNS MX RR, and,
   if that is not found, it falls back to looking up a DNS A or AAAA RR.
   Hence, this overloads a DNS record (that has a different primary
   mission) with an email service semantic.

   If a domain has no MX records, senders will attempt to deliver mail
   to the hosts at the addresses in the domain's A or AAAA records.  If
   there are no SMTP listeners at the A/AAAA addresses, message delivery
   will be attempted repeatedly for a long period, typically a week,
   before the sending Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) gives up.  This will
   delay notification to the sender in the case of misdirected mail and
   will consume resources at the sender.

   This document defines a null MX that will cause all mail delivery
   attempts to a domain to fail immediately, without requiring domains
   to create SMTP listeners dedicated to preventing delivery attempts.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

RFC 7505                         Null MX                       June 2015


   The terms "RFC5321.MailFrom" and "RFC5322.From" are used as defined
   in [RFC5598].

3.  MX Resource Records Specifying Null MX

   To indicate that a domain does not accept email, it advertises a
   single MX RR (see Section 3.3.9 of [RFC1035]) with an RDATA section
   consisting of preference number 0 and a zero-length label, written in
   master files as ".", as the exchange domain, to denote that there
   exists no mail exchanger for a domain.  Since "." is not a valid host
   name, a null MX record cannot be confused with an ordinary MX record.
   The use of "." as a pseudo-hostname meaning no service available is
   modeled on the SRV RR [RFC2782] where it has a similar meaning.

   A domain that advertises a null MX MUST NOT advertise any other MX
   RR.

4.  Effects of Null MX

   The null MX record has a variety of efficiency and usability
   benefits.

4.1.  SMTP Server Benefits

   Mail often has an incorrect address due to user error, where the
   address was mistranscribed or misunderstood, for example, to
   alice@www.example.com, alice@example.org, or alice@examp1e.com rather
   than alice@example.com.  Null MX allows a mail system to report the
   delivery failure when the user sends the message, rather than hours
   or days later.

   Senders of abusive mail often use forged undeliverable return
   addresses.  Null MX allows Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) and
   other attempted responses to such mail to be disposed of efficiently.

   The ability to detect domains that do not accept email offers
   resource savings to an SMTP client.  It will discover on the first
   sending attempt that an address is not deliverable, avoiding queuing
   and retries.

   When a submission or SMTP relay server rejects an envelope recipient
   due to a domain's null MX record, it SHOULD use a 556 reply code
   [RFC7504] (Requested action not taken: domain does not accept mail)
   and a 5.1.10 enhanced status code (Permanent failure: Recipient
   address has null MX).

RFC 7505                         Null MX                       June 2015


   A receiving SMTP server that chooses to reject email during the SMTP
   conversation that presents an undeliverable RFC5321.MailFrom or
   RFC5322.From domain can be more confident that for other messages a
   subsequent attempt to send a DSN or other response will reach a
   recipient SMTP server.

   SMTP servers that reject mail because a RFC5321.MailFrom or
   RFC5322.From domain has a null MX record SHOULD use a 550 reply code
   (Requested action not taken: mailbox unavailable) and a 5.7.27
   enhanced status code (Permanent failure: Sender address has null MX).

4.2.  Sending Mail from Domains That Publish Null MX

   Null MX is primarily intended for domains that do not send or receive
   any mail, but have mail sent to them anyway due to mistakes or
   malice.  Many receiving systems reject mail that has an invalid
   return address.  Return addresses are needed to allow the sender to
   handle message delivery errors.  An invalid return address often
   signals that the message is spam.  Hence, mail systems SHOULD NOT
   publish a null MX record for domains that they use in
   RFC5321.MailFrom or RFC5322.From addresses.  If a system nonetheless
   does so, it risks having its mail rejected.

   Operators of domains that do not send mail can publish Sender Policy
   Framework (SPF) "-all" policies [RFC7208] to make an explicit
   declaration that the domains send no mail.

   Null MX is not intended to be a replacement for the null reverse-path
   described in Section 4.5.5 of RFC 5321 and does not change the
   meaning or use of a null reverse-path.

5.  Security Considerations

   Within the DNS, a null MX RR is an ordinary MX record and presents no
   new security issues.  If desired, it can be secured in the same
   manner as any other DNS record using DNSSEC.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added the following entries to the "Enumerated Status Codes"
   subregistry of the "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Enhanced
   Status Codes Registry".

   Code:              X.1.10
   Sample Text:       Recipient address has null MX
   Associated basic status code:  556
   Description:       This status code is returned when the associated
                      address is marked as invalid using a null MX.

   Code:              X.7.27
   Sample Text:       Sender address has null MX
   Associated basic status code:  550
   Description:       This status code is returned when the associated
                      sender address has a null MX, and the SMTP
                      receiver is configured to reject mail from such
                      sender (e.g., because it could not return a DSN).
