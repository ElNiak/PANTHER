                 SCENARIOS FOR USING ARPANET COMPUTERS

   This scenario booklet is provided to facilitate the use of ARPANET
   host computer systems via the ARPANET.  The objective of these
   scenarios is to aid a user in sampling host computers on the ARPANET,
   thereby stimulating this interest in using ARPANET.

   The scenarios describe the login procedure, the use of some simple or
   interesting facilities, and obtaining on-line help facilities such as
   on-line documentation and interactive dialog with experienced users
   via "link" or "message" type mechanisms.  The use of TELNETS for
   "piggy-back login" is included to help system programmers in
   debugging and testing their protocol implementations.  An exercise of
   editing and running a very simple program is also included, where
   appropriate.

   The scenarios assume the environment of the MIT-DMCG PDP-10 computer
   system, but are readily adaptable to use from other systems.  The
   annotated script is provided to assist you in the use of a particular
   host computer.  Comments are enclosed in parenthesis, and user input
   is underlined.  In the scripts, a carriage return is indicated by
   '<CR>', and a space by blank (i.e., no type).  Escape to local user
   TELNET is indicated by backslash, the default escape character in the
   MIT_DMCG system.  Additional blank lines have been introduced in many
   instances to improve readability of the script.

   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:  The author wishes to acknowledge the help of Bob
   Bressler, Rich Guida, Bob Metcalfe, Jim Michener, and Neal Ryan in
   preparing this Scenarios booklet.

   NOTE:  Your comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

   NIC is best used in character-at-a-time mode with remote echo.  After

   NIC (their default is half-duplex).  NIC can also be used in half-
   duplex (with local echo), line-at-a-time mode, but use is not as
   convenient.  Although NIC commands are similar to BBN TENEX, the NLS
   subsystem is different.

   TENEX is best used in character-at-a-time mode with remote echo.

   should either change your mode to FULLDUPLEX, or escape into NETWRK
   and request local echo.  At command level TENEX does not distinguish
   between upper and lower case alphabetics.  The programs "DOCTOR" and
   "LIFE" may not be available to you in the BBN PDP-10(A) system, but
   can still be used from the BBN PDP-10(B) system.

   Harvard system treats network interaction as half-duplex, character-
   at-a-time, and assumes local echo.  The prompt character is ".", and
   the escape character is <Control-C>.  No lower case text is accepted
   (hit the <BRK> key on the IMLAC if you are not in upper case mode).
