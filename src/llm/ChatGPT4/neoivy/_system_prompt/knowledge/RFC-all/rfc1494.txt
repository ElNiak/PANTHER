1.  Introduction

   This document is a companion to [1], which defines the principles
   behind interworking between MIME-based RFC-822 mail and X.400 mail.
   This document describes the content of the "IANA MHS/MIME Equivalence
   table" referenced in the companion document, and defines the initial
   configuration of this table.  Mappings for new MIME content-types
   and/or X.400 body part types should be registered with the IANA to
   minimize redundancy and promote interoperability.

   In MIME, the term "content-type" is used to refer to an information
   object contained in the body of a message.  In contrast, X.400 uses
   the term "body part type."  In this document, the term "body part" is
   used to refer to either.

   Please send comments to the MIME-MHS mailing list:
   <mime-mhs@surfnet.nl>.

2.  Equivalence Table Definition

   For each MIME content-type/X.400 body part pair, the Equivalence
   Table will contain an entry with the following sections:

   X.400 Body Part
        This section identifies the X.400 Body Part governed by this
        Table entry. It includes any OBJECT IDENTIFIERs or other
        parameters necessary to uniquely identify the Body Part.

   MIME Content-Type
        This section identifies the MIME content-type governed by this
        Table entry.  The MIME content-type named here must be
        registered with the IANA.

   Conversion Type
        This section identifies the type of conversion applied.  See the
        section on Generic Conversions for an explanation of the
        possible values.

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


   Comments (optional)
        This section gives any additional commentary that might be
        useful in understanding the mapping between the X.400 and MIME
        representations.

   The initial Equivalence Table entries in this document are described
   using this convention.  Any future submissions to the IANA should
   follow this format.

3.  Generic conversions

3.1.  Byte copy

   This is the trivial case, that is, no conversion at all.  The byte
   stream is simply copied between MIME and X.400.

   This is the preferred conversion, since it is the simplest.

   Implementors and vendors will be registering OBJECT IDENTIFIERs and
   MIME content-types for their various objects.  They are STRONGLY
   ENCOURAGED to specify their content formats such that a gateway can
   use Byte Copy to map between them.

   Note that in some cases, it is necessary to define exactly which
   ASN.1 construct to replace with the content of the MIME object.

3.2.  Text Conversion

   This type of conversion applies to text objects that cannot be mapped
   using a simple Byte Copy.  Conversion involves scanning and
   reformatting the object.  For example, the MIME and X.400 objects
   might differ in their encoding of nonstandard characters, or line or
   page breaks.

3.3.  Image Conversion

   This conversion type applies to raster images, like Group 3 Facsimile
   or JPEG.  Again, it differs from Byte Copy in that it involves
   scanning reformatting the byte stream.  It differs from Text
   Conversion in that it is pixel- oriented, rather than character-
   oriented.

3.4.  Tunneling

   This is not a conversion at all, but an encapsulation of the object.
   This is the fallback conversion, used when no explicit mapping
   applies.

5.  Newly defined X.400 Body Parts

   This section defines new X.400 Body Parts for the purposes of
   interworking with MIME.

   All new X.400 Body Parts defined here will be Extended Body Parts, as
   defined in CCITT Recommendation X.420 [2].

5.1.  Use of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs and ASN.1 MACROS

   X.420 dictates that Extended Body Parts shall:

       (1)  use OBJECT IDENTIFIERs (OIDs) to uniquely identify
            the contents, and

       (2)  be defined by using the ASN.1 Macro:

               EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE MACRO::=
               BEGIN
                  TYPE NOTATION  ::= Parameters Data
                  VALUE NOTATION ::= value (VALUE OBJECT IDENTIFIER)

                  Parameters     ::=  "PARAMETERS" type "IDENTIFIED"
                                      "BY" value(OBJECT IDENTIFIER)
                                    | empty;
                  Data           ::= "DATA" type
               END

   To meet these requirements, this document uses the OID

      mime-mhs-bodies

   defined in [1], as the root OID for X.400 Extended Body Parts defined
   for MIME interworking.

   Each Extended Body Part contains Data and optional Parameters, each
   being named by an OID.  To this end, two OID subtrees are defined
   under mime-mhs-bodies, one for Data, and the other for Parameters:

          mime-mhs-bp-data  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                          { mime-mhs-bodies 1 }
          mime-mhs-bp-parameter OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                          { mime-mhs-bodies 2 }

   All definitions of X.400 body parts submitted to the IANA for
   registration must use the Extended Body Part Type macro for the
   definition.  See the next section for an example.




Alvestrand & Thompson                                           [Page 5]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


   Lastly, the IANA will use the mime-mhs-bp-data and mime-mhs-bp-
   parameter OIDs as root OIDs for any new MIME content-type/subtypes
   that aren't otherwise registered in the Equivalence Table.

5.2.  The Generic MIME Extended Body Part

   The following X.400 Body Part is defined to carry any MIME content-
   type for which there is no explicit IANA registered mapping.

         mime-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
            PARAMETERS MimeParameters
               IDENTIFIED BY mime-generic-parameters
            DATA            OCTET STRING
            ::= mime-generic-data

         MimeParameters ::=
             SEQUENCE {
                 content-type       IA5String,
                 content-parameters SEQUENCE OF
                                    SEQUENCE {
                                        parameter          IA5String,
                                        parameter-value    IA5String
                                    }

                                    -- from RFC-1327, sec. 5.1.12
                 other-header-fields RFC822FieldList
             }

         mime-generic-parameters OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
             { mime-mhs-bp-parameter 1 }
         mime-generic-data       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
             { mime-mhs-bp-data  1 }

   To convert the MIME content-type into the X.400 mime- body-part:

       (1)  Copy the "type/subtype" string from the MIME
            Content-Type: header field into
            MimeParameters.content-type

       (2)  For each "parameter=value" string in the MIME
            Content-Type header field, create a
            MimeParameters.content-parameters structure, and copy
            the "parameter" string into MimeParameters.content-
            parameters.parameter field and the "value" string
            into the paired MimeParameters.content-
            parameters.parameter-value field.

       (3)  Convert the MIME body part into its canonical form.



Alvestrand & Thompson                                           [Page 6]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


            (See appendix H of RFC 1341 [3] for a discussion
            of canonical in this context.) Said another way,
            reverse the transfer encoding to recover the original
            byte stream.

       (4)  Copy the canonical byte stream into the mime-body-
            part.data octet string.

       (5)  Remove the Content-type and the Content-transfer-
            encoding header fields from the MIME body part's
            RFC822 header.

       (6)  Any header fields starting with "Content-" in the
            MIME body part is placed in the optional other-
            header-fields structure. Note that this can only
            occur when the MIME content-type occurs as part of a
            "multipart" content-type.

   The mapping from the X.400 mime-body-part to a MIME content-type is
   the inverse of the above steps.

5.3.  The PostScript body part

   The following Extended Body Part is defined for PostScript data
   streams.  It has no parameters.

         postscript-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE

           DATA             OCTET STRING
           ::= mime-postscript-body

         mime-postscript-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                   { mime-mhs-bp-data 2 }

5.4.  The JPEG body part

   The following Extended Body Part is defined for JPEG data streams.
   It has no parameters.

          jpeg-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
            DATA            OCTET STRING
            ::= mime-jpeg-body

          mime-jpeg-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                  { mime-mhs-bp-data 3 }

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


5.5.  The GIF body part

   The following Extended Body Part is defined for GIF data streams.  It
   has no parameters.

          gif-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
            DATA            OCTET STRING
            ::= mime-gif-body

          mime-gif-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                  { mime-mhs-bp-data 4 }

6.  Newly defined MIME content-types

   This section defines new MIME content-types for the purposes of
   interworking with X.400.

6.1.  The application/x400-bp content-type

   This content-type is defined to carry any X.400(88) body part for
   which there is no registered IANA mapping.

       The content-type field is

         application/x400-bp

       The parameters are:

             bp-type=<INTEGER or OBJECT IDENTIFIER>

   The body contains the raw ASN.1 IPM.body octet stream, including the
   initial tag octet.

   If the body is a basic body part, the bp-type parameter is set to the
   number of the body part's context-specific tag, that is, the tag of
   the IPMS.Body.BodyPart component.

   If the body is an Extended Body Part, the bp-type parameter is set to
   the OBJECT IDENTIFIER from

            IPMS.body.externally-defined.data.direct-reference

   No attempt is made to turn the parameters of Extended Body Parts into
   MIME parameters.  (This task is the responsibility of the recipient's
   UA).

   For example, a basic VideotexBodyPart will have




Alvestrand & Thompson                                           [Page 8]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


      Content-type=application/x400-bp; bp-type=6

   whilst a Extended Videotex body part will have

      Content-type=application/x400-bp; bp-type=2.6.1.4.5

   application/x400-bp will need a content-transfer-encoding of base64
   or quoted-printable when carried in 7-bit MIME.  Since there is no
   way to know beforehand the content, it is recommended to just inspect
   the first 1 KByte or so of data and choose the one that seems to
   produce the more compact encoding.

   If this is not feasible, Base64 is recommended.

6.2.  The image/g3fax content-type

   This content-type is defined to carry G3 Facsimile byte streams.

   In general, a G3Fax image contains 3 pieces of information:

       (1)  A set of flags indicating the particular coding
            scheme.  CCITT Recommendation T.30 defines how the
            flags are transmitted over telephones. In this
            medium, the flags are carried as parameters in the
            MIME content-type header field.

       (2)  A structure that divides the bits into pages.  CCITT
            recommendation T.30 describes how to define page
            boundaries.  A page break algorithm is defined here
            that is independent of how the image data is
            conveyed.

       (3)  For each page, a sequence of bits that form the
            encoding of the image.  CCITT recommendation T.4
            defines the bit image format.  This is used without
            change.

6.2.1.  G3Fax Parameters

   The following parameters are defined:

       (1)  page-length - possible values: A4, B4 and Unlimited

       (2)  page-width - possible values: A3, A4, B4

            dimensional, Uncompressed

       (4)  resolution - possible values: Fine, Coarse

       (5)  DCS - a bit string, represented in Base64.

       (6)  pages - an integer, giving the number of pages in the
            document

   If nothing is specified, the default parameter settings are:

         page-length=A4
         page-width=A4
         encoding=1-dimensional
         resolution=Coarse

   It is possible (but misleading) to view the representation of these
   values as single-bit flags. They correspond to the following bits of
   the T.30 control string and X.400 G3FacsimileParameters:

       Parameter               T.30 bit        X.400 bit

       page-length=A4             no bit set
       page-length=B4          19              21
       page-length=Unlimited   20              20

       page-width=A4              no bit set
       page-width=A3           18              22
       page-width=B4           17              23

       encoding=1-dimensional     no bit set
       encoding=2-dimensional  16              8
       encoding=Uncompressed   26              30

       resolution=Coarse          no bit set
       resolution=Fine         15              9

   The reason for the different bit numbers is that X.400 counts bits in
   an octet from the MSB down to the LSB, while T.30 uses the opposite
   numbering scheme.

   If any bit but these are set in the Device Control String, the DCS
   parameter should be supplied.

6.2.2.  Content Encoding

   X.400 defines the g3-facsimile data stream as a SEQUENCE of BIT
   STRINGs. Each BIT STRING is a page of facsimile image data, encoded
   as defined by Recommendation T.4.  The following content encoding is
   reversible between MIME and X.400 and ensures that page breaks are



Alvestrand & Thompson                                          [Page 10]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


   honored in the MIME representation.

   An EOL is defined as a bit sequence of

          000000000001 (eleven zeroes and a one).

   Each page of the message is delimited by a sequence of six (6) EOLs
   that MUST start on a byte boundary.  The image bit stream is padded
   as needed to achieve this alignment.

   Searching for the boundary is a matter of searching for the byte
   sequence (HEX) 00 10 01 00 10 01 00 10 01, which cannot occur inside
   the image.

   See Section 7.5 for the algorithm on conversion between this encoding
   and the X.400 encoding.

   The Base64 content-transfer-encoding is appropriate for carrying this
   content-type.

6.3.  The Application/ODA content-type

   The "ODA" subtype of application is used to indicate that a body
   contains information encoded according to the Office Document
   Architecture [4] standards, using the ODIF representation format.
   For application/oda, the Content- Type line should also specify an
   attribute/value pair that indicates the document application profile
   (DAP), using the key word "profile", and the document class, using
   the keyword "class".

   For the keyword "class", the values "formatted", "processable" and
   "formatted-processable" are legal values.

   Thus an appropriate header field  might look like this:

       Content-Type:  application/oda; profile=Q112;
       class=formatted

   Consult the ODA standard [4] for further information.

   The Base64 content-transfer-encoding is appropriate for carrying ODA.

7.  Equivalence Definitions

7.1.  IA5Text - text/plain

   X.400 Body Part: IA5Text
   MIME Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII



Alvestrand & Thompson                                          [Page 11]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


   Conversion Type: Byte copy
   Comments:

   When mapping from X.400 to MIME, the "repertoire" parameter is
   ignored.

   When mapping from MIME to X.400, the "repertoire" parameter is set to
   IA5 (5).

   NOTE: The MIME Content-type headers are omitted, when mapping from
   X.400 to MIME, if and only if the IA5Text body part is the only body
   part in the IPMS.Body sequence.

   NOTE: IA5Text specifies the "currency" symbol in position 2/4. This
   is converted without comment to the "dollar" symbol, since the author
   of this document has seen many documents in which the position was
   intended to indicate "dollar" while he has not yet seen one in which
   the "currency" symbol is intended.

   (For reference: The T.50 (1988) recommendation, which defines IA5,
   talks about ISO registered set number 2, while ASCII, using the
   "dollar" symbol, is ISO registered set number 6. There are no other
   differences.)

7.2.  GeneralText - text/plain (ISO-8859)

   X.400 Body Part: GeneralText; CharacterSets in
                           6,100,101,109,110,126,127,138,144,148
   MIME Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-(1-9)
   Conversion Type: Byte copy
   Comments:

   When mapping from X.400 to MIME, the character-set chosen from table
   below according to the value of Parameters.CharacterSets.

   When mapping from MIME to X.400, GeneralText is an Extended Body
   Part, hence it requires an OID.  The OID for the GeneralText body is
   defined in [5], part 8, annex D, as {2 6 1 4 11}. The OID for the
   parameters is {2 6 1 11 11}.

   The Parameters.CharacterSets is set from table below according to the
   value of "charset"

   NOTE: The GeneralText body part is defined in ISO 10021-8 [5], and
   NOT in the corresponding CCITT recommendation. Its parameters were
   heavily modified in a defect report, and will be a SET OF INTEGER
   (indicating the ISO registry numbers of all the used sets) in the
   next version of the standard.



Alvestrand & Thompson                                          [Page 12]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


   The following table lists the MIME character sets and the
   corresponding ISO registry numbers. If no correspondence is found,
   this conversion fails, and the generic body part approach is used.

   MIME charset    ISO IR numbers          Comment
   -----------------------------------------------
   ISO-8859-1      6, 100                  West European "8-bit ASCII"
   ISO-8859-2      6, 101                  East European
   ISO-8859-3      6, 109                  <regarded as obsolete>
   ISO-8859-4      6, 110                  <regarded as obsolete>
   ISO-8859-5      6, 144                  Cyrillic
   ISO-8859-6      6, 127                  Arabic
   ISO-8859-7      6, 126                  Greek
   ISO-8859-8      6, 138                  Hebrew
   ISO-8859-8      6, 148                  Other Latin-using languages

   When converting from MIME to X.400, generate the correct OIDs for use
   in the message envelope's Encoded Information Types by looking up the
   ISO IR number in the above table, and then appending it to the id-
   cs-eit-authority {1 0 10021 7 1 0} OID.

   The escape sequences to designate and invoke the relevant character
   sets in their proper positions must be added to the front of the
   GeneralText character string.

7.3.  BilaterallyDefined - application/octet-stream

   X.400 Body Part: BilaterallyDefined
   MIME Content-Type: Application/Octet-Stream (no parameters)
   Conversion Type: Byte copy
   Comments:

   When mapping from MIME to X.400, if there are parameters present in
   the Content-Type: header field, the conversion fails since the
   BilaterallyDefined Body Part does not have any corresponding ASN.1
   parameters.

   DISCUSSION: The parameters "name" "type" and "conversions" are
   advisory, but may in some cases give vital hints on the expected
   handling of the file. The parameter "conversions" is not fully
   defined, but it is expected that it will be useful, so we cannot drop
   it and expect people to be satisfied.

   The parameter "padding" changes the interpretation of the last byte
   of the data, and so cannot be deleted.

   An option is to prepend an IA5 body part that contains the parameter
   text; this will aid unmodified readers, and can probably be made



Alvestrand & Thompson                                          [Page 13]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


   reversible with suitable chicanery, but is it worth it????

   Also, use of BilaterallyDefined Body Parts is specifically deprecated
   in both 1988 and 1992 X.400.  It is retained solely for backward
   compatibility with 1984 systems. 1992 X.400 defines a File Transfer
   Body Part to solve this problem (i.e. binary file transfer through
   email). The standard and its regional profiles are not solid enough
   yet to exploit as a solution for this problem.

7.4.  ODA - application/oda

   X.400 Body Part: ODA
   MIME Content-Type: application/oda
   Conversion Type: Byte copy
   Comments:

   The ODA body part is defined in the CCITT document T.411 [6],
   appendix E, section E.2, "ODA identification in the P2 protocol of
   MHS"

   An abbreviated version of its ASN.1 definition is:

       oda-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
            PARAMETERS      OdaBodyPartParameters
            DATA            OdaData
            ::= id-et-oda

       OdaBodyPartParameters ::= SET {
            document-application-profile    [0] OBJECT IDENTIFIER
            document-architecture-class     [1] INTEGER {
                                            formatted (0)
                                            processable (1)
                                            formatted-processable(2)}}

       id-et-oda OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 2 8 1 0 1 }

   Mapping from X.400 to MIME, the following is done:

   The Parameters.document-application-profile is mapped onto the MIME
   parameter "profile" according to the table below.

       Profile         OBJECT IDENTIFIER

       Q112            { iso (1) identified-organization (3) ewos (16)
                         eg (2) oda (6) profile (0)  q112 (1) }

   The Parameters.document-architecture-class is mapped onto the MIME
   parameter "class" according to the table below



Alvestrand & Thompson                                          [Page 14]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


       String                  Integer

       formatted               formatted(0)
       processable             processable(1)
       formatted-processable   formatted-processable(2)

   NOTE: This parameter is not defined in RFC 1341.

   The body of the MIME content-type is the Data part of the ODA body
   part.

   When mapping from MIME to X.400, the following steps are done:

   The Parameters.document-application-profile and Parameters.document-
   architecture-class are set from the tables above.  If any of the
   parameters are missing, the values for Q112 and formatted-processable
   are used.

   It is an option for the gateway implementor to try to access them
   from inside the document, where they are defined as

   document-profile.document-characteristics.document-architecture-class

   document-profile.document-characteristics.document-application-profile

   Gateways are NOT required to do this, since the document-
   characteristics are optional parameters.  If a gateway does not, it
   simply uses the defaulting rules defined above.

   The OBJECT IDENTIFIERs for the document application profile and for
   ODA {2 8 0 0} must be added to the Encoded Information Types
   parameter of the message envelope.

7.5.  g3-facsimile - image/g3fax

   X.400 Body part: g3-facsimile
   MIME Content-Type: image/g3fax
   Conversion Type: nearly Byte copy
   Comments:

   The Parameters of the X.400 G3Fax body part are mapped to the
   corresponding Parameters on the MIME Image/G3Fax body part and vice
   versa.  Note that:

       (1)  If fineResolution is not specified, pixels will be
            twice as tall as they are wide

       (2)  If any bit not corresponding to a specially named



Alvestrand & Thompson                                          [Page 15]

RFC 1494              X.400/MIME Body Equivalences           August 1993


            option is set in the G3Fax NonBasicParameters, the
            "DCS" parameter must be used.

       (3)  Interworking is not guaranteed if any bit apart from
            those specially named are used in the
            NonBasicParameters

   From X.400 to G3Fax, the body is created in the following way:

       (1)  Any trailing EOL markers on each bitstring is
            removed. The bistring is padded to a byte boundary.

       (2)  6 consecutive EOL markers are appended to each
            bitstring.

       (3)  The padded bitstrings are concatenated together

   An EOL marker is the bit sequence 000000000001 (11 zeroes and a one).

   From G3Fax to X.400, the body is created in the following way:

       (1)  The body is split into bitstrings at each occurrence
            of 6 consecutive EOL markers, and trailing EOLs and
            padding are removed

       (2)  Each bitstring is made into an ASN.1 BITSTRING

       (3)  The bitstrings are made into an ASN.1 SEQUENCE, which
            forms the body of the G3Fax body part.

7.6.  application/postscript - postscript-body-part

   X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID postscript-body-part
