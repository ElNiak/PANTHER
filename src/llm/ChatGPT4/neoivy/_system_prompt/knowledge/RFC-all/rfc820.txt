                            ASSIGNED NUMBERS




This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently
assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol
implementations.  This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case
current information can be obtained from Jon Postel.  The assignment of
numbers is also handled by Jon, subject to the agreement between
DARPA/IPTO and DDN/PMO about number allocation, documented in Appendix A
of this RFC.  If you are developing a protocol or application that will
require the use of a link, socket, port, protocol, or network number
please contact Jon to receive a number assignment.

   ARPANET mail: POSTEL@ISIF

The ARPANET community is making the transition form the ARPANET to the
ARPA Internet.  This has been characterized as the NCP/TCP transition
[63], although many other the protocols are involved, too.  The working
documents for the new Internet environment have been collected by the
Network Information Center (NIC) in a book entitled the "Internet
Protocol Transition Workbook" [62].

Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of
notes.  The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the
"Internet Protocol Transition Workbook" or in the old "Protocol
Handbook" [17] prepared by the NIC.  Some of the items listed are
undocumented.

In all cases the name and mailbox of the responsible individual is
indicated.  In the lists that follow, a bracketed entry, e.g., [17,iii],
at the right hand margin of the page indicates a reference for the
listed protocol, where the number cites the document and the "iii" cites
the person.

RFC 820                                                     January 1983

Network Numbers


                        ASSIGNED NETWORK NUMBERS

   The network numbers listed here are used as internet addresses by the
   Internet Protocol (IP) [33,62].  The IP uses a 32-bit address field
   and divides that address into a network part and a "rest" or local
   address part.  The division takes 3 forms or classes.

      The first type of address, or class A, has a 7-bit network number
      and a 24-bit local address.  The highest-order bit is set to 0.
      This allows 128 class A networks.

                           1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                             Class A Address

      The second type of address, class B, has a 14-bit network number
      and a 16-bit local address.  The two highest-order bits are set to
      1-0.  This allows 16,384 class B networks.

                           1                   2                   3

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                             Class B Address

      The third type of address, class C, has a 21-bit network number
      and a 8-bit local address.  The three highest-order bits are set
      to 1-0-0.  This allows 2,097,152 class C networks.

                             Class C Address

   One commonly used notation for internet host addresses divides the
   32-bit address into four 8-bit fields and specifies the value of each
   field as a decimal number with the fields separated by periods.  This
   is called the "dotted decimal" notation.  For example, the internet
   address of ISIF in dotted decimal is 010.002.000.052, or 10.2.0.52.

RFC 820                                                     January 1983
                                                        Assigned Numbers
Network Numbers


   The dotted decimal notation will be used in the listing of assigned
   network numbers.  The class A networks will have nnn.rrr.rrr.rrr, the
   class B networks will have nnn.nnn.rrr.rrr, and the class C networks
   will have nnn.nnn.nnn.rrr, where nnn represents part or all of a
   network number and rrr represents part or all of a local address or
   rest field.

   For various reasons, the assigned numbers of networks are sometimes
   changed.  To ease the transition the old number will be listed as
   well.  These "old number" entries will be marked with a "T" following
   the number and preceeding the name.

   To reflect the allocation of network identifiers among various
   categories (see Appendix A), a one-character code is placed to the
   left of the network number (in the column marked by an asterisk): R
   for Research and Development, D for DoD, and C for Commercial.

                         ASSIGNED PORT NUMBERS

   Ports are used in the TCP [34,62] to name the ends of logical
   connections which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of
   providing services to unknown callers a service contact port is
   defined.  This list specifies the port used by the server process as
   its contact port.  The contact port is sometimes called the
   "well-known port".

   To the extent possible these same port assignments are used with
   UDP [42,62].

   The assigned ports use a small portion of the possible port numbers.
   The assigned ports have all except the low order eight bits cleared
   to zero.  The low order eight bits are specified here.

   Port Assignments:

                   ASSIGNED AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM NUMBERS

   The Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [66] specifies that groups of
   gateways may for autonomous systems.  The EGP provides a 16-bit field
   for identifying such systems.  The values of this field are
   registered here.

                     ASSIGNED ARPANET LINK NUMBERS

   The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET
   Host/IMP interface leader.  The link was originally defined as an 8
   bit field.  Some time after the ARPANET Host-to-Host (AHHP) protocol
   was defined and, by now some years ago, the definition of this field
   was changed to "Message-ID" and the length to 12 bits. The name link
   now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message-id field.
   The low order 4 bits of the message-id field are to be zero unless
   specifically specified otherwise for the particular protocol used on
   that link.  The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN report 1822 [1].

   Many of the networks of all classes are Ethernets (10Mb) or
   Experimental Ethernets (3Mb).  These systems use a message "type"
   field in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link" field.

                               APPENDIX A
                               ----------

   This appendix summarizes the agreements reached by the DDN/PMO and
   DARPA at a September 1982 meeting concerning the allocation and
   assignment of the various numbers associated with DoD Protocol
   Standards and the DARPA Experimental Standards.

   Recommended policy is summarized for each type of number assignment
   of concern:

      Network Identifiers used by the Internet Protocol

         It is recommended that the available number spaces for class A,
         B, and C network addresses be allocated among R&D, DoD and
         commercial uses, and that assignments of these addresses be the
         responsibility respectively of DARPA, DCA PCCO/DDN and the
         National Bureau of Standards.  The recommended allocations are
         given below.

         Class A

            R&D allocation:          8 nets    assigned by:  ARPA
            DoD allocation:         24 nets    assigned by:  TBD
            Commercial allocation:  94 nets    assigned by:  TBD
            Reserved Addresses:  0,127

         Class B

            R&D allocation:          1024 nets    assigned by:  ARPA
            DoD allocation:          3072 nets    assigned by:  TBD
            Commercial allocation:  12286 nets    assigned by:  TBD
            Reserved Addresses:  0,16383

         Class C

            R&D allocation:           65536 nets    assigned by:  ARPA
            DoD allocation:          458725 nets    assigned by:  TBD
            Commercial allocation:  1572862 nets    assigned by:  TBD
            Reserved Addresses:  0,2097151

         Class D

            All addresses in this class are reserved for future use,
            possibly in support of multicast services.  They should be
            allocated to R&D use for the present.

RFC 820                                                     January 1983
                                                        Assigned Numbers
APPENDIX A


         Within the R&D community, it will be the policy that network
         identifiers will only be granted to applicants who show
         evidence that they are acquiring standard Bolt Beranek and
         Newman gateway software or have implemented or are acquiring a
         gateway meeting the External Gateway Protocol requirements.
         Acquisition of the Berkeley BSD 4.2 UNIX software might be
         considered evidence of the latter.

         Experimental networks which later become operational need not
         be renumbered if that would cause hardships.  Rather, the
         identifiers could be moved from R&D to DoD or Commercial
         status.  Thus, network identifiers may change state among R&D,
         DoD and commercial, but the number of identifiers allocated to
         each use should remain constant.  To make possible this fluid
         assignment, it is recommended that the network identifier
         spaces not be allocated by simple partition but rather by
         specific assignment.  It is recommended that DDN/PMO or its
         designee keep track of the assignments made by DARPA, DDN and
         NBS to ensure that allocation remains as suggested.

      Protocol Identifiers

         In general, all assignments will be made by the R&D community,
         but any numbers which become R&D, DoD, national or
         international standards will be marked as such in this RFC.

         Protocol identifiers 0 and 255 are reserved.

         95 protocol identifiers are allocated for assignment to DoD
         standards, 32 for R&D use, and 127 for Commercial, national or
         international standards.

      Port Numbers

         A recommendation for allocation and assignment of port numbers
         is to be developed jointly by representatives of the ICCB and
         PSTP.

      ARPANET Link Numbers

         All unnecessary link number usage will be eliminated by joint
         effort of the ICCB, PSTP and BBN.  BBN will give consideration
         to the use of link numbers to promote interoperability among
         various ARPANET interfaces and report to the ICCB, PSTP and
         DDN/PMO.  Examples of possible interoperability issues are:

                                                        Assigned Numbers
APPENDIX A


            (i)   interoperability of 1822 and X.25 interfaces

            (ii)  interoperability of SIP and other interfaces

            (iii) logical addressing or other special services

      IP Version Numbers

         These numbers will be assigned only by the R&D community for
         the purpose of exploring alternatives in internet protocol
         service expansion, such as inclusion of stream protocol (ST)
         services.

      TCP, IP and Telnet Option Identifiers

         These numbers will be assigned by the R&D community.  Any
         permanent or experimental assignments will be identified in the
         documents specifying those protcols.

   Implementation:

      This policy recommendation has not been fully implemented as yet.
      Currently Jon Postel is acting coordinator for all number
      assignments.
