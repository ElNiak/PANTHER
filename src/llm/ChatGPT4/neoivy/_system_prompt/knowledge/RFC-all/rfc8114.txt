        Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over
                       an IPv6 Multicast Network

Abstract

   This document specifies a solution for the delivery of IPv4 multicast
   services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.  The
   solution relies upon a stateless IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation scheme
   and uses an IPv6 multicast distribution tree to deliver IPv4
   multicast traffic.  The solution is particularly useful for the
   delivery of multicast service offerings to customers serviced by
   Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite).

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


1.  Introduction

   DS-Lite [RFC6333] is an IPv4 address-sharing technique that enables
   operators to multiplex public IPv4 addresses while provisioning only
   IPv6 to users.  A typical DS-Lite scenario is the delivery of an IPv4
   service to an IPv4 user over an IPv6 network (denoted as a 4-6-4
   scenario).  [RFC6333] covers unicast services exclusively.

   This document specifies a generic solution for the delivery of IPv4
   multicast services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.
   The solution was developed with DS-Lite in mind (see more discussion
   below).  However, the solution is not limited to DS-Lite; it can also
   be applied in other deployment contexts, such as the ones described
   in [RFC7596] and [RFC7597].

   If customers have to access IPv4 multicast-based services through a
   DS-Lite environment, Address Family Transition Router (AFTR) devices
   will have to process all the Internet Group Management Protocol
   (IGMP) Report messages [RFC2236] [RFC3376] that have been forwarded
   by the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) into the IPv4-in-IPv6
   tunnels.  From that standpoint, AFTR devices are likely to behave as
   a replication point for downstream multicast traffic, and the
   multicast packets will be replicated for each tunnel endpoint that
   IPv4 receivers are connected to.

   This kind of DS-Lite environment raises two major issues:

   1.  The IPv6 network loses the benefits of efficient multicast
       traffic forwarding because it is unable to deterministically
       replicate the data as close to the receivers as possible.  As a
       consequence, the downstream bandwidth in the IPv6 network will be
       vastly consumed by sending multicast data over a unicast
       infrastructure.

   2.  The AFTR is responsible for replicating multicast traffic and
       forwarding it into each tunnel endpoint connecting IPv4 receivers
       that have explicitly asked for the corresponding content.  This
       process may significantly consume the AFTR's resources and
       overload the AFTR.

   This document specifies an extension to the DS-Lite model to deliver
   IPv4 multicast services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast-
   enabled network.

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


   This document describes a stateless translation mechanism that
   supports either Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) or Any-Source
   Multicast (ASM) operation.  The recommendation in Section 1 of
   [RFC4607] is that multicast services use SSM where possible; the
   operation of the translation mechanism is also simplified when SSM is
   used, e.g., considerations for placement of the IPv6 Rendezvous Point
   (RP) are no longer relevant.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document makes use of the following terms:

   IPv4-embedded IPv6 address:  an IPv6 address that embeds a 32-bit-
      encoded IPv4 address.  An IPv4-embedded IPv6 address can be
      unicast or multicast.

   mPrefix64:  a dedicated multicast IPv6 prefix for constructing
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses. mPrefix64 can be of two
      types: ASM_mPrefix64 used in Any-Source Multicast (ASM) mode or
      SSM_mPrefix64 used in Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) mode
      [RFC4607].  The size of this prefix is /96.

         Note: "64" is used as an abbreviation for IPv6-IPv4
         interconnection.

   uPrefix64:  a dedicated IPv6 unicast prefix for constructing
      IPv4-embedded IPv6 unicast addresses [RFC6052].  This prefix may
      be either the Well-Known Prefix (i.e., 64:ff9b::/96) or a Network-
      Specific Prefix (NSP).

   Multicast AFTR (mAFTR):  a functional entity that supports an
      IPv4-IPv6 multicast interworking function (refer to Figure 3).  It
      receives and encapsulates the IPv4 multicast packets into IPv4-in-
      IPv6 packets.  Also, it behaves as the corresponding IPv6
      multicast source for the encapsulated IPv4-in-IPv6 packets.

   Multicast Basic Bridging BroadBand (mB4):  a functional entity that
      supports an IGMP-MLD Interworking function (refer to Section 6.1)
      that translates the IGMP messages into the corresponding Multicast
      Listener Discovery (MLD) messages and sends the MLD messages to
      the IPv6 network.  In addition, the mB4 decapsulates IPv4-in-IPv6
      multicast packets.

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


   PIMv4:  refers to Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) when deployed
      in an IPv4 infrastructure (i.e., IPv4 transport capabilities are
      used to exchange PIM messages).

   PIMv6:  refers to PIM when deployed in an IPv6 infrastructure (i.e.,
      IPv6 transport capabilities are used to exchange PIM messages).

   Host portion of the MLD protocol:  refers to the part of MLD that
      applies to all multicast address listeners (Section 6 of
      [RFC3810]).  As a reminder, MLD specifies separate behaviors for
      multicast address listeners (i.e., hosts or routers that listen to
      multicast packets) and multicast routers.

   Router portion of IGMP:  refers to the part of IGMP that is performed
      by multicast routers (Section 6 of [RFC3376]).

   DR:  refers to the Designated Router as defined in [RFC7761].

3.  Scope

   This document focuses only on the subscription to IPv4 multicast
   groups and the delivery of IPv4-formatted content to IPv4 receivers
   over an IPv6-only network.  In particular, only the following case is
   covered:

      IPv4 receivers access IPv4 multicast content over IPv6-only
      multicast-enabled networks.

   This document does not cover the source/receiver heuristics, where
   IPv4 receivers can also behave as IPv4 multicast sources.  This
   document assumes that hosts behind the mB4 are IPv4 multicast
   receivers only.  Also, the document covers the host built-in mB4
   function.

4.  Solution Overview

   In the DS-Lite specification [RFC6333], an IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel is
   used to carry bidirectional IPv4 unicast traffic between a B4 and an
   AFTR.  The solution specified in this document provides an IPv4-in-
   IPv6 encapsulation scheme to deliver unidirectional IPv4 multicast
   traffic from an mAFTR to an mB4.

   An overview of the solution is provided in this section; it is
   intended as an introduction to how it works but is not normative.
   For the normative specifications of the two new functional elements,
   mB4 and mAFTR (Figure 1), refer to Sections 6 and 7.

4.1.  IPv4-Embedded IPv6 Prefixes

   In order to map the addresses of IPv4 multicast traffic with IPv6
   multicast addresses, an IPv6 multicast prefix (mPrefix64) and an IPv6
   unicast prefix (uPrefix64) are provided to the mAFTR and the mB4
   elements, both of which contribute to the computation and the
   maintenance of the IPv6 multicast distribution tree that extends the
   IPv4 multicast distribution tree into the IPv6 multicast network.
   The IPv4/IPv6 address mapping is stateless.

   The mAFTR and the mB4 use mPrefix64 to convert an IPv4 multicast
   address (G4) into an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address (G6).  The
   mAFTR and the mB4 use uPrefix64 to convert an IPv4 source address
   (S4) into an IPv4-embedded IPv6 address (S6).  The mAFTR and the mB4
   must use the same mPrefix64 and uPrefix64; they also run the same
   algorithm for building IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.  Refer to
   Section 5 for more details about the address mapping.

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


4.2.  Multicast Distribution Tree Computation

   When an IPv4 receiver connected to the device that embeds the mB4
   capability wants to subscribe to an IPv4 multicast group, it sends an
   IGMP Report message towards the mB4.  The mB4 creates the IPv6
   multicast group (G6) address using mPrefix64 and the original IPv4
   multicast group address.  If the receiver sends a source-specific
   IGMPv3 Report message, the mB4 will create the IPv6 source address
   (S6) using uPrefix64 and the original IPv4 source address.

   The mB4 uses the G6 (and both S6 and G6 in SSM) to create the
   corresponding MLD Report message.  The mB4 sends the Report message
   towards the IPv6 network.  The PIMv6 DR receives the MLD Report
   message and sends the PIMv6 Join message to join the IPv6 multicast
   distribution tree.  It can send either PIMv6 Join (*,G6) in ASM or
   PIMv6 Join (S6,G6) in SSM to the mAFTR.

   The mAFTR acts as the IPv6 DR to which the uPrefix64-derived S6 is
   connected.  The mAFTR will receive the source-specific PIMv6 Join
   message (S6,G6) from the IPv6 multicast network.  If the mAFTR is the
   Rendezvous Point (RP) of G6, it will receive the any-source PIMv6
   Join message (*,G6) from the IPv6 multicast network.  If the mAFTR is
   not the RP of G6, it will send the PIM Register message to the RP of
   G6 located in the IPv6 multicast network.  For the sake of
   simplicity, it is recommended to configure the mAFTR as the RP for
   the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast groups it manages; no registration
   procedure is required under this configuration.

   When the mAFTR receives the PIMv6 Join message (*,G6), it will
   extract the IPv4 multicast group address (G4).  If the mAFTR is the
   RP of G4 in the IPv4 multicast network, it will create a (*,G4) entry
   (if such entry does not already exist) in its own IPv4 multicast
   routing table.  If the mAFTR is not the RP of G4, it will send the
   corresponding PIMv4 Join message (*,G4) towards the RP of G4 in the
   IPv4 multicast network.

   When the mAFTR receives the PIMv6 Join message (S6,G6), it will
   extract the IPv4 multicast group address (G4) and IPv4 source address
   (S4) and send the corresponding (S4,G4) PIMv4 Join message directly
   to the IPv4 source.

   A branch of the multicast distribution tree is thus constructed,
   comprising both an IPv4 part (from the mAFTR upstream) and an IPv6
   part (from mAFTR downstream towards the mB4).

   The mAFTR advertises the route of uPrefix64 with an IPv6 Interior
   Gateway Protocol (IGP), so as to represent the IPv4-embedded IPv6
   source in the IPv6 multicast network and to allow IPv6 routers to run

   the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check procedure on incoming
   multicast traffic.  Injecting internal /96 routes is not problematic
   given the recommendation in [RFC7608] that requires that forwarding
   processes must be designed to process prefixes of any length up to
   /128.

4.3.  Multicast Data Forwarding

   When the mAFTR receives an IPv4 multicast packet, it will encapsulate
   the packet into an IPv6 multicast packet using the IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address as the destination address and an IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 unicast address as the source address.  The encapsulated IPv6
   multicast packet will be forwarded down the IPv6 multicast
   distribution tree, and the mB4 will eventually receive the packet.

   The IPv6 multicast network treats the IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulated
   multicast packets as native IPv6 multicast packets.  The IPv6
   multicast routers use the outer IPv6 header to make their forwarding
   decisions.

   When the mB4 receives the IPv6 multicast packet (to G6) derived by
   mPrefix64, it decapsulates it and forwards the original IPv4
   multicast packet towards the receivers subscribing to G4.

   Note: At this point, only IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation is defined;
   however, other types of encapsulation could be defined in the future.

5.  IPv4/IPv6 Address Mapping

5.1.  Prefix Assignment

   A dedicated IPv6 multicast prefix (mPrefix64) is provisioned to the
   mAFTR and the mB4.  The mAFTR and the mB4 use the mPrefix64 to form
   an IPv6 multicast group address from an IPv4 multicast group address.
   The mPrefix64 can be of two types: ASM_mPrefix64 (an mPrefix64 used
   in ASM mode) or SSM_mPrefix64 (an mPrefix64 used in SSM mode).  The
   mPrefix64 MUST be derived from the corresponding IPv6 multicast
   address space (e.g., the SSM_mPrefix64 must be in the range of the
   multicast address space specified in [RFC4607]).

   The IPv6 part of the multicast distribution tree can be seen as an
   extension of the IPv4 part of the multicast distribution tree.  The
   IPv4 source address MUST be mapped to an IPv6 source address.  An
   IPv6 unicast prefix (uPrefix64) is provisioned to the mAFTR and the
   mB4.  The mAFTR and the mB4 use the uPrefix64 to form an IPv6 source
   address from an IPv4 source address as specified in [RFC6052].  The

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


   uPrefix-formed IPv6 source address will represent the original IPv4
   source in the IPv6 multicast network.  The uPrefix64 MUST be derived
   from the IPv6 unicast address space.

   The multicast address translation MUST follow the algorithm defined
   in Section 5.2.

   The mPrefix64 and uPrefix64 can be configured in the mB4 using a
   variety of methods, including an out-of-band mechanism, manual
   configuration, or a dedicated provisioning protocol (e.g., using
   DHCPv6 [RFC8115]).

   The stateless translation mechanism described in Section 5 does not
   preclude use of Embedded-RP [RFC3956] [RFC7371].

5.2.  Multicast Address Translation Algorithm

   IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast addresses are composed according to the
   following algorithm:

   o  Concatenate the 96 bits of the mPrefix64 and the 32 bits of the
      IPv4 address to obtain a 128-bit address.

   The IPv4 multicast addresses are extracted from the IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 multicast addresses according to the following algorithm:

   o  If the multicast address has a pre-configured mPrefix64, extract
      the last 32 bits of the IPv6 multicast address.

   An IPv4 source is represented in the IPv6 realm with its
   IPv4-converted IPv6 address [RFC6052].

5.3.  Textual Representation

   The embedded IPv4 address in an IPv6 multicast address is included in
   the last 32 bits; therefore, dotted decimal notation can be used.

5.4.  Examples

    Group address mapping example:

    +---------------------+--------------+----------------------------+
    |      mPrefix64      | IPv4 address | IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address |
    +---------------------+--------------+----------------------------+
    |  ff0x::db8:0:0/96   |  233.252.0.1 |   ff0x::db8:233.252.0.1    |

    Source address mapping example when a /96 is used:

    +---------------------+--------------+----------------------------+

   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses used in this example are derived from the
   IPv4 and IPv6 blocks reserved for documentation, as per [RFC6676].
   The unicast IPv4 address of the above example is derived from the
   documentation address block defined in [RFC6890].

6.  Multicast B4 (mB4)

6.1.  IGMP-MLD Interworking Function

   The IGMP-MLD Interworking function combines the IGMP/MLD Proxying
   function and the address-synthesizing operations.  The IGMP/MLD
   Proxying function is specified in [RFC4605].  The address translation
   is stateless and MUST follow the address mapping specified in
   Section 5.

   The mB4 performs the host portion of the MLD protocol on the upstream
   interface.  The composition of IPv6 membership in this context is
   constructed through address-synthesizing operations and MUST
   synchronize with the membership database maintained in the IGMP
   domain.  MLD messages are sent natively to the direct-connected IPv6
   multicast routers (they will be processed by the PIM DR).  The mB4
   also performs the router portion of IGMP on the downstream
   interface(s).  Refer to [RFC4605] for more details.

            +----------+   IGMP  +-------+   MLD   +---------+
            |   IPv4   |---------|  mB4  |---------|   PIM   |
            | Receiver |         |       |         |    DR   |
            +----------+         +-------+         +---------+

                      Figure 2: IGMP-MLD Interworking

   If SSM is deployed, the mB4 MUST construct the IPv6 source address
   (or retrieve the IPv4 source address) using the uPrefix64.  The mB4
   MAY create a membership database that associates the IPv4-IPv6
   multicast groups with the interfaces (e.g., WLAN and Wired Ethernet)
   facing IPv4 multicast receivers.

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


6.2.  Multicast Data Forwarding

   When the mB4 receives an IPv6 multicast packet, it MUST check the
   group address and the source address.  If the IPv6 multicast group
   prefix is mPrefix64 and the IPv6 source prefix is uPrefix64, the mB4
   MUST decapsulate the IPv6 header [RFC2473]; the decapsulated IPv4
   multicast packet will be forwarded through each relevant interface
   following standard IPv4 multicast forwarding procedures.  Otherwise,
   the mB4 MUST silently drop the packet.

   As an illustration, if a packet is received from source
   2001:db8::192.0.2.33 and needs to be forwarded to group
   ff3x:20:2001:db8::233.252.0.1, the mB4 decapsulates it into an IPv4
   multicast packet using 192.0.2.33 as the IPv4 source address and
   using 233.252.0.1 as the IPv4 destination multicast group.  This
   example assumes that the mB4 is provisioned with uPrefix64
   (2001:db8::/96) and mPrefix64 (ff3x:20:2001:db8::/96).

6.3.  Fragmentation

   Encapsulating IPv4 multicast packets into IPv6 multicast packets that
   will be forwarded by the mAFTR towards the mB4 along the IPv6
   multicast distribution tree reduces the effective MTU size by the
   size of an IPv6 header.  In this specification, the data flow is
   unidirectional from the mAFTR to the mB4.  The mAFTR MUST fragment
   the oversized IPv6 packet after the encapsulation into two IPv6
   packets.  The mB4 MUST reassemble the IPv6 packets, decapsulate the
   IPv6 header, and forward the IPv4 packet to the hosts that have
   subscribed to the corresponding multicast group.  Further
   considerations about fragmentation issues are documented in Sections
   5.3 and 6.3 of [RFC6333].

6.4.  Host Built-In mB4 Function

   If the mB4 function is implemented in the host that is directly
   connected to an IPv6-only network, the host MUST implement the
   behaviors specified in Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3.  The host MAY
   optimize the implementation to provide an Application Programming
   Interface (API) or kernel module to skip the IGMP-MLD Interworking
   function.  Optimization considerations are out of scope of this
   specification.

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


6.5.  Preserve the Scope

   When several mPrefix64s are available, if each enclosed IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 multicast prefix has a distinct scope, the mB4 MUST select the
   appropriate IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast prefix whose scope matches
   the IPv4 multicast address used to synthesize an IPv4-embedded IPv6
   multicast address (specific mappings are listed in Section 8 of
   [RFC2365]).  Mapping is achieved such that the scope of the selected
   IPv6 multicast prefix does not exceed the original IPv4 multicast
   scope.  If the mB4 is instructed to preserve the scope but no IPv6
   multicast prefix that matches the IPv4 multicast scope is found, IPv6
   multicast address mapping SHOULD fail.

   The mB4 MAY be configured to not preserve the scope when enforcing
   the address translation algorithm.

   Consider that an mB4 is configured with two mPrefix64s,
   ff0e::db8:0:0/96 (global scope) and ff08::db8:0:0/96 (organization
   scope).  If the mB4 receives an IGMP Report message from an IPv4
   receiver to subscribe to 233.252.0.1, it checks which mPrefix64 to
   use in order to preserve the scope of the requested IPv4 multicast
   group.  In this example, given that 233.252.0.1 is intended for
   global use, the mB4 creates the IPv6 multicast group (G6) address
   using ff0e::db8:0:0/96 and the original IPv4 multicast group address
   (233.252.0.1): ff0e::db8:233.252.0.1.

7.  Multicast AFTR (mAFTR)

7.1.  Routing Considerations

   The mAFTR is responsible for interconnecting the IPv4 multicast
   distribution tree with the corresponding IPv6 multicast distribution
   tree.  The mAFTR MUST use the uPrefix64 to build the IPv6 source
   addresses of the multicast group address derived from mPrefix64.  In
   other words, the mAFTR MUST be the multicast source whose address is
   derived from uPrefix64.

   The mAFTR MUST advertise the route towards uPrefix64 with the IPv6
   IGP.  This is needed by the IPv6 multicast routers so that they
   acquire the routing information to discover the source.

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


7.2.  Processing PIM Messages

   The mAFTR MUST interwork PIM Join/Prune messages for (*,G6) and
   (S6,G6) on their corresponding (*,G4) and (S4,G4).  The following
   text specifies the expected behavior of the mAFTR for PIM Join
   messages.

                                +---------+
                       ---------|  mAFTR  |---------
                         PIMv6  |uPrefix64|  PIMv4
                                |mPrefix64|
                                +---------+

                Figure 3: PIMv6-PIMv4 Interworking Function

   The mAFTR contains two separate Tree Information Bases (TIBs): the
   IPv4 Tree Information Base (TIB4) and the IPv6 Tree Information Base
   (TIB6), which are bridged by one IPv4-in-IPv6 virtual interface.  It
   should be noted that TIB implementations may vary (e.g., some may
   rely upon a single integrated TIB without any virtual interface), but
   they should follow this specification for the sake of global and
   functional consistency.

   When an mAFTR receives a PIMv6 Join message (*,G6) with an IPv6
   multicast group address (G6) that is derived from the mPrefix64, it
   MUST check its IPv6 Tree Information Base (TIB6).  If there is an
   entry for this G6 address, it MUST check whether the interface
   through which the PIMv6 Join message has been received is in the
   outgoing interface (oif) list.  If not, the mAFTR MUST add the
   interface to the oif list.  If there is no entry in the TIB6, the
   mAFTR MUST create a new entry (*,G6) for the multicast group.
   Whether or not the IPv4-in-IPv6 virtual interface is set as the
   incoming interface of the newly created entry is up to the
   implementation, but it should comply with the mAFTR's multicast data
   forwarding behavior (see Section 7.4).

   The mAFTR MUST extract the IPv4 multicast group address (G4) from the
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address (G6) contained in the PIMv6 Join
   message.  The mAFTR MUST check its IPv4 Tree Information Base (TIB4).
   If there is an entry for G4, it MUST check whether the IPv4-in-IPv6
   virtual interface is in the outgoing interface list.  If not, the
   mAFTR MUST add the interface to the oif list.  If there is no entry
   for G4, the mAFTR MUST create a new (*,G4) entry in its TIB4 and
   initiate the procedure for building the shared tree in the IPv4
   multicast network without any additional requirement.






Boucadair, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 14]

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


   If the mAFTR receives a source-specific Join message, the (S6,G6) is
   processed rather than (*,G6).  The procedures of processing (S6,G6)
   and (*,G6) are almost the same.  Differences have been detailed in
   [RFC7761].

7.3.  Switching from Shared Tree to Shortest Path Tree

   When the mAFTR receives the first IPv4 multicast packet, it may
   extract the source address (S4) from the packet and send an Explicit
   PIMv4 (S4,G4) Join message directly to S4.  The mAFTR switches from
   the shared Rendezvous Point Tree (RPT) to the Shortest Path Tree
   (SPT) for G4.

   For IPv6 multicast routers to switch to the SPT, there is no new
   requirement.  IPv6 multicast routers may send an Explicit PIMv6 Join
   to the mAFTR once the first (S6,G6) multicast packet arrives from
   upstream multicast routers.

7.4.  Multicast Data Forwarding

   When the mAFTR receives an IPv4 multicast packet, it checks its TIB4
   to find a matching entry and then forwards the packet to the
   interface(s) listed in the outgoing interface list.  If the IPv4-in-
   IPv6 virtual interface also belongs to this list, the packet is
   encapsulated with the mPrefix64-derived and uPrefix64-derived
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses to form an IPv6 multicast packet
   [RFC2473].  Then another lookup is made by the mAFTR to find a
   matching entry in the TIB6.  Whether or not the RPF check for the
   second lookup is performed is up to the implementation and is out of
   the scope of this document.  The IPv6 multicast packet is then
   forwarded along the IPv6 multicast distribution tree, based upon the
   outgoing interface list of the matching entry in the TIB6.

   As an illustration, if a packet is received from source 192.0.2.33
   and needs to be forwarded to group 233.252.0.1, the mAFTR
   encapsulates it into an IPv6 multicast packet using
   ff3x:20:2001:db8::233.252.0.1 as the IPv6 destination multicast group
   and using 2001:db8::192.0.2.33 as the IPv6 source address.

7.5.  Scope

   The Scope field of IPv4-in-IPv6 multicast addresses should be valued
   accordingly (e.g., to "E" for global scope) in the deployment
   environment.  This specification does not discuss the scope value
   that should be used.

   The considerations in Section 6.5 are to be followed by the mAFTR.

8.  Deployment Considerations

8.1.  Other Operational Modes

8.1.1.  The IPv6 DR is Co-located with the mAFTR

   The mAFTR can embed the MLD Querier function (as well as the PIMv6
   DR) for optimization purposes.  When the mB4 sends an MLD Report
   message to this mAFTR, the mAFTR should process the MLD Report
   message that contains the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast group address
   and then send the corresponding PIMv4 Join message (Figure 4).

                                +---------+
                       ---------|  mAFTR  |---------
                          MLD   |uPrefix64|  PIMv4
                                |mPrefix64|
                                +---------+

                 Figure 4: MLD-PIMv4 Interworking Function

   Discussions about the location of the mAFTR capability and related
   ASM or SSM multicast design considerations are out of the scope of
   this document.

8.1.2.  The IPv4 DR is Co-located with the mAFTR

   If the mAFTR is co-located with the IPv4 DR connected to the original
   IPv4 source, it may simply use the uPrefix64 and mPrefix64 prefixes
   to build the IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast packets, and the sending of
   PIMv4 Join messages becomes unnecessary.

8.2.  Load Balancing

   For robustness and load distribution purposes, several nodes in the
   network can embed the mAFTR function.  In such case, the same IPv6
   prefixes (i.e., mPrefix64 and uPrefix64) and algorithm to build
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses must be configured on those nodes.

8.3.  mAFTR Policy Configuration

   The mAFTR may be configured with a list of IPv4 multicast groups and
   sources.  Only multicast flows bound to the configured addresses
   should be handled by the mAFTR.  Otherwise, packets are silently
   dropped.

RFC 8114                IPv4 over IPv6 Multicast              March 2017


8.4.  Static vs. Dynamic PIM Triggering

   To optimize the usage of network resources in current deployments,
   all multicast streams are conveyed in the core network while only the
   most popular ones are forwarded in the aggregation/access networks
   (static mode).  Less popular streams are forwarded in the access
   network upon request (dynamic mode).  Depending on the location of
   the mAFTR in the network, two modes can be envisaged: static and
   dynamic.

   Static Mode:  The mAFTR is configured to instantiate permanent
      (S6,G6) and (*,G6) entries in its TIB6 using a pre-configured
      (S4,G4) list.

   Dynamic Mode:  The instantiation or withdrawal of (S6,G6) or (*,G6)
      entries is triggered by the receipt of PIMv6 messages.

9.  Security Considerations

   Besides multicast scoping considerations (see Sections 6.5 and 7.5),
   this document does not introduce any new security concerns in
   addition to those discussed in Section 5 of [RFC6052], Section 10 of
   [RFC3810], and Section 6 of [RFC7761].

   Unlike solutions that map IPv4 multicast flows to IPv6 unicast flows,
   this document does not exacerbate Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

   An mB4 SHOULD be provided with appropriate configuration information
   to preserve the scope of a multicast message when mapping an IPv4
   multicast address into an IPv4-embedded IPv6 multicast address and
   vice versa.

9.1.  Firewall Configuration

   The CPE that embeds the mB4 function SHOULD be configured to accept
   incoming MLD messages and traffic forwarded to multicast groups
   subscribed to by receivers located in the customer premises.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Use Case: IPTV

   IPTV generally includes two categories of service offerings:

   o  Video on Demand (VoD) that streams unicast video content to
      receivers.

   o  Multicast live TV broadcast services.

   Two types of provider are involved in the delivery of this service:

   o  Content Providers, who usually own the content that is multicast
      to receivers.  Content providers may contractually define an
      agreement with network providers to deliver content to receivers.

   o  Network Providers, who provide network connectivity services
      (e.g., network providers are responsible for carrying multicast
      flows from head-ends to receivers).

   Note that some contract agreements prevent a network provider from
   altering the content as sent by the content provider for various
   reasons.  Depending on these contract agreements, multicast streams
   should be delivered unaltered to the requesting users.

   Most current IPTV content is likely to remain IPv4-formatted and out
   of the control of network providers.  Additionally, there are
   numerous legacy receivers (e.g., IPv4-only Set-Top Boxes (STBs)) that
   can't be upgraded or easily replaced to support IPv6.  As a
   consequence, IPv4 service continuity must be guaranteed during the
   transition period, including the delivery of multicast services such
   as Live TV Broadcasting to users.

Appendix B.  Older Versions of Group Membership Management Protocols

   Given the multiple versions of group membership management protocols,
   mismatch issues may arise at the mB4 (refer to Section 6.1).

   If IGMPv2 operates on the IPv4 receivers while MLDv2 operates on the
   MLD Querier, or if IGMPv3 operates on the IPv4 receivers while MLDv1
   operates on the MLD Querier, a version mismatch issue will be
   encountered.  To solve this problem, the mB4 should perform the
   router portion of IGMP, which is similar to the corresponding MLD
   version (IGMPv2 for MLDv1 or IGMPv3 for MLDv2) operating in the IPv6
   domain.  Then, the protocol interaction approach specified in
   Section 7 of [RFC3376] can be applied to exchange signaling messages
   with the IPv4 receivers on which the different version of IGMP is
   operating.

   Note that the support of IPv4 SSM requires MLDv2 to be enabled in the
   IPv6 network.
