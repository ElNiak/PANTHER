1.  Introduction

   Ethernet-based xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a. G.Bond/Ethernet, is
   specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.998.2 [G.998.2], which defines a
   method for bonding (or aggregating) multiple xDSL lines (or
   individual bearer channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single
   bidirectional logical link carrying Ethernet traffic.

   The MIB module defined in this document provides G.Bond/
   Ethernet-specific objects for the management of G.998.2 bonded
   interfaces, extending the common bonding objects specified in the
   GBOND-MIB module [RFC6765].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   "Management Framework for xDSL Bonding" [TR-159], defining a
   management model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded
   xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB), G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB), and Ethernet in the First
   Mile (EFM) Copper MIB (EFM-CU-MIB).

4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module

   A G.Bond/Ethernet port is a private case of a bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular, an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/Ethernet ports,
   as well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB Module

   The GBOND-MIB module [RFC6765] defines management objects common for
   all bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In particular, it describes
   the bonding management, bonded port and channel configuration,
   handshake-based discovery, initialization sequence, etc.

   Both the GBOND-MIB [RFC6765] and G9982-MIB (this document) modules
   are REQUIRED to manage a G.Bond/Ethernet port.

4.2.1.  BACP-Based Discovery

   All G.998 protocols share a remote Bonding Channel Entity (BCE)
   discovery, using the [G.994.1] handshake (G.hs).  The GBOND-MIB
   module provides an example of an automatic BCE connection to the
   corresponding Generic Bonding Sub-layer (GBS) ports of a generic

RFC 6767                   G.Bond/Ethernet MIB             February 2013


   G.998 multi-port Central Office (CO) device, using G.hs-based BCE
   discovery.  Amendment 2 to the ITU-T G.998.2 specification
   [G.998.2-Amd2] provides an alternative optional Bonding Aggregation
   Control Protocol (BACP) for in-service discovery, aggregation, and
   pair management.

   The following pseudocode gives the same example of the discovery and
   automatic BCE assignment for a multi-GBS G.Bond/Eth CO device, using
   BACP objects defined in this MIB module, as well as the
   IF-CAP-STACK-MIB [RFC5066] and IF-MIB modules.  Note that automatic
   BCE assignment is only shown here for the purposes of the example.
   Fixed BCE pre-assignment, manual assignment, or auto-assignment using
   an alternative internal algorithm may be chosen by a particular
   implementation:

   // Go over all GBS ports in the CO device
   FOREACH gbs[i] IN CO_device
   { // Perform discovery and auto-assignment on GBS ports
     // with room for more channels.
     IF ( gbs[i].NumBCEs < gbs[i].BondCapacity )
     { IF ( gbs[i].g9982OperCp == cpBACP )
       { // Using BACP

         // Get Eligible Group ID and Remote Group ID
         // from a connected BCE (during BACP
         // initialization, each BCE is connected to its own GBS)
         gid = ifStackTable[gbs[i]].bce[0].g9982BceEligibleGroupID;
         rgid =
           ifStackTable[gbs[i]].bce[0].g9982BcePeerEligibleGroupID;

         // Go over all disconnected channels, which can
         // potentially be connected to the GBS
         FOREACH bce[j] IN ifCapStackTable[gbs[i]] AND
                      NOT IN ifStackTable[gbs[i]]  // not connected
         { // Read the Remote Group ID for the selected BCE
           // and compare it with the Remote Group ID of the connected
           // BCE.
           r = bce[j].g9982BcePeerEligibleGroupID;
           IF ( r == rgid AND gbs[i].NumBCEs < gbs[i].BondCapacity )
           { // The Remote Terminal device (RT) connected via BCE[j] is
             // a peer for GBS[i], and there is room for another BCE in
             // the GBS[i] aggregation group (max. Bonding capacity is
             // not reached yet).
             // Connect this BCE to the GBS (via the ifStackTable; the
             // ifInvStackTable, which is the inverse of the
             // ifStackTable, is updated automatically; i.e., gbs[i] is
             // auto-added to ifInvStackTable[bce[j]]).

RFC 6767                   G.Bond/Ethernet MIB             February 2013


             ADD bce[j] TO ifStackTable[gbs[i]];
             gbs[i].NumBCEs = gbs[i].NumBCEs + 1;
           }
         }
         // At this point, we have discovered all local BCEs that
         // are physically connected to the same RT
         // and have connected them to GBS[i].  Go to the next GBS.
         BREAK;
       }
       ELSE
       { // Use default G.hs discovery protocol.
         ...
       }
     }
   }

   An SNMP agent for a G.Bond device builds the ifCapStackTable and its
   inverse -- the ifInvCapStackTable -- on device initialization,
   according to the cross-connect capabilities of the device.  When BACP
   is used, the g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID object identifying bonding
   eligibility MUST be automatically updated whenever the
   ifCapStackTable/ifInvCapStackTable are changed.

4.3.  Relationship to EFM Copper MIB Module

   The EFM-CU-MIB module [RFC5066] defines objects for managing Ethernet
   in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu) interfaces 10PASS-TS and 2BASE-TL,
   as defined in IEEE Std 802.3-2005 [802.3].  These interfaces are
   based on Single-pair High-speed DSL (SHDSL) [G.991.2] and Very high
   speed DSL (VDSL) [G.993.1] technology, respectively, and can be
   optionally aggregated (bonded).

   The ITU-T G.998.2 specification extends the IEEE 802.3 Clause 61
   bonding to work over any xDSL technology, providing the ability to
   bond individual channels as well as physical lines.  It also allows
   the use of alternative High-level Data Link Control (HDLC)
   encapsulation instead of the default 64/65-octet encapsulation and
   adds a new optional Bonding Aggregation Control Protocol (BACP) for
   in-service discovery, aggregation, and pair management instead of the
   default G.hs-based bonding protocol, which cannot be used in-service,
   while the link is 'up'.

   EFM-CU-MIB can be used to manage all aspects of the EFMCu physical
   interfaces (PHYs), including complete (within the scope of the 802.3
   standard) management of the SHDSL/VDSL lines.  The GBOND-MIB and
   G9982-MIB modules, on the other hand, provide management objects only
   for the bonding part, leaving the management of the individual xDSL
   interfaces (lines/channels) to the respective xDSL-LINE-MIB modules.



Beili & Morgenstern          Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6767                   G.Bond/Ethernet MIB             February 2013


   Therefore, an IEEE 802.3 2BASE-TL/10PASS-TS interface can be managed
   by either combination of the following MIB modules:

      IF-MIB + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB + EtherLike-MIB + MAU-MIB + EFM-CU-MIB

      IF-MIB + IF-CAP-STACK-MIB + GBOND-MIB + G9982-MIB +
      HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB/VDSL-LINE-MIB

   (The EtherLike-MIB, HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB, and VDSL-LINE-MIB modules
   are found in [RFC3635], [RFC4319], and [RFC3728], respectively.)

   Note also that while EFM-CU-MIB relies on the ifMauMediaAvailable
   object from MAU-MIB [RFC4836] for the additional bonded xDSL-specific
   operational states, GBOND-MIB provides these indications via the
   gBondPortStatFltStatus object, complementing the ifOperStatus object
   from the IF-MIB.

   Finally, the EFM-CU-MIB does not include historical Performance
   Monitoring (PM), while the GBOND-MIB/G9982-MIB/xDSL-LINE-MIB
   combination provides full PM functionality for a bonded link and
   individual xDSL lines.

4.4.  Relationship to IEEE 802.3.1 MIB Modules

   The IEEE 802.3 working group chartered a task force [IEEE802.3.1],
   which continues the development of standard Ethernet-related MIB
   modules based on the initial work done in the IETF.  Future projects
   resulting from the work of this task force may include and possibly
   extend the work done in the IETF.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   The main management objects defined in the G9982-MIB module are split
   into 2 groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:

   o  g9982Port - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status, and PM of G.Bond/Eth ports.  Note that the rest of the
      objects for the Generic Bonding Sub-layer (GBS) port
      configuration, capabilities, status, notifications, and PM are
      located in the GBOND-MIB module.

   o  g9982Bce - containing objects representing OPTIONAL status
      information and BACP configuration for each Bonding Channel Entity
      (BCE).  Note that the rest of the objects for the BCE

RFC 6767                   G.Bond/Ethernet MIB             February 2013


      configuration, capabilities, status, and notifications are located
      in relevant xDSL line MIB modules as well as in the GBOND-MIB
      module.

5.2.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history
   buckets (interval-counters), similar to those defined in [TR-159],
   are implemented using the textual conventions defined in the
   HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit
   versions of the textual conventions found in PerfHist-TC-MIB
   [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen-
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each
   one-day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a GBS is re-initialized, but rather only
   when the agent is reset or re-initialized.

5.3.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and the managed objects defined in
   this document.

                Table 1: Mapping of TR-159 Managed Objects

   Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR-159
   and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one-to-one; for
   example, while TR-159 PM attributes aGroupPerf* map to the
   corresponding gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, there are
   no dedicated PM attributes for the g9982PortPm* objects introduced in
   this MIB module.  However, since their definition is identical to the
   definition of gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, we can
   map g9982PortPm* to the relevant aGroupPerf* attributes of TR-159 and
   use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping
   is not one-to-one.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Changing of g9982PortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.,
      g9982PortConfTcAdminType) may lead to a complete service
      interruption in cases where the specified PTM-TC encapsulation
      type is not supported by the remote end.

   o  Changing of g9982BceConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.,
      g9982BceConfEligibleGroupID) may lead to preventing a non-bonded
      BCE from being bonded in any bonding group, or false advertisement
      of bonding eligibility (e.g., between BCEs residing on different
      line cards in an application that does not support cross-card
      bonding).

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they
   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and
   can reveal some aspects of their configuration.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the
   tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  g9982PortStatTable - objects in this table (e.g.,
      g9982PortStatTcOperType) provide status information for the G.Bond
      port, which may aid in deciphering of the G.Bond/ETH
      transmissions.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)

   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned 264 as the object identifier for the g9982MIB
   MODULE-IDENTITY in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree
   <http://www.iana.org/>.
