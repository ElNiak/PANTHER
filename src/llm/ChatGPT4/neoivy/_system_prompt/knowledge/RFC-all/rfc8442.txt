            ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites
                        for TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2

Abstract

   This document defines several new cipher suites for version 1.2 of
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and version 1.2 of the
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol.  These cipher
   suites are based on the Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman with
   Pre-Shared Key (ECDHE_PSK) key exchange together with the
   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms
   AES-GCM and AES-CCM.  PSK provides light and efficient
   authentication, ECDHE provides forward secrecy, and AES-GCM and
   AES-CCM provide encryption and integrity protection.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines new cipher suites that provide Pre-Shared Key
   (PSK) authentication, Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), and
   Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD).  The cipher
   suites are defined for version 1.2 of the Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) protocol [RFC5246] and version 1.2 of the Datagram Transport
   Layer Security (DTLS) protocol [RFC6347].

   PSK authentication is widely used in many scenarios.  One deployment
   is 3GPP networks where pre-shared keys are used to authenticate both
   subscriber and network.  Another deployment is Internet of Things
   where PSK authentication is often preferred for performance and
   energy efficiency reasons.  In both scenarios, the endpoints are
   owned and/or controlled by a party that provisions the pre-shared
   keys and makes sure that they provide a high level of entropy.

   Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a strongly recommended feature in
   security protocol design and can be accomplished by using an
   ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange method.  Ephemeral Elliptic

RFC 8442           ECDHE_PSK with AEAD for (D)TLS 1.2     September 2018


   Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) provides PFS with excellent performance
   and small key sizes.  ECDHE is mandatory to implement in both HTTP/2
   [RFC7540] and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252].

   AEAD algorithms that combine encryption and integrity protection are
   strongly recommended for (D)TLS [RFC7525], and TLS 1.3 [RFC8446]
   forbids the use of non-AEAD algorithms.  The AEAD algorithms
   considered in this document are AES-GCM and AES-CCM.  The use of
   AES-GCM in TLS is defined in [RFC5288], and the use of AES-CCM is
   defined in [RFC6655].

   [RFC4279] defines PSK cipher suites for TLS but does not consider
   elliptic curve cryptography.  [RFC8422] introduces elliptic curve
   cryptography for TLS but does not consider PSK authentication.
   [RFC5487] describes the use of AES-GCM in combination with PSK
   authentication but does not consider ECDHE.  [RFC5489] describes the
   use of PSK in combination with ECDHE but does not consider AES-GCM or
   AES-CCM.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ECDHE_PSK with AES-GCM and AES-CCM Cipher Suites

   The cipher suites defined in this document are based on the following
   AES-GCM and AES-CCM AEAD algorithms: AEAD_AES_128_GCM [RFC5116],
   AEAD_AES_256_GCM [RFC5116], AEAD_AES_128_CCM [RFC5116], and
   AEAD_AES_128_CCM_8 [RFC6655].

   Messages and premaster secret construction in this document are
   defined in [RFC5489].  The ServerKeyExchange and ClientKeyExchange
   messages are used, and the premaster secret is computed as for the
   ECDHE_PSK key exchange.  The elliptic curve parameters used in the
   Diffie-Hellman parameters are negotiated using extensions defined in
   [RFC8422].

   For TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2, the following cipher suites are defined:

   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xD0,0x01}
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xD0,0x02}
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256 = {0xD0,0x03}
   TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256   = {0xD0,0x05}

RFC 8442           ECDHE_PSK with AEAD for (D)TLS 1.2     September 2018


   The assigned code points can only be used for TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2.

   The cipher suites defined in this document MUST NOT be negotiated for
   any version of (D)TLS other than version 1.2.  Servers MUST NOT
   select one of these cipher suites when selecting a (D)TLS version
   other than version 1.2.  A client MUST treat the selection of these
   cipher suites in combination with a different version of (D)TLS as an
   error and generate a fatal 'illegal_parameter' TLS alert.

   Cipher suites TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
   TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256, and TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256 are used to
   support equivalent functionality in TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the following new cipher suites for TLS 1.2 and
   DTLS 1.2.  The values have been assigned in the "TLS Cipher Suites"
   registry defined by [RFC8446] and [RFC8447].

  Value       Description                            DTLS-OK Recommended
  -----       -----------                            ------- -----------
  {0xD0,0x01} TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256    Y         Y
  {0xD0,0x02} TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384    Y         Y
  {0xD0,0x03} TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256  Y         N
  {0xD0,0x05} TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_SHA256    Y         Y

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in TLS 1.2 [RFC5246], DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347],
   PSK Ciphersuites for TLS [RFC4279], ECDHE_PSK [RFC5489], AES-GCM
   [RFC5288], and AES-CCM [RFC6655] apply to this document as well.

   All the cipher suites defined in this document provide
   confidentiality, mutual authentication, and forward secrecy.  The
   AES-128 cipher suites provide 128-bit security, and the AES-256
   cipher suites provide at least 192-bit security.  However,
   AES_128_CCM_8 only provides 64-bit security against message forgery.

   The pre-shared keys used for authentication MUST have a security
   level equal to or higher than the cipher suite used, i.e., at least
   128-bit security for the AES-128 cipher suites and at least 192-bit
   security for the AES-256 cipher suites.

   GCM or CCM encryption that reuses a nonce with a same key undermines
   the security of GCM and CCM.  As a result, GCM and CCM MUST only be
   used with a system guaranteeing nonce uniqueness [RFC5116].
