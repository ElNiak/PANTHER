Abstract

   Interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify
   interfaces on a link.  They are required to be unique within a
   subnet.  Several RFCs have specified interface identifiers or
   identifier ranges that have a special meaning attached to them.  An
   IPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these ranges
   will encounter unexpected consequences.  Since there is no
   centralized repository for such reserved identifiers, this document
   aims to create one.

1.  Introduction

   An IPv6 unicast address is composed of two parts: a subnet prefix and
   an interface identifier (IID) that identifies a unique interface
   within the subnet prefix.  The structure of an IPv6 unicast address
   is depicted in "IPv6 Addressing Architecture" [RFC4291] and is
   replicated here for clarity.

   |          n bits               |           128-n bits            |
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+
   |       subnet prefix           |           interface ID          |
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+

                   Figure 1: IPv6 Unicast Address Format

   For all unicast addresses, except those that start with the binary
   value 000, Interface IDs are required to be 64 bits long and to be
   constructed in Modified EUI-64 format [RFC4291].  Examples of
   mechanisms that generate interface identifiers without a unique token
   include Cryptographically Generated Addresses [RFC3972], Privacy
   Addresses [RFC4941], Hash-Based Addresses [HBA], etc.  Non-unique
   interface identifiers can also be allocated using managed address
   assignment mechanisms like DHCPv6 (Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv6) [RFC3315].

1.1.  Applicability

   This document applies only to interface identifiers that are formed
   in the modified EUI-64 format as defined in Appendix A of [RFC4291].
   All other types of interface identifiers are out of its scope.

1.2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Issues with Reusing Reserved Interface Identifiers

   Let us assume a node comes up with an interface identifier that has
   been reserved for use in some other capacity, e.g., an IPv6 node that
   uses temporary IPv6 addresses [RFC4941] comes up with an IID of
   fdff:ffff:ffff:ffff.  This node will receive requests from all nodes
   that are requesting a service from a Mobile IPv6 home agent since the
   above-mentioned interface identifier has been reserved in [RFC2526]
   to serve as a MIPv6 home agent's anycast address.  At best, this is
   an annoyance to the node that came up with this address.  At worst,
   another node on the link would be denied service and may not look for
   other methods of acquiring a home agent.  Thus, such reserved
   interface identifiers MUST NOT be used for autonomous
   autoconfiguration or for managed address configuration.

2.1.  Possible Solutions

   There are two possible ways to go about avoiding usage of these
   reserved interface identifiers.  One of them would be to add a
   normative reference to each specification that reserves an interface
   identifier.  The other would be to create an IANA registry for such
   interface identifiers.  There are two disadvantages to the normative
   reference approach.  Firstly, this approach does not scale well
   because the number of such specifications that would need to be
   updated is large.  Secondly, the maturity level of the document
   reserving the IID might be lower than the one prohibited from using
   it; this will cause a downward reference problem.  Therefore, the
   better solution is to create an IANA registry for this purpose.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates an IANA registry for reserved IPv6 interface
   identifiers.  Initial values for the reserved IPv6 interface
   identifiers are given below.

   |                                         |    Addresses[RFC2526]   |
   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+

                       Table 1: Current Assignments

   It is possible that implementations might predate a specific
   assignment from this registry and hence not be cognizant of the
   reserved nature of the interface identifier.  Hence, future
   assignments from this registry are discouraged.  Future assignments,
   if any, are to be made through Standards Action [RFC5226].
   Assignments consist of a single interface identifier or a range of
   interface identifiers.

   NOTE: The address :: (all zeros in the interface identifier field) is
   used as the unspecified address and ::/0 is used as a default route
   indicator, as specified in [RFC5156].  These uses do not conflict
   with the reserved interface identifiers defined here, since the
   reserved identifiers defined in this document are used for avoiding
   conflicts with stateless address autoconfiguration that utilizes a
   64-bit prefix length.

   this document and suggesting changes.

5.  Security Considerations

   By utilizing one of the reserved interface identifiers, an IPv6 node
   might receive requests that it is not authorized to receive.
   Information that creates or updates a registration in this registry
   needs to be authenticated and authorized by the IANA based on the
   instructions set forth by [RFC5226].
