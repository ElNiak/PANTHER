                     The ORIGIN Extension in HTTP/3

Abstract

   The ORIGIN frame for HTTP/2 is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but it
   needs to be separately registered.  This document describes the
   ORIGIN frame for HTTP/3.

1.  Introduction

   Existing RFCs define extensions to HTTP/2 [HTTP/2] that remain useful
   in HTTP/3.  Appendix A.2 of [HTTP/3] describes the required updates
   for HTTP/2 frames to be used with HTTP/3.

   [ORIGIN] defines the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame, which indicates what
   origins are available on a given connection.  It defines a single
   HTTP/2 frame type.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The frame diagram in this document uses the format defined in
   Section 1.3 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT] to illustrate the order and size of
   fields.

2.  The ORIGIN HTTP/3 Frame

   The ORIGIN HTTP/3 frame allows a server to indicate what origin or
   origins [RFC6454] the server would like the client to consider as one
   or more members of the Origin Set (Section 2.3 of [ORIGIN]) for the
   connection within which it occurs.

   The semantics of the frame payload are identical to those of the
   HTTP/2 frame defined in [ORIGIN].  Where HTTP/2 reserves stream 0 for
   frames related to the state of the connection, HTTP/3 defines a pair
   of unidirectional streams called "control streams" for this purpose.

   Where [ORIGIN] indicates that the ORIGIN frame is sent on stream 0,
   this should be interpreted to mean the HTTP/3 control stream: that
   is, the ORIGIN frame is sent from servers to clients on the server's
   control stream.

   HTTP/3 does not define a Flags field in the generic frame layout.  As
   no flags have been defined for the ORIGIN frame, this specification
   does not define a mechanism for communicating such flags in HTTP/3.

2.1.  Frame Layout

   The ORIGIN frame has a layout that is nearly identical to the layout
   used in HTTP/2; the information is restated here for clarity.  The
   ORIGIN frame type is 0x0c (decimal 12), as in HTTP/2.  The payload
   contains zero or more instances of the Origin-Entry field.

   HTTP/3 Origin-Entry {
     Origin-Len (16),
     ASCII-Origin (..),
   }

   HTTP/3 ORIGIN Frame {
     Type (i) = 0x0c,
     Length (i),
     Origin-Entry (..) ...,
   }

                       Figure 1: ORIGIN Frame Layout

   An Origin-Entry is a length-delimited string.  Specifically, it
   contains two fields:

   Origin-Len:  An unsigned, 16-bit integer indicating the length, in
      octets, of the ASCII-Origin field.

   ASCII-Origin:  An OPTIONAL sequence of characters containing the
      ASCII serialization of an origin ([RFC6454], Section 6.2) that the
      sender asserts this connection is or could be authoritative for.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [ORIGIN] and [HTTP/3].

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a frame type in the "HTTP/3 Frame Types"
   registry defined by [HTTP/3], located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/http3-parameters/>.

   Value:  0x0c
