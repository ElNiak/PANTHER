           Reassignment of Experimental MIBs to Standard MIBs

Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Statement

   In the past, MIBs have been assigned arcs in the experimental MIB
   namespace early in their development and then were not assigned arcs
   in the standard MIB namespace until they reached Full Standard
   status.  This practice required vendors to revise their
   implementations when a MIB went from Draft to Full Standard status,
   even though there was probably no substantive technical change in the
   definitions.  This practice could also engender operational problems
   in the field at an undesirably late stage of the standardization
   process.  It was also observed that this practice could discourage
   implementation until the Full Standard stage and that this, too,
   would be undesirable.  So, a preferable practice is to assign arcs in
   the standard MIB namespace at the earliest phase of standardization
   and to preserve these assignments as the standard progresses.

   This memo specifically updates:

      RFC 1229 - "Extensions to the Generic-Interface MIB"

      RFC 1230 - "IEEE 802.4 Token Bus MIB"

      RFC 1231 - "IEEE 802.5 Token Ring MIB"

      RFC 1232 - "Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1 Interface
                  Type"

      RFC 1233 - "Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS3 Interface
                  Type"

   with new codes.  In the future, consult each MIB publication for new
   code assignments.
