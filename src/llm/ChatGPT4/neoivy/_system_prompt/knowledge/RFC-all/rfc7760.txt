1.  Introduction

   A prominent member of the IETF community has developed a set of tools
   to produce statistics about the authors of RFCs and Internet-Drafts.
   These tools analyze the documents themselves to produce statistics
   about the documents and their authors.  The goal of the IETF
   Datatracker enhancements described in this document is to provide
   similar statistics and ensure that the software is maintained as part
   of the IETF information services.  While some data may still need to
   be extracted from the documents themselves, as much data as possible
   should be maintained in the IETF Datatracker database [DATATRACKER].

   Current statistics are available on the web at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/docstats.html.

   The code that is used to produce these statistics is available at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/authorstats.html.

2.  Purpose

   Author statistics allow the community to understand where work is
   being done and by whom.  The statistics make it visible which
   individuals, companies, and geographic regions are the most active
   contributors.  The statistics also show how these are changing over
   the years.

RFC 7760                SOW for Author Statistics           January 2016


   Some of the statistics provide "nice to know" information; however,
   others are sometimes used to refer to a particular participant's
   contributions in the IETF or used to study trends within IETF work.
   For instance, the IETF has been trying to increase the diversity of
   participants, and the statistics are one way to see the impact of
   those efforts.  Also, the most active individuals are potential
   candidates for various leadership positions.

3.  Statistics

   The enhancements to the IETF Datatracker shall provide statistics and
   graphs about documents, document authors, author affiliation, author
   country, and author continent.

   The statistics should also include trends relating to IETF meeting
   attendees, which the current tools do not track.

   For the purposes of these requirements, "recent Internet-Drafts" and
   "recent RFCs" cover documents that have been published in the last
   five years.

3.1.  Documents

   The statistics shall provide insight into the number of authors per
   document.  The current web page presents the statistics and a bar
   chart.  The current web page can be seen at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/authdistr.html.

   The statistics shall provide insight into the size of the documents.
   The current web page presents the statistics and a bar chart.  The
   current web page can be seen at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/pagedistr.html.  With the planned
   change in document format, some other way to measure document size
   might be more appropriate, such as word count.

   Additionally, statistics about the document format that was used by
   the authors should be provided, which is not provided by the current
   tools.

   The statistics shall provide insight into the use of various
   specification techniques such as ABNF, ASN.1, C code, CBOR, JSON, and
   XML.  The current web page does not include all of these techniques.
   The current web page can be seen at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/formatdistr.html.

3.2.  Authors

   The statistics shall provide insight into the distribution of authors
   according to the number of documents they have authored for recent
   Internet-Drafts, recent RFCs, and all RFCs.  The current web pages
   that provide similar information include the statistics and a bar
   chart.  The web pages are available at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/stats/authactdistr.html,
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/recrfcstats/authactdistr.html, and
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/authactdistr.html.

   The statistics shall provide insight into the relative impact of
   authors by the number of their RFCs that are cited by other RFCs.
   The current web page can be seen at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/hindextop.html.

3.3.  Affiliation of Authors

   The statistics shall provide insight into the affiliation of authors
   for recent Internet-Drafts, recent RFCs, and all RFCs.  The current
   web pages that provide similar information include the statistics and
   a bar chart.  The web pages are available at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/allstats/companies.html,
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/stats/companydistr.html,
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/recrfcstats/companydistr.html, and
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/companydistr.html.

   The statistics shall provide insight into the way that affiliations
   of RFC authors have changed over the years.  The current web page can
   be seen at http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/companydistrhist.html.

3.4.  Countries of Authors

   The statistics shall provide insight into countries of authors for
   recent Internet-Drafts, recent RFCs, and all RFCs.  It has been
   useful to provide country-based statistics, and it has also been
   useful to provide statistics showing the European Union (EU) as a
   single "country" for the sake of comparison with other large
   countries.  The current web pages that provide similar information
   include the statistics and a bar chart.  The web pages are available
   at http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/countries.html,
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/stats/d-countrydistr.html,
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/stats/d-countryeudistr.html,

   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/countrydistr.html, and
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/countryeudistr.html.

   The statistics shall illustrate the change in number of Internet-
   Draft and RFC authors per country over time.  The current web page
   can be seen at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/countrydistrhist.html.

3.5.  Continents of Authors

   The statistics shall provide insight into continents of authors for
   recent Internet-Drafts, recent RFCs, and all RFCs.  The current web
   pages that provide similar information include the statistics and a
   bar chart.  The web pages are available at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/stats/d-contdistr.html,
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/recrfcstats/d-contdistr.html, and
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/d-contdistr.html.

   The statistics shall illustrate the change in number of Internet-
   Draft and RFC authors per continent over time.  The current pages can
   be seen at http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/d-contdistrhist.html.

4.  IETF Meeting Attendees

   The enhancements to the IETF Datatracker shall provide statistics and
   graphs about the country and continent of IETF meeting participants.

4.1.  Countries of IETF Meeting Attendees

   The statistics shall provide insight into countries represented by
   attendees at each IETF meeting.  Country-based statistics have been
   presented in the plenary session for many years.  For consistency
   with the author statistics discussed in Section 3 of this document,
   the statistics will include a way to show the EU as a single
   "country" for the sake of comparison with other large countries.  The
   statistics for each meeting should be accompanied with a pie chart
   that shows the eight countries with the highest number of attendees
   and "other".

   The statistics shall illustrate the change in number of IETF meeting
   attendees per country over time.  Again, for consistency with the
   author statistics discussed in Section 3 of this document, the
   statistics will include a way to show the EU as a single "country".

4.2.  Continents of IETF Meeting Attendees

   The statistics shall provide insight into continents represented by
   attendees at each IETF meeting.

   The statistics shall illustrate the change in number of IETF meeting
   attendees per continent over time.

5.  Existing Code

   Since the new code will be driven by the Datatracker database to the
   greatest extent possible, the existing code may be of limited value.
   The existing code was intended as a temporary solution and requires a
   rewrite.  However, a set of heuristics used by the code may be
   useful.  These heuristics are provided in a separate rule database
   and are used as a last resort when there is otherwise too little
   information.  The heuristics include author aliases, some recognized
   authors and some recognized affiliations, domain name data for
   determining location and affiliation, and mappings for some ways that
   people represent their countries in a post address.

   Authors are not consistent about the way their names appear in
   various documents.  For example, one document may include their given
   name and another document may include a nickname.  The Datatracker

RFC 7760                SOW for Author Statistics           January 2016


   database provides a way to capture aliases, but not all of the
   aliases in the documents have been added to the database.

   The current Datatracker database does not have tables for heuristics
   other than author aliases that are used in the current tool.
   Appropriate tables to hold the additional heuristics from the current
   rule database should be added to the Datatracker database in a manner
   agreed by the group of people that maintain the Datatracker source
   code.

   A workable web interface, possibly using Django Admin, to update the
   new heuristics tables shall be provided.

   The current code can be found at
   http://www.arkko.com/tools/authorstats.html and is openly available
   but without any warranty.

   The software is split in two parts, with the code itself being
   separate from the heuristics database.  The two main components of
   the code are authorstats, which produces the statistics and generates
   the statistics web pages, and getauthors, which performs document
   analysis.

6.  Deployment

   The current tools analyze the documents themselves to produce
   statistics.  Some of the data needed to produce the statistics is not
   currently in the Datatracker database.  This development effort will
   include adding the capability to capture this data in the Datatracker
   database and populate it for all RFCs and Internet-Drafts posted over
   the last five years.  It may be cost-effective to leverage the
   existing code to extract the information and then verify it one time.

   The URLs for the current tools exist in many places in the Web.  Once
   a suitable replacement tool is available, the author of the original
   tools has promised to provide a suitable form of redirection.

7.  Thoughts on Future Enhancements

   With the planned change in document format, some of the information
   obtained through heuristics might be more directly extracted from the
   XML file.  Once this format is being used by a significant number of
   authors, a future effort might move away from heuristics toward
   extraction from the XML file.  To support this approach, it would be
   desirable for the new XML schema to make the author's continent of
   residence available, even if it not used in the formatting of the
   human-readable document.

   Currently, the Datatracker has information about document authors,
   but not other contributors.  If information is added to the
   Datatracker in the future to cover contributors, then the statistics
   can be expanded to cover contributors as well as authors.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document contains the SOW for enhancements to the IETF
   Datatracker to provide author statistics.  These enhancements do not
   affect the security of the Internet.  The enhancements provide
   statistics about documents that are available to the public without
   prior authentication, and the statistics will also be available to
   the public without prior authentication.
