Abstract

   This document describes a collection of MGCP (Media Gateway Control
   Protocol) packages that can be used to take advantage of the feature
   keys and displays on digital business phones and IP-Phones.

IESG Note

   This document is being published for the information of the
   community.  It describes a non-IETF protocol that is currently being
   deployed in a number of products.  Implementers should be aware that
   the IETF Megaco working group and the ITU-T Study Group 16 have
   produced a standards track RFC "Megaco Protocol Version 1.0" (RFC
   3015, also published as ITU recommendation H.248) which addresses the
   same problem space and are developing extensions to that protocol for
   functions of this type.

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


1. Introduction

   The Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Version 1.0 defines a
   protocol for controlling Voice over IP Telephony Gateways from
   external call control elements.  As defined, it supports external
   call control elements called Media Gateway Controllers and assumes
   that these Gateways can support collections of endpoints.  The
   endpoint type known as an "analog line" can be used as a client
   interface to provide service to a basic analog telephone unit.  The
   packages that are currently defined to handle events and signals
   allow for only a basic level of audio connection and signaling to
   such endpoints.  To handle more advanced capabilities commonly found
   on business phones such as feature keys, speaker phones and displays,
   it is necessary to define additional packages as extensions to the
   MGCP protocol.

   These packages, when used in conjunction with the packages currently
   defined in RFC 2705 (Media Gateway Control Protocol Version 1.0) [1],
   allow an MGCP Call Agent to control business phone endpoints.

   The MGCP extension packages defined here are as follows:

      - Feature Key Package

         o  Groups events and signals associated with the additional
            keys available on business phones that are non-DTMF and not
            locally-implemented.  These include:

            -  Feature Key event to allow mapping of key numbers to
               features.
            -  Key State signal to indicate the state of feature keys.
            -  Set Label signal to display a label on the LCD next to a
               feature key.

      -  Business Phone Package

         o  Groups signals that are not related to feature keys,
            including:

            -  Force Off-hook and Force On-hook signals to allow
               application integration with speaker phone capabilities.
            -  Beep signal to play a beep on the phone.

      - Display XML Package

         o  Used to convey XML [2] script data to and from the phone to
            control the display and assign functions to the display
            soft-keys for event reporting.  These include:

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


            -  XML event to report user input or selection.
            -  XML signal to render text to the LCD display.

   An MGCP experimental parameter is also defined here:

      -  User Agent Parameter

         o  Used to determine the make and model of a phone

1.1     General Information

   A generic business phone typically includes a number of features that
   provide access to additional functionality useful in a business
   environment.  Beyond the basic handset and dial pad, a business phone
   may optionally include a number of fixed buttons, line keys and
   programmable feature keys, along with an LCD display and soft-keys.

   Specific examples of items that may be included on a business phone
   are:

   - Speaker phone microphone and speaker
   - Speaker phone button and light
   - Messages button and light
   - Redial button
   - Volume up and down buttons
   - Hold button and light
   - Transfer button and light
   - Forward button and light
   - Conference button and light
   - Microphone mute button and light
   - Multiple feature keys with lights
   - Multi-line LCD Display
   - Multiple soft-keys next to the LCD display
   - Navigation keys

   Examples of fixed buttons functionality are 'hold', 'transfer',
   'redial', 'conference', 'call-logs', 'directories', and 'messages'.
   Fixed buttons may vary from phone to phone.  While the packages
   described here would allow these to be reported to a Call Agent, the
   Call Agent would also need to determine which feature key number
   corresponds to a particular pre-assigned function.

   Since MGCP assumes a call control architecture where the call control
   "intelligence" is outside the Gateways and handled by external call
   control elements, the programming of the feature keys would be
   resident in the Call Agent.  If the user were to press the 'hold'
   button, the phone would simply report the key number, and the burden




Srinath, et al.              Informational                      [Page 4]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   of recognizing that this feature key is assigned to the 'hold'
   function, and providing such functionality, is left to the Call
   Agent.

1.2 Objectives

   The high level objectives that were considered in generating the
   packages described here are:

   -  Provide a minimum set of extension packages to the MGCP Version
      1.0 protocol to allow applications to take advantage of generic
      business phone capabilities.

   -  Provide event and control extensions at a sufficiently low level
      for an application to implement generic business phone functions
      without generating excessive or redundant data traffic.  (e.g.,
      sending feature key information on both press and release would be
      a "don't care" for a Call Agent.  All it cares about is that the
      key was pressed.)

   -  Provide a mechanism to interface with LCD displays and allow the
      flexibility to accommodate a variety of application needs and the
      different types of displays available.

2. MGCP Packages for Business Phones

   The following packages should be implemented for business phones.
   The G,D,L, and H packages are defined in RFC 2705 [1].  Packages KY,
   BP and XML are defined in this specification.

    ______________________________________________________
   | Package                      |   Name  | Defined     |
   |______________________________|_________|_____________|
   | Generic Media Package        |   G     |in RFC 2705  |
   | DTMF package                 |   D     |in RFC 2705  |
   | Line Package                 |   L     |in RFC 2705  |
   | Handset Package              |   H     |in RFC 2705  |
   | Feature Key Package          |   KY    |in this spec |
   | Business Phone Package       |   BP    |in this spec |
   | Display XML Package          |   XML   |in this spec |
   |______________________________|_________|_____________|

   In the tables of events for each package, there are five columns:

   Symbol: the unique symbol used for the event
   Definition: a short description of the event





Srinath, et al.              Informational                      [Page 5]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   R: an x appears in this column if the event can be requested by the
      Call Agent.

   S: if nothing appears in this column for an event, then the event
      cannot be signalled on command by the Call Agent.  Otherwise, the
      following symbols identify the type of signal:

      OO On/Off signal.  The signal is turned on until requested by the
         Call Agent to turn it off, and vice versa.

      TO Timeout signal.  The signal lasts for a given duration unless
         it is superseded by a new signal.

      BR Brief signal.  The event has a short, known duration.

      Duration: specifies the duration of TO signals.

2.1 Feature Key Package

   Package Name: KY

   The Feature Key Package groups events and signals that are associated
   with the additional keys that are available on business phones.

 ____________________________________________________________________
| Symbol   |   Definition               |   R |   S      Duration    |
|__________|____________________________|_____|______________________|
| fk1-fk99 | Feature Key                |   x |                      |
| ks       | Key State                  |     |   OO                 |
| ls       | Set Label                  |     |   OO                 |
|__________|____________________________|_____|______________________|

   Feature Key (fk1-fk99)

      These events map to all the keys on the phone that are not DTMF
      keys or locally implemented functions (such as volume).  The
      mapping of fk number to key is expected to vary between phones.

      Note: Some have suggested parameterizing the fk event, i.e.,
      sending an RQNT with "R: KY/fk" and an NTFY with "O: KY/fk(1)",
      but this is problematic;  It is desirable to request only the keys
      that can be pressed in a given state, to eliminate the chance that
      a mis-pressed button will cancel a timeout signal, as well as to
      reduce message traffic.  This is not possible within the confines
      of MGCP, as requested events cannot be parameterized.

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   Key State (ks)

      This signal is used to indicate the state of a feature key.  It
      should be ignored by phones without this capability.

      This signal has two parameters: key number and state.  The key
      number maps directly to the feature key number.  The state is a
      high level description of the state of the key.  This allows
      different phones to implement different indications of state.  For
      example, Phone A may have a multi-color LED associated with
      feature keys that can blink at different cadences.  Phone B might
      have an LCD beside the keys that can display text or icons.  It is
      up to each phone vendor to determine how to present the state
      indication.

      The following states are used:

       ______________________
      | State | Definition   |
      |_______|______________|
      |  en   | enabled      |
      |  db   | disabled     |
      |  id   | idle         |
      |  dt   | dial tone    |
      |  cn   | connected    |
      |  dc   | disconnected |
      |  rg   | ringing      |
      |  rb   | ringback     |
      |  ho   | holding      |
      |  he   | held         |
      |_______|______________|

      For example: an RQNT with "S: KY/ks(5,en)" will cause an indicator
      corresponding to fk5 to indicate that it is enabled.  An RQNT with
      "S: KY/ks(2,rg)" will cause an indicator corresponding to fk2 to
      indicate that it is ringing.

   "en" state

      The associated feature is enabled.  Used for keys that turn a
      feature on or off, such as "Do Not Disturb."

   "db" state

      The associated feature is disabled.  Used for keys that turn a
      feature on or off, such as "Do Not Disturb."

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   "id" state

      The specified line appearance is in the idle state, available for
      a call.

   "dt" state

      The specified line appearance is providing dial-tone.

   "cn" state

      The specified line appearance is actively in a call, in the
      connected state.

   "dc" state

      The specified line appearance is disconnected, but the
      corresponding line is still active (the user is still offhook).

   "rg" state

      The specified line appearance is terminating an incoming call, in
      the ringing state.

   "rb" state

      The specified line appearance is originating an outgoing call, in
      the ringing-back state.

   "ho" state

      The specified line appearance is in the holding state, with the
      far end held.

   "he" state

      The specified line appearance is in the held state, with the far
      end holding.

   Set Label (ls)

      This signal is used to set the label on a key.  This is used for
      phones that have an LCD next to the feature keys.  It should be
      ignored by phones without this capability.

      This signal has 2 parameters: key number and label.  The key
      number maps directly to the feature key number.  The label is free
      form text, restricted to the capabilities of the phone.



Srinath, et al.              Informational                      [Page 8]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


      For example, an RQNT with "S: KY/ls(1,2200)" sets the label next
      to the fk1 feature key to the string "2200" (a phone extension).

2.2 Business Phone Package

   Package Name: BP

   The Business Phone Package groups signals other than those related to
   feature keys and displays.

 ____________________________________________________________________
| Symbol   |   Definition               |   R |   S      Duration    |
|__________|____________________________|_____|______________________|
| hd       | Force Offhook              |     |   OO                 |
| hu       | Force Onhook               |     |   OO                 |
| beep     | Beep                       |     |   BR                 |
|__________|____________________________|_____|______________________|

   Force Offhook (hd)

      This signal is used to force the phone offhook.  If the phone has
      a speaker phone, it should be activated.  This signal can be
      negated by the user by hanging up.

      This can be used if a feature key causes a call to be initiated.
      See the sample call flow in Appendix C.

      This can also be used for application integration.  For example, a
      user could select a number in an application on their PC, and the
      phone would be forced offhook and a call initiated.

   Force Onhook (hu)

      This signal forces the phone onhook.  This can be used when the
      far-end disconnects, or if a feature key causes a call to be
      terminated.

   Beep (beep)

      Play a beep on the phone.

2.3 Display XML Package

   Package Name: XML

   The XML Package contains one event/signal that is used to convey XML
   data to and from the phone.




Srinath, et al.              Informational                      [Page 9]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


 _____________________________________________________________________
| Symbol   |   Definition               |   R |   S      Duration    |
|__________|____________________________|_____|______________________|
| xml      | XML Data                   |   x |   OO                 |
|__________|____________________________|_____|______________________|

   XML Data (xml)

      As an event, if this event is requested in an RQNT with "R:
      XML/xml", any posts of data from an XML script are returned in an
      NTFY with "O: XML/xml(post data here)".

      As a signal, the parameterized data indicates a URL to an XML
      script (possibly local), as well as substitution values that
      depend on the XML script selected.  See section 5 for more
      information.

3. Endpoint Naming and Phone Type Determination

   Because the display state can be asynchronous from the signaling
   state of the phone, it is desirable to address the display as a
   separate MGCP endpoint.

   For example, suppose a call is presented to the phone, and a display
   is presented that gives the user the option of redirecting the caller
   immediately to voice-mail.  Selecting the option via the display
   would cause an XML post to occur, cancelling any timeout signals (the
   ringing).

   In order to simplify the handling of such scenarios, it is expected
   that the related display have a different MGCP endpoint name, created
   by inserting a prefix before the phone endpoint name.  The prefix
   used shall be "disp/".

   For example, if the phone endpoint has the name
   "ep1@foo.whatever.net", the display endpoint would be named
   "disp/ep1@foo.whatever.net".

   The Call Agent must be able to determine which feature key number
   corresponds to a particular pre-assigned function.  For example, one
   phone may have the pre-assigned functions of 'redial' and 'hold'
   mapped to feature keys numbered fk1 and fk23, respectively. Another
   phone may not report fk23 at all, and have the pre-assigned function
   of 'transfer' mapped to fk1.  Also, since the programming of feature
   keys would be resident in the Call Agent, a user-interface that

   allows the programming of these keys must know the keys supported on
   the phone, in order for the Call Agent to request the appropriate
   feature keys.

   Determination of such basic capabilities must occur at the moment
   when the phone sends its first RSIP message to a Call Agent.  While
   it might be possible to define packages with events and signals that
   allow for an exhaustive discovery of the layout of a particular
   phone, a simpler and more reasonable approach would be for the Call
   Agent to discover the make and model of the phone, and thus determine
   the capabilities of the phone.  To this end, an experimental
   parameter, "X-UA" has been introduced for use in the Requested-Info
   field (F:) of the AUEP method.  The response to the "X-UA" is
   expected to be a string that uniquely identifies the make and model
   of the phone.  Note that per RFC 2705, a Gateway must ignore
   experimental parameters prefixed as "X-" that it cannot support,
   versus respond with an error code such as 511 (Unrecognized
   extension).  See the sample call flow in Appendix C.

4. Functions that should be Locally Implemented

   Some functions should be implemented locally on the Gateway.  These
   are listed in the following sections.

4.1 Volume Control

   Volume for ringing, handset, and speaker phone should be implemented
   locally on the Gateway.

4.2 Audio Path

   If the phone includes a speaker phone, activating the speaker phone
   from the idle state should generate an offhook (L/hd) event.  The
   user should then be able to switch to handset mode by lifting the
   handset, and be able to switch back to speaker phone mode without any
   interaction with the Call Agent.  De-activating the speaker phone
   with the handset on-hook should generate an onhook (L/hu) event.

4.3 Microphone mute button and light

   If the phone includes a microphone mute button and (optionally) an
   associated indicator (e.g., light), the functionality of these items
   should be implemented locally on the Gateway.

5. XML Package Support

   Not all business phones have the same display and keypad
   capabilities.  To support these varying devices in a consistent
   manner, this section outlines an XML framework that is used to drive
   the phone.  In this framework, the Call Agent pushes XML requests to
   the Gateway using MGCP signals.  These XML requests indicate the XML
   document that is to be rendered on the phone.

   When a user inputs data or makes a selection from a display, the
   Gateway "posts" an XML request to the Call Agent using MGCP events.

5.1 XML Documents

   When an XML signal request is sent to an endpoint, it indicates the
   XML documents that the endpoint must process.  These documents
   contain tags that are a subset of the Wireless Markup Language (WML)
   [3] plus some non-WML additions.  These tags specify items to be
   displayed as well as XML events that may be reported as the result of
   user input.

   Each XML document, known as a card, defines a user interaction.  A
   group of cards is called a deck.  One or more decks define an
   application.  The cards define soft key behavior as well as display
   behavior, and are mapped to components that implement the behavior of
   a basic graphical user interface on the display phone.  Based on the
   available requirements, the components needed are:

      - Input box:

        allows user input, including editing capabilities, via the
        keypad.

      - Enumerated list box:

        allows the user to select one of a list of items.

      - Itemized list box:

        allows the user to select an item using a soft key.

      - Text box:

        displays read-only text to the user.

      - Echo box:

        displays but does not process user input.



Srinath, et al.              Informational                     [Page 12]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   A card may have the following properties.

      1. Timed content (e.g., card expiration)
      2. Static content  (e.g., text)
      3. Dynamic content (e.g., call timers/time)

   Additionally, cards may also contain variables to be substituted for
   values that are specified in an XML request.  See section 5.2 for
   details on variable substitution.

   There are cases where the XML scripts handling the display need to
   use keys that are also used by the phone.  For example, the display
   could present an enumerated list, where a particular item is selected
   by pressing the associated number on the dial pad.  All user key
   presses must be routed through the XML component layer.  The display
   layer either consumes the key presses or passes them on to the phone
   layer for consumption.

   The code handling key presses should thus present a key press to the
   display code first.  If the display code does not "use" the key
   press, then the key press should be presented to the phone code.
   This gives precedence to the XML scripts for key presses.

5.2 XML Requests

   The XML framework uses MGCP as its transport for making requests to
   the display phone.  MGCP is also used to receive asynchronous events
   from the display phone (e.g., an item has been selected, or the user
   has entered text).

   An XML request is made to an endpoint using the XML/xml signal.  The
   signal has the following format:

   S: XML/xml(<url>?<card>?$<variable1>=<value1>?$<variable2>=<value2>)

   The first component of the signal parameter is a URL to the deck.  If
   no scheme is indicated, the deck is assumed to be local to the phone.
   Here are some examples:

   ftp://server.company.com/deck1?card1?$var1=val1
   http://www.company.com/deck1?card1?$var1=val1
   file://deck1?card1?$var1=val1
   deck1?card1?$var1=val1

   A card identifier and a list of variable/value pairs follow the URL.
   The card identifier indicates the card within the deck to display.





Srinath, et al.              Informational                     [Page 13]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   The variable/value pairs are substituted into the deck before it is
   rendered to the display.  This means that the variables are deck-
   scoped, and variables not defined in the requested card must be
   populated in other cards in the same deck if defined therein.

   For example, a deck may contain the following cards:

   <card id="one">
   <p>$line1</p>
   <timer value="2"/>
   <do type="ontimer">
   <go href="#two"/>
   </do>
   </card>

   <card id="two">
   <p>$line2</p>
   </card>

   And an XML request may look like:

   S: XML/xml(deck?one?$line1=abc$line2=xyz)

   After variable substitution, the deck will look like:

   <card id="one">
   <p>abc</p>
   </card>

   <card id="two">
   <p>$line2</p>
   </card>

   Once variable substitution is complete, the card is rendered.  If a
   parameter variable does not exist anywhere in the deck it should be
   ignored.

   When card two is invoked from card1 in response to the timeout
   action, card two's variables are substituted with the variables
   values passed as a request to card one.  Card two will look like:

   <card id="two">
   <p>xyz</p>
   </card>

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


5.3 XML Request History

   In order to support navigation through a request history such as when
   a user cancels a card, the XML layer must maintain a last-in-first-
   out history of requests made for the endpoint.  (See the <prev> tag
   definition in section 5.5.13.)

5.4 XML Events

   Whenever the XML layer determines that an event has occurred, it
   reports the event using the MGCP observed event field:

   O:
   XML/xml(post?<deck>?<card>?<variable1>=<value1>?<variable2>=<value2>)

   Here, the event parameter contains the deck and card that generated
   the event, as well as data that is to be processed by the Call Agent.
   The data being posted is in the form of a list of variable/value
   pairs.

   In order for the Gateway to properly generate the XML event, it is
   necessary for the Call Agent to request the event using the requested
   events field:

   R: XML/xml

   This requested event should be combined with the signal request in an
   RQNT.

5.5 XML Tags

   Any XML implementation must at a minimum support the XML tags listed
   in the table that follows.  All tags have a terminator tag of the
   form </tag> to indicate the end of the tag.  See the XML grammar in
   Appendix A.

|               |                     | decrement the time until it   |
|               |                     | reaches zero at which point   |
|               |                     | the <do> tag is consulted.    |
|_______________|_____________________|_______________________________|

5.5.11 Do Tag

   The <do> tag indicates an action to be performed when the specified
   event occurs.

   Currently, the <do> tag can process three events: prev, ontimer and
   accept.  The prev event indicates that the user has requested to
   cancel the current card.

   The ontimer event indicates that the timer defined using the <timer>
   tag has expired.

   The accept event indicates that the user has completed inputting from
   the keypad.

   This tag has the following attributes:
 _______________ _____________________ _______________________________
|Attribute Name | Values (default)    | Usage                         |
|_______________|_____________________|_______________________________|
|Type           | Enum:               | Indicates the event on which  |
|               | prev/ontimer/accept | the tag operates.             |
|_______________|_____________________|_______________________________|

5.5.12 Go Tag

   The <go> tag is used in conjunction with the <do> tag to specify a
   URL to be loaded when the event occurs.

   This tag has the following attributes:

Appendix B:  Sample XML Documents, Renderings and Events

   This section presents some sample XML documents and details how they
   are translated to a business phone with a simple LCD display.

B.1 Sample Deck 1 (Itemized List Box)

   Below is a simple deck containing one card that defines a simple main
   menu interface using an itemized list box:

   <xml>
   <card id="home">
   <p mode="nowrap">$dn <time align="right"></time>
   <select type="item" name="Menu" iname="StrMenu">
   <option value="1" onpick="post?%deck?%id?%name=%value">MENU</option>
   </select>
   </p>
   </card>
   </xml>

   The card (home) contains three components:

      1. A paragraph (<p>).  The paragraph contains a variable ($dn)
         that shows the phone's extension.
      2. A clock (<time>).  The clock is aligned to the right.
      3. An itemized list (<select>) containing one item (MENU).

   An XML request for this deck and card might look like:

   S: XML/xml(deck?home?$dn=2344)

   After variable substitution, the phone may render the XML to the
   display as follows:

   --------------------
   |2344         11:59|
   | MENU             |
   --------------------
     [XX]  [XX]  [XX]



Srinath, et al.              Informational                     [Page 27]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   Here, MENU maps to the first soft key below the display.  If the user
   presses the first soft key, the following event will be generated:

   O: XML/xml(post?basic?home?Menu=1).

B.2 Sample Deck 2 (Enumerated List Box)

   The next sample deck defines a simple enumerated list box card:

   <xml>
   <card id="gelist">
   <p>$title
   <select name="x-name" iname="x-iname">
   <option value="$value1"
   onpick="post?%deck?%id?%name=%value?%iname=%x-iname">$opt1
   </option>
   <option value="$value2"
   onpick="post?%deck?%id?%name=%value?%iname=%x-iname">$opt2
   </option>
   <option value="$value3"
   onpick="post?%deck?%id?%name=%value?%iname=%x-iname">$opt3
   </option>
   <option value="$value4"
   onpick="post?%deck?%id?%name=%value?%iname=%x-iname">$opt4
   </option>
   <option value="$value5"
   onpick="post?%deck?%id?%name=%value?%iname=%x-iname">$opt5
   </option>
   </select>
   </p>
   <do type="prev">
   <prev></prev>
   </do>
   </card>
   </xml>

   The card (gelist) contains four components:

      1. A paragraph (<p>).  The paragraph contains a title variable
         describing the list contents.
      2. An enumerated list (<select>) containing five items.  When an
         item is selected, the XML layer sends the XML/xml event to the
         Call Agent.
      3. A do tag (<do>) indicating that when a "previous" event has
         occurred, to go to the previous page (<prev>).






Srinath, et al.              Informational                     [Page 28]

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   An XML request for this deck and card might look like:

   S: XML/xml(list?gelist?$title=Select a Car?
   $value1=Item1?$opt1=Porsche?
   $value2=Item2?$opt2=Chevrolet?
   $value3=Item3?$opt3=Toyota?
   $value4=Item4?$opt4=Daewoo?
   $value5=Item5?$opt5=Yugo)

   After variable substitution, the phone may render the XML to the
   display as follows:

   --------------------
   |SELECT A CAR      |
   |1. Porsche       v|
   --------------------
     [XX]  [XX]  [XX]

   Here, the display may be scrolled to reveal the additional items that
   may be selected and the keypad '1', '2', etc may be used to select
   the item.  These details are phone-specific.  For instance, on a
   larger 4-line display containing navigation keys, the XML may be
   rendered as follows:

   --------------------
   |SELECT A CAR      |
   |=>Porsche<=       |
   |  Chevrolet       |
   |  Toyota         v|
   --------------------

   When the user selects item 1, the following message will be sent to
   the Call Agent:

   O: XML/xml(post?list?gelist?x-name=Item1?x-iname=1)

B.3 Sample Deck 3 (Text Box)

   This sample shows how to implement a simple text box:

   <xml>
   <card id="generic">
   <p>$cldpty</p>
   <p>CALL FAILED</p>
   </card>

   The card (generic) contains two paragraphs.  The absence of a
   selectable list, input box or echo box indicates that this is a text
   box.

   An XML request for this deck and card might look like:

   S: XML/xml(deck?generic?$cldpty=John Doe)

   After variable substitution, the phone may render the XML to the
   display as follows:

   --------------------
   |JOHN DOE          |
   |CALL FAILED       |
   --------------------
     [XX]  [XX]  [XX]

B.4 Sample Deck 4 (Echo Box)

   This sample show how to implement a simple echo box.  The XML layer
   does not consume any keystrokes.

   <xml>
   <card id="getdigits">
   <p>Dial Number:</p>
   <echo mode="$mode" align="left"/>
   </card>
   </xml>

   The card (getdigits) contains a paragraph of text and an echo box.

   An XML request for this deck and card might look like:

   S: XML/xml(deck?getdigits?$mode=on)

   After variable substitution, the phone may render the XML to the
   display as follows:

   --------------------
   |DIAL NUMBER:      |
   |                  |
   --------------------
     [XX]  [XX]  [XX]

   All user input is displayed but not consumed by the XML layer.

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


B.5 Sample Deck 5 (Input Box)

   This sample implements a basic input box:

   <xml>
   <card id="ginput">
   <p>$title
   <input name="x-name"/>
   </p>
   <do type="accept">
   <go href="post?%deck?%id?%name=%value"/>
   </do>
   <do type="prev">
   <prev></prev>
   </do>
   </card>
   </xml>

   The card (ginput) contains:

      1. A paragraph <p>.  The paragraph contains a title.
      2. An input box <input>.  The input box consumes keypad events and
         reports them when input is complete.
      3. Two event handlers <do>.  The first handles the accept event.
         This event indicates that the user has completed keypad input
         and posts an observed event to the Call Agent.  The second
         handles the prev event.  This event indicates that the user has
         requested to revert back to the previous card.

   An XML request for this deck and card might look like:

   S: XML/xml(deck?ginput?$title=Enter Digits:)

   After variable substitution, the phone may render the XML to the
   display as follows:

   --------------------
   |ENTER DIGITS:     |
   |_                 |
   --------------------
     [XX]  [XX]  [XX]

   It is up to the individual business phone implementation to determine
   which soft keys or keypad keys map to functions such as "backspace",
   "reset line", etc.

B.6 Sample Deck 6 (Timers)

   To illustrate timers and deck-scoped variable substitution, a two-
   card deck is provided:

   <xml>
   <card id="connected1">
   <timer value="$tvalue"/>
   <p mode="nowrap">$cldpty
   <select type="item" name="x-name" iname="x-iname">
   <option value="1"
   onpick="post?TRNSINIT">TRNS
   </option>
   <option value="2"
   onpick="post?CONFINIT">CONF
   </option>
   <option value="3"
   onpick="post?%deck?%card?%name=%value">MENU
   </option>
   </select>
   </p>
   <do type="ontimer">
   <go href="#connected2"/>
   </do>
   </card>

   <card id="connected2">
   <p mode="nowrap">
   <calltimer value="$calltimer" align="right"/>
   <select type="item" name="x-name">
   <option value="1"
   onpick="post?TRNSINIT">TRNS
   </option>
   <option value="2"
   onpick="post?CONFINIT">CONF
   </option>
   <option value="3"
   onpick="post?%deck?%card?%name=%value" >MENU
   </option>
   </select>
   </p>
   </card>
   </xml>

   In this example, when the timer expires in card connected1, it
   generates an ontimer event.  This event is consumed by the <do> tag
   and causes the XML layer to load card with the identifier connected2.

RFC 3149              MGCP Business Phone Packages        September 2001


   An XML request for these cards might look like:

   S: XML/xml(deck?connected1?$tvalue=00:00:05?$cldpty=John
   Doe?$calltimer=00:00:00)

   And might be rendered as:

   --------------------
   |JOHN DOE          |
   | TRNS  CONF  MENU |
   --------------------
     [XX]  [XX]  [XX]

   Once the timer expires, the XML layer loads the referenced page:

   --------------------
   |          00:00:05|
   | TRNS  CONF  MENU |
   --------------------
     [XX]  [XX]  [XX]

Appendix C: Example usage of MGCP extension packages
