          Network Time Protocol Version 4: Port Randomization

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) can operate in several modes.  Some
   of these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets and
   therefore require the use of a well-known port as the local port.
   However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a well-known port
   is not required, employing such a well-known port unnecessarily
   facilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path
   attacks.  This document formally updates RFC 5905, recommending the
   use of transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization for those
   modes where use of the NTP well-known port is not required.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest Internet
   protocols and is currently specified in [RFC5905].  Since its
   original implementation, standardization, and deployment, a number of
   vulnerabilities have been found both in the NTP specification and in
   some of its implementations [NTP-VULN].  Some of these
   vulnerabilities allow for blind/off-path attacks, where an attacker
   can send forged packets to one or both NTP peers to achieve Denial of
   Service (DoS), time shifts, or other undesirable outcomes.  Many of
   these attacks require the attacker to guess or know at least a target
   NTP association, typically identified by the tuple {srcaddr, srcport,
   dstaddr, dstport, keyid} (see Section 9.1 of [RFC5905]).  Some of
   these parameters may be known or easily guessed.

   NTP can operate in several modes.  Some of these modes rely on the
   ability of nodes to receive unsolicited packets and therefore require
   the use of the NTP well-known port (123).  However, for modes where
   the use of a well-known port is not required, employing the NTP well-
   known port unnecessarily facilitates the ability of attackers to
   perform blind/off-path attacks (since knowledge of the port numbers
   is typically required for such attacks).  A recent study [NIST-NTP]
   that analyzes the port numbers employed by NTP clients suggests that
   numerous NTP clients employ the NTP well-known port as their local
   port, or select predictable ephemeral port numbers, thus
   unnecessarily facilitating the ability of attackers to perform blind/
   off-path attacks against NTP.

   BCP 156 [RFC6056] already recommends the randomization of transport-
   protocol ephemeral ports.  This document aligns NTP with the
   recommendation in BCP 156 [RFC6056] by formally updating [RFC5905]
   such that port randomization is employed for those NTP modes for
   which the use of the NTP well-known port is not needed.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Considerations about Port Randomization in NTP

   The following subsections analyze a number of considerations about
   transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization when applied to NTP.

3.1.  Mitigation against Off-Path Attacks

   There has been a fair share of work in the area of blind/off-path
   attacks against transport protocols and upper-layer protocols, such
   as [RFC4953] and [RFC5927].  Whether the target of the attack is a
   transport-protocol instance (e.g., TCP connection) or an upper-layer
   protocol instance (e.g., an application-protocol instance), the
   attacker is required to know or guess the five-tuple {Protocol, IP
   Source Address, IP Destination Address, Source Port, Destination
   Port} that identifies the target transport-protocol instance or the
   transport-protocol instance employed by the target upper-layer
   protocol instance.  Therefore, increasing the difficulty of guessing
   this five-tuple helps mitigate blind/off-path attacks.

   As a result of these considerations, transport-protocol ephemeral
   port randomization is a best current practice (BCP 156) that helps
   mitigate off-path attacks at the transport layer.  This document
   aligns the NTP specification [RFC5905] with the existing best current
   practice on transport-protocol ephemeral port selection, irrespective
   of other techniques that may (and should) be implemented for
   mitigating off-path attacks.

   We note that transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization is a
   transport-layer mitigation against blind/off-path attacks and does
   not preclude (nor is it precluded by) other possible mitigations for
   off-path attacks that might be implemented at other layers (e.g.,
   [NTP-DATA-MINIMIZATION]).  For instance, some of the aforementioned
   mitigations may be ineffective against some off-path attacks
   [NTP-FRAG] or may benefit from the additional entropy provided by
   port randomization [NTP-security].

3.2.  Effects on Path Selection

   Intermediate systems implementing the Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP)
   algorithm may select the outgoing link by computing a hash over a
   number of values, including the transport-protocol source port.
   Thus, as discussed in [NTP-CHLNG], the selected client port may have
   an influence on the measured offset and delay.

   If the source port is changed with each request, packets in different
   exchanges will be more likely to take different paths, which could
   cause the measurements to be less stable and have a negative impact
   on the stability of the clock.

   Network paths to/from a given server are less likely to change
   between requests if port randomization is applied on a per-
   association basis.  This approach minimizes the impact on the
   stability of NTP measurements, but it may cause different clients in
   the same network synchronized to the same NTP server to have a
   significant stable offset between their clocks.  This is due to their
   NTP exchanges consistently taking different paths with different
   asymmetry in the network delay.

   Section 4 recommends that NTP implementations randomize the ephemeral
   port number of client/server associations.  The choice of whether to
   randomize the port number on a per-association or a per-request basis
   is left to the implementation.

3.3.  Filtering of NTP Traffic

   In a number of scenarios (such as when mitigating DDoS attacks), a
   network operator may want to differentiate between NTP requests sent
   by clients and NTP responses sent by NTP servers.  If an
   implementation employs the NTP well-known port for the client port,
   requests/responses cannot be readily differentiated by inspecting the
   source and destination port numbers.  Implementation of port
   randomization for nonsymmetrical modes allows for simple
   differentiation of NTP requests and responses and for the enforcement
   of security policies that may be valuable for the mitigation of DDoS
   attacks, when all NTP clients in a given network employ port
   randomization.

3.4.  Effect on NAPT Devices

   Some NAPT devices will reportedly not translate the source port of a
   packet when a system port number (i.e., a port number in the range
   0-1023) [RFC6335] is employed.  In networks where such NAPT devices
   are employed, use of the NTP well-known port for the client port may
   limit the number of hosts that may successfully employ NTP client
   implementations at any given time.

      |  NOTES:
      |  
      |     NAPT devices are defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC2663].
      |  
      |     The reported behavior is similar to the special treatment of
      |     UDP port 500, which has been documented in Section 2.3 of
      |     [RFC3715].

   In the case of NAPT devices that will translate the source port even
   when a system port is employed, packets reaching the external realm
   of the NAPT will not employ the NTP well-known port as the source
   port, as a result of the port translation function being performed by
   the NAPT device.

4.  Update to RFC 5905

   The following text from Section 9.1 (Peer Process Variables) of
   [RFC5905]:

   |  dstport:  UDP port number of the client, ordinarily the NTP port
   |     number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  This becomes the
   |     source port number in packets sent from this association.

   is replaced with:

   |  dstport:  UDP port number of the client.  In the case of broadcast
   |     server mode (5) and symmetric modes (1 and 2), it SHOULD
   |     contain the NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by IANA.  In
   |     the client mode (3), it SHOULD contain a randomized port
   |     number, as specified in [RFC6056].  The value in this variable
   |     becomes the source port number of packets sent from this
   |     association.  The randomized port number SHOULD NOT be shared
   |     with other associations, to avoid revealing the randomized port
   |     to other associations.
   |  
   |     If a client implementation performs transport-protocol
   |     ephemeral port randomization on a per-request basis, it SHOULD
   |     close the corresponding socket/port after each request/response
   |     exchange.  In order to prevent duplicate or delayed server
   |     packets from eliciting ICMP port unreachable error messages
   |     [RFC0792] [RFC4443] at the client, the client MAY wait for more
   |     responses from the server for a specific period of time (e.g.,
   |     3 seconds) before closing the UDP socket/port.
   |  
   |   
   |        NOTES:
   |  
   |        Randomizing the ephemeral port number on a per-request basis
   |        will better mitigate blind/off-path attacks, particularly if
   |        the socket/port is closed after each request/response
   |        exchange, as recommended above.  The choice of whether to
   |        randomize the ephemeral port number on a per-request or a
   |        per-association basis is left to the implementation, and it
   |        should consider the possible effects on path selection along
   |        with its possible impact on time measurement.
   |  
   |        On most current operating systems, which implement ephemeral
   |        port randomization [RFC6056], an NTP client may normally
   |        rely on the operating system to perform ephemeral port
   |        randomization.  For example, NTP implementations using POSIX
   |        sockets may achieve ephemeral port randomization by _not_
   |        binding the socket with the bind() function or binding it to
   |        port 0, which has a special meaning of "any port".  Using
   |        the connect() function for the socket will make the port
   |        inaccessible by other systems (that is, only packets from
   |        the specified remote socket will be received by the
   |        application).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security implications of predictable numeric identifiers
   [PEARG-NUMERIC-IDS] (and of predictable transport-protocol port
   numbers [RFC6056] in particular) have been known for a long time now.
   However, the NTP specification has traditionally followed a pattern
   of employing common settings even when not strictly necessary, which
   at times has resulted in negative security and privacy implications
   (see, e.g., [NTP-DATA-MINIMIZATION]).  The use of the NTP well-known
   port (123) for the srcport and dstport variables is not required for
   all operating modes.  Such unnecessary usage comes at the expense of
   reducing the amount of work required for an attacker to successfully
   perform blind/off-path attacks against NTP.  Therefore, this document
   formally updates [RFC5905], recommending the use of transport-
   protocol port randomization when use of the NTP well-known port is
   not required.

   This issue has been assigned CVE-2019-11331 [VULN-REPORT] in the U.S.
   National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
