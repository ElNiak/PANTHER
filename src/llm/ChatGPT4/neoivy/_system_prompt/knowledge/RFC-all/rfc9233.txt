  Internationalized Domain Names for Applications 2008 (IDNA2008) and
                             Unicode 12.0.0

Abstract

   This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.0.0 and Unicode
   12.0.0 in the context of the current version of Internationalized
   Domain Names for Applications 2008 (IDNA2008).  Some additions and
   changes have been made in the Unicode Standard that affect the values
   produced by the algorithm IDNA2008 specifies.  IDNA2008 allows adding
   exceptions to the algorithm for backward compatibility; however, this
   document does not add any such exceptions.  This document provides
   the necessary tables to IANA to make its database consistent with
   Unicode 12.0.0.

   To improve understanding, this document describes systems that are
   being used as alternatives to those that conform to IDNA2008.

1.  Introduction

   The current version of Internationalized Domain Names for
   Applications (IDNA) was initiated in 2008, and despite not being
   completed until 2010, is widely known as "IDNA2008".  It is specified
   in the series of documents listed in Section 2.1.  The IDNA2008
   standard includes an algorithm by which a derived property value is
   calculated based on the properties defined in the Unicode Standard.

   The derived property values that can be calculated are defined in RFC
   5892 [RFC5892].  Below is a summary to aid in the reading of this
   document.  For definition of the terms, please see RFC 5892
   [RFC5892].

   PROTOCOL VALID:  Those that are allowed to be used in IDNs.  Code
      points with this property value are permitted for general use in
      IDNs.  However, the fact that a label consists only of code points
      with this property value does not imply that the label can be used
      in DNS.  The abbreviated term PVALID is used to refer to this
      value.

   CONTEXTUAL RULE REQUIRED:  Some characteristics of the character,
      such as it being invisible in certain contexts or problematic in
      others, require that it not be used in labels unless specific
      other characters or properties are present.  The abbreviated term
      CONTEXT is used to refer to this value.  As explained in RFC 5892
      [RFC5892], CONTEXT is in turn divided into CONTEXTJ and CONTEXTO.

   DISALLOWED:  Those that should clearly not be included in IDNs.  Code
      points with this property value are not permitted in IDNs.

   UNASSIGNED:  Those code points that are not designated (i.e., are
      unassigned) in the Unicode Standard.

   When the Unicode Standard is updated, new code points are assigned
   and already assigned code points can have their property values
   changed.

   *  Assigning code points can create problems if the newly assigned
      code points are compositions of existing code points and the
      normalization relationships associated with those code points
      should have been changed because of that.

   *  Changing properties for already assigned code points can create
      problems if the property change results in changes to the derived
      property value.  A previously allowed code point whose derived
      property value is PVALID may now be prohibited if its derived
      property value changes to DISALLOWED.  The problem can also happen
      the other way around: a code point that was not allowed (and thus
      was prohibited) can suddenly be allowed.

   *  Problems can also be created if the properties assigned to those
      code points are inconsistent with IDNA2008 assumptions about how
      properties are assigned and/or about how code points with those
      properties are used or behave.

   There were three incompatible changes in the Unicode Standard between
   Unicode 5.2.0 [Unicode-5.2.0] and Unicode 6.0.0 [Unicode-6.0.0]; they
   are described in RFC 6452 [RFC6452].  The code points U+0CF1 and
   U+0CF2 had a derived property value change from DISALLOWED to PVALID,
   and the code point U+19DA had a change in derived property value from
   PVALID to DISALLOWED.  These changes where examined in great detail,
   but the IETF concluded that these changes to the Unicode Standard did
   not warrant an update to RFC 5892 [RFC5892].

   As described in Section 3, more incompatible changes have been made
   to code points between Unicode 6.0.0 and Unicode 12.0.0
   [Unicode-12.0.0]; however, the changes in the derived property values
   do not result in exceptions (as defined in Section 2.6 of RFC 5892
   [RFC5892]) that would require an update to the "IDNA Contextual
   Rules" registry (which would also be considered an update to RFC 5892
   [RFC5892]).

   Further, in 2015, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) issued a
   statement [IAB2005-1] that advised the community to avoid using any
   of the potentially problematic code points and asked the IETF to
   resolve the issues related to the code point ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH
   HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) that was introduced in Unicode 7.0.0
   [Unicode-7.0.0].  In February of that year, the statement was revised
   [IAB2005-2] to focus on the latter request.  More details about the
   problem of code point sequences not normalizing as one might expect
   appear in a draft that was part of the discussion [IDNA7].

   The result of the work in the IETF was that no exception was added to
   RFC 5892 [RFC5892]; however, it should be noted that the review of
   the issues around U+08A1 indicated that this code point is not an
   isolated case and that a number of long-standing PVALID code points
   may have similar issues.  While the affected code points remain
   PVALID in this document, identification of the problem resulted in a
   clarification of the review process for new Unicode versions.  That
   clarification, which reinforces the original review plan to capture
   issues like these, was published as RFC 8753 [RFC8753].  Any review
   of Unicode versions after 12.0.0 should be made according to RFC 8753
   [RFC8753]; an objective of this document is to ensure that a proper
   review of such versions after version 12.0.0 can be made.

2.  Background

2.1.  IDNA2008 Documents

   IDNA2008 consists of the following documents.  The documents in the
   set have informal names.

   *  "Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA):
      Definitions and Document Framework" [RFC5890], informally called
      "Defs" or "Definitions", contains definitions and other material
      that are needed for understanding other documents in the set.

   *  "Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA): Protocol"
      [RFC5891], informally called "Protocol", describes the core
      IDNA2008 protocol and its operations.  It needs to be interpreted
      in combination with the Bidi document (described below).  RFC 5891
      [RFC5891] obsoletes RFC 3491 [RFC3491] and, in particular, the use
      of the tables to which RFC 3491 [RFC3491] refers.

   *  "The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized Domain Names for
      Applications (IDNA)" [RFC5892], informally called "Tables", lists
      the categories and rules that identify the code points allowed in
      a label written in native character form (called a "U-label"), and
      is based on Unicode 5.2.0 [Unicode-5.2.0] code point assignments
      and additional rules unique to IDNA2008.  The Unicode-based rules
      in RFC 5892 are expected to be stable across Unicode updates and
      hence independent of Unicode versions.

   *  "Right-to-Left Scripts for Internationalized Domain Names for
      Applications (IDNA)" [RFC5893], informally called "Bidi",
      specifies special rules for labels that contain characters that
      are written from right to left.

   *  "Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA):
      Background, Explanation, and Rationale" [RFC5894], informally
      called "Rationale", provides an overview of the protocol and
      associated tables, and gives explanatory material and some
      rationale for the decisions that led to IDNA2008.  It also
      contains advice for DNS registry operators and others who use
      Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).

   *  "Mapping Characters for Internationalized Domain Names in
      Applications (IDNA) 2008" [RFC5895], informally called "Mapping",
      discusses the issue of mapping characters into other characters
      and provides guidance for doing so when that is appropriate.  RFC
      5895 provides advice only and is not a required part of IDNA.

2.2.  Additional Important IDNA2008-Related Documents

   There are other documents important for the understanding and
   functioning of IDNA2008, for example this.

   *  "The Unicode Code Points and Internationalized Domain Names for
      Applications (IDNA) - Unicode 6.0" [RFC6452] describes some
      changes made to Unicode 6.0.0 [Unicode-6.0.0] that resulted in
      derived property value changes for the code points U+0CF1, U+0CF2,
      and U+19DA.  U+0CF1 and U+0CF2 changed from DISALLOWED to PVALID,
      while U+19DA changed from PVALID to DISALLOWED.  The IETF
      concluded that no update to RFC 5892 [RFC5892] was needed based on
      the changes made in Unicode 6.0.0 [Unicode-6.0.0].  As a result,
      the derived property value remained aligned with the Unicode
      Standard.  Specifically, no exception was added.

2.3.  Deployment

   There are many variations on the general IDNA model in use in the
   various parts of the community.  The following lists some of the
   strategies that implementations that claim to be IDNA compliant are
   known to use, but it should be noted the list is not complete:

   *  IDNA2003 as specified in RFC 3490 [RFC3490] and RFC 3491
      [RFC3491].  Those specifications are dependent on case folding,
      Normalization Form KC (NFKC), and on tables that specify for each
      code point whether it is allowed to be used or not, with a
      distinction made between use for "stored strings" and "query
      strings".  The tables themselves are dependent on Unicode 3.2
      [Unicode-3.2.0].

   *  A number of variations on IDNA2003, sometimes presented as
      "updated IDNA2003" or the like, which follow the principles of
      IDNA2003 as understood by the implementers but that use tables
      that represent how the implementers believe Stringprep [RFC3454]
      and Nameprep [RFC3491] would have evolved had the IETF not moved
      in the direction of IDNA2008 instead.

   *  A mix between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 where code points assigned to
      Unicode after Unicode 3.2.0 [Unicode-3.2.0] have derived property
      value calculated according to the algorithm specified in IDNA2008.

   *  A mix between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 according to the Unicode
      Technical Standard #46 [UTS-46].  Because that document specifies
      different profiles, there are several variations that leave users
      with no guarantee that two applications claiming conformance to
      UTS#46 will interoperate well with each other much less with
      conforming IDNA2008 implementations.  UTS#46 is ultimately based
      on a normative table very much like the one used by Stringprep
      [RFC3454] but updated for each new version of Unicode.

   *  The (normative) IDNA2008 algorithm applied to whatever version of
      Unicode Standard exists in the operating system and/or libraries
      used, independent of whatever version of tables appears in the
      (non-normative) IANA database.

   In practice, the Unicode Consortium creates a maximum set of code
   points by assigning code points in the Unicode Standard.  The
   IDNA2008 rules use the Unicode Standard to create a further subset of
   code points and context that are permitted in DNS labels associated
   with its PVALID and CONTEXT (CONTEXTJ or CONTEXTO) derived property
   values.  DNS registries and other organizations that deal with IDNs
   are supposed to create their own subsets from IDNA2008 for use by
   those registries and organizations.

   This progressive subsetting and narrowing of the repertoire of code
   points that can be used in labels is an implementation of the
   principles of being conservative when deciding what code points to
   include in such a subset.  SAC-084 [SAC-084] and RFC 6912 [RFC6912]
   recommend to DNS registries and other organizations to be
   conservative when creating their subsets and to use the principle of
   creating subsets by inclusion.

   See also Security Considerations (Section 7) in this document.

3.  Notable Changes between Unicode 6.0.0 and 12.0.0

   Among the changes between the Unicode versions, most code points that
   change derived property value change from UNASSIGNED to PVALID or
   from UNASSIGNED to DISALLOWED.  The interesting changes in derived
   property values include other changes.  All changes between the major
   versions of Unicode can be found in Appendix A (6.0.0-7.0.0),
   Appendix B (7.0.0-8.0.0), Appendix C (8.0.0-9.0.0), Appendix D
   (9.0.0-10.0.0), Appendix E (10.0.0-11.0.0), and Appendix F
   (11.0.0-12.0.0).

3.1.  Changes between Unicode 6.0.0 and 7.0.0

   Change in number of characters in each category:

   *  PVALID changed from 97418 to 99867 (+2449)

   *  UNASSIGNED changed from 865081 to 861509 (-3572)

   *  CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

   *  CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

   *  DISALLOWED changed from 151586 to 152709 (+1123)

   *  TOTAL did not change, at 1114112

   There are no changes made to Unicode between version 6.0.0 and 7.0.0
   that impact IDNA2008 calculation of the derived property values.

   The code points U+17B4 KHMER VOWEL INHERENT AQ and U+17B5 KHMER VOWEL
   INHERENT AA both changed the General Category from Cf (Format) to Mn
   (Nonspacing_Mark), but that did not impact the calculation of the
   derived property value which stayed at DISALLOWED.

   The character ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) was
   introduced in Unicode 7.0.0.  This was discussed extensively in the
   IETF and also by the IAB in their statement [IAB2005-1] requesting
   the IETF to investigate the issue.  Specifically, the IAB stated:

   |  On the same precautionary principle, the IAB recommends that the
   |  Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) Parameters
   |  registry <https://www.iana.org/assignments/idna-tables/> not be
   |  updated to Unicode 7.0.0 until the IETF has consensus on a
   |  solution to this problem.

   The discussion in the IETF concluded that although it is possible to
   create "the same" character in multiple ways, the issue with U+08A1
   is not unique.  The character U+08A1 (ARABIC LETTER BEH WITH HAMZA
   ABOVE) can be represented with the sequence ARABIC LETTER BEH
   (U+0628) and ARABIC HAMZA ABOVE (U+0654).  This is identical to LATIN
   SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE (U+00F8), which can be represented with
   the sequence LATIN SMALL LETTER O (U+006F) followed by COMBINING
   SHORT SOLIDUS OVERLAY (U+0337).

   Although the discussion about this specific code point resulted in
   acceptance of the derived property value of PVALID, the underlying
   problem with combining sequences is not understood fully.  Therefore,
   it cannot be claimed that this case can be extrapolated to other
   situations and other code points.

3.2.  Changes between Unicode 7.0.0 and 10.0.0

   Change in number of characters in each category:

   *  Code points that changed derived property value: 0

   *  PVALID changed from 99867 to 122411 (+22544)

   *  UNASSIGNED changed from 861509 to 837775 (-23734)

   *  CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

   *  CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

   *  DISALLOWED changed from 152709 to 153899 (+1190)

   *  TOTAL did not change, at 1114112

   There are no changes made to Unicode between version 7.0.0 and 10.0.0
   that impact IDNA2008 calculation of the derived property values.

3.3.  Changes between Unicode 10.0.0 and 11.0.0

   Change in number of characters in each category:

   *  Code points that changed derived property value: 1

   *  PVALID changed from 122411 to 122734 (+323)

   *  UNASSIGNED changed from 837775 to 837091 (-684)

   *  CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

   *  CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

   *  DISALLOWED changed from 153899 to 154260 (+361)

   *  TOTAL did not change, at 1114112

   *  Georgian letters in the ranges U+10D0..U+10FA and U+10FD..U+10FF
      had their General Category changed from Lo (Other_Letter) to Ll
      (Lowercase_Letter) to reflect their status as the lowercase of new
      Georgian case pairs.  Case mappings were also added.

   *  SHARADA SANDHI MARK (U+111C9) General Category was changed from Po
      (Other_Punctuation) to Mn (Nonspacing_Mark), and the Bidi property
      was changed from L (Left to Right) to NSM (Nonspacing Mark).

   *  The properties for ZANABAZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AI (U+11A07) and
      ZANABAZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AU (U+11A08) were corrected from Mc to
      Mn.

   *  SPHERICAL ANGLE OPENING UP (U+29A1) was changed to Bidi Mirrored
      to No.

   These changes to the Unicode Standard have the following implications
   for these code points:

   *  The newly assigned 684 characters are assigned a derived property
      value as of a result of applying the IDNA2008 algorithm.

   *  The Georgian letters in the ranges U+10D0..U+10FA and
      U+10FD..U+10FF existed before IDNA2008 was created.  Applying the
      IDNA2008 algorithm to the code points assigned the derived
      property value PVALID, and that value is unchanged even if the
      underlying Unicode properties have changed.  The newly encoded
      Mtavruli letters have General Category Lu (Uppercase_Letter) and
      are therefore DISALLOWED.

   *  The U+111C9 SHARADA SANDHI MARK was added to Unicode 8.0.0
      [Unicode-8.0.0].  Applying the IDNA2008 algorithm to the code
      point assigned the derived property value DISALLOWED.  The changes
      in the underlying properties in Unicode 11.0.0 [Unicode-11.0.0]
      caused the derived property value to change to PVALID.

   *  The characters ZANABAZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AI (U+11A07) and
      ZANABAZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AU (U+11A08) were added to Unicode
      10.0.0 [Unicode-10.0.0].  Applying the IDNA2008 algorithm to the
      code points assigned the derived property value PVALID, and that
      value is unchanged even if the underlying Unicode properties have
      changed.

   *  SPHERICAL ANGLE OPENING UP (U+29A1) existed before IDNA2008 was
      created.  Applying the IDNA2008 algorithm to the code point
      assigned the derived property value DISALLOWED, and that value is
      unchanged even if the underlying Unicode properties have changed.

3.4.  Changes between Unicode 11.0.0 and 12.0.0

   Change in number of characters in each category:

   *  Code points that changed derived property value: 0

   *  PVALID changed from 122734 to 123006 (+272)

   *  UNASSIGNED changed from 837091 to 836537 (-554)

   *  CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

   *  CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

   *  DISALLOWED changed from 154260 to 154542 (+282)

   *  TOTAL did not change, at 1114112

4.  U+111C9 SHARADA SANDHI MARK

   As one can see in Section 3, an incompatible property change was made
   between Unicode 6.0.0 and 12.0.0, affecting the code point U+111C9.
   Its derived property value thus changed from DISALLOWED to PVALID.
   In situations like these, IDNA2008 allows for addition of rules to
   RFC 5892 [RFC5892], Section 2.7.  If the code point is accepted, it
   might still be rejected if validated by software based on versions of
   Unicode older than 12.0.0.  As the character is rarely used outside
   the group of Sharada specialists but is used in some records for
   indicating sandhi breaks, the conclusion was that it could either be
   added as an exception or allowed to change its property value.  As
   including an exception would require implementation changes to
   deployments of IDNA20008, the IETF has decided not to add a
   BackwardCompatible rule to IDNA2008 (i.e., Section 2.7 of RFC 5892
   [RFC5892]) for this code point.  This also ensures all sandhi marks
   are treated equally.

5.  Conclusion

   As described in Sections 3 and 4, changes have been made to Unicode
   between version 6.0.0 and 12.0.0.  Some changes to specific
   characters changed their derived property value, whereas other
   changes did not.  Given the deployment considerations described in
   Section 2.3 and changes in the Unicode Standard described in Sections
   3 and 4, including implications to normalization, the conclusion is
   not to add any exception rules to IDNA2008.

   This document addresses only changes to Unicode between version 6.0.0
   and version 12.0.0.  Changes in future Unicode versions might result
   in the conclusion that exception rules need to be added to IDNA2008
   after the review process explained in RFC 8753 [RFC8753].  Separately
   from any changes in Unicode, the IETF might conclude that updates to
   RFC 5892 [RFC5892] or other IDNA2008 documents might become
   necessary; such updates might include changes to the algorithm
   specified in IDNA2008 as well as additional rules, categories, or
   other forms of tuning, like the clarifications in RFC 8753 [RFC8753].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA updated the "IDNA Rules and Derived Property Values" [IANA-IDNA]
   registry after the expert reviewer validated that the derived
   property values were calculated correctly.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document makes recommendations regarding the use of the IDNA2008
   algorithm for calculation of derived property values, based on
   Unicode version 12.0.0.  This recommendation does not say anything
   about what recommendations to make for future versions of the Unicode
   Standard.

   Not following these recommendations can lead to various security
   issues.  Specifically, allowing confusable characters may lead to
   various phishing attacks, as described in the Security Consideration
   Sections in the documents listed in Section 2.1.
