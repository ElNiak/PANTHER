                     Prohibiting RC4 Cipher Suites

Abstract

   This document requires that Transport Layer Security (TLS) clients
   and servers never negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites when they
   establish connections.  This applies to all TLS versions.  This
   document updates RFCs 5246, 4346, and 2246.

1.  Introduction

   RC4 is a stream cipher that is described in [SCH]; it is widely
   supported, and often preferred by TLS servers.  However, RC4 has long
   been known to have a variety of cryptographic weaknesses, e.g., see
   [PAU], [MAN], and [FLU].  Recent cryptanalysis results [ALF] exploit
   biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted
   plaintexts.

   These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically
   exploitable; currently, they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30
   encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a
   sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.

   This document requires that TLS ([RFC5246] [RFC4346] [RFC2246])
   clients and servers never negotiate the use of RC4 cipher suites.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Changes to TLS

   Because of the RC4 deficiencies noted in Section 1, the following
   apply:

   o  TLS clients MUST NOT include RC4 cipher suites in the ClientHello
      message.

   o  TLS servers MUST NOT select an RC4 cipher suite when a TLS client
      sends such a cipher suite in the ClientHello message.

   o  If the TLS client only offers RC4 cipher suites, the TLS server
      MUST terminate the handshake.  The TLS server MAY send the
      insufficient_security fatal alert in this case.

   Appendix A lists the RC4 cipher suites defined for TLS.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document helps maintain the security guarantees of the TLS
   protocol by prohibiting the use of the RC4-based cipher suites
   (listed in Appendix A), which do not provide a sufficiently high
   level of security.
