1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used by IEEE 802.5 end-
   stations for managing source routes on a Token Ring network where
   IEEE source-routing is in use.  IEEE source-routing is described in
   802.5 Token Ring Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications [8]
   and related ISO publications [9, 10, 11].

   This memo is an incremental update to RFC 1748 [6].  It is documented
   separately from the RFC 1748 solely due to the latter's maturity
   within the Internet standardization process.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      o    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Overview

   This memo defines a single table: the 802.5 Station Source Routing
   Table, which contains the source routes known by a end-station on an
   IEEE 802.5 Token Ring network in which IEEE source-routing is in use.

3.1.  Source Routing

   Source routing extends the 802.5 protocol [8] by assigning a unique
   ring number to each ring within the extended LAN, and a bridge number
   to each source routing bridge's connection to a ring.  A Routing
   Information Field (RIF) must be included in frames which need to
   traverse multiple rings.  The format of the RIF is:

     * Note that the length of the Maximum frame length subfield
       has recently been extended to 6 bits.

   The format of each Routing Descriptor (RD) field is:

                     octet 1         octet 2

                             bridge number --+

3.2.  Relationship to RFC 1748

   RFC 1748 [6], the IEEE 802.5 MIB, defines managed objects used for
   interfaces to IEEE 802.5 Token Ring subnetworks.  This memo is an
   incremental update to RFC 1748, and is documented independently
   solely due to the maturity of the definitions contained within RFC
   1748.

3.3.  Relationship to RFC 1525

   RFC 1525 [7] defines the MIB objects specific to source-routing for
   source-routing and SRT bridges.  This memo defines the MIB objects
   specific to source-routing for source-routing end-stations.

RFC 1749      802.5 Station Source Routing MIB using SMIv2 December 1994


3.4.  Static Source Routes

   It is unclear how many, if any, existing systems allow the creation
   or deletion of "static" 802.5 source routes by network management.
   However, SNMPv2 SMI defines that the MAX-ACCESS clause as specifying
   the maximal level of access which makes "protocol sense".  Thus, this
   memo provides support for static source routes through the
   dot5SrRouteStatus object, but the conformance statements allow for
   stations which do not support static source routes, by requiring that
   compliant agents only need provide read-access to dot5SrRouteStatus.

3.5.  Destinations on the Local Ring

   Entries should be included in the dot5SrRouteTable for destination
   MAC addresses which are on the same ring as the instrumented 802.5
   interface.  For such entries, dot5SrRouteDescr has the value of the
   zero-length string, and dot5SrRouteControl has the corresponding
   value.

   The need for this MIB module was agreed upon by the members of the
   IETF Interfaces Working Group, and the definitions were derived from
   experience with enterprise-specific MIBs presented to the Working
