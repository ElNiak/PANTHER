Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace that
   will identify various objects within the Liberty Architecture for
   federated network identity.

1.  Introduction

   The Liberty Architecture seeks to provide federated network identity
   in such a way that enhances security, privacy and trust; thus
   creating a networked world across which individuals and businesses
   can engage in virtually any transaction without compromising the
   privacy and security of vital identity information.

   One fundamental component of this architecture is its use of XML [5],
   and specifically, XML Schema [7] and Namespaces [6].  These
   components require identifiers that will live far beyond the lifetime
   of the organization that produced them.  As such, a URN namespace for
   those components that adheres to the assumptions and policies of the
   Liberty specification is required.

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

2.  Specification Template

   Namespace ID:

      "liberty" requested.

   Registration Information:

      Registration Version Number: 1

      Registration Date: 2003-04-01

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

   Declaration of structure:

      The Namespace Specific Strings (NSS) of all URNs assigned by
      Liberty will conform to the syntax defined in section 2.2 of RFC
      2141 [1].  In addition, all Liberty URN NSSs will consist of a
      left-to-right series of tokens delimited by colons.  The left-to-
      right sequence of colon-delimited tokens corresponds to descending
      nodes in a tree.  To the right of the lowest naming authority node
      there may be zero, one or more levels of hierarchical (although
      not in the RFC 2396 [2] sense of 'hierarchy') naming nodes
      terminating in a rightmost leaf node.  See the section entitled
      "Identifier assignment" below for more on the semantics of NSSs.
      This syntax convention is captured in the following normative ABNF
      [4] rules for Liberty NSSs:

      Liberty-NSS        =   1*(subStChar) 0*(":" 1*(subStChar))
      subStChar       =   trans / "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG
      trans           =   ALPHA / DIGIT / other / reserved
      other           =   "(" / ")" / "+" / "," / "-" / "." /
                          "=" / "@" / ";" / "$" /
                          "_" / "!" / "*" / "'"
      reserved        =   "%" / "/" / "?" / "#"

      The exclusion of the colon from the list of "other" characters
      means that the colon can only occur as a delimiter between string
      tokens.  Note that this ABNF rule set guarantees that any valid
      Liberty NSS is also a valid RFC 2141 NSS.

      For example:

         urn:liberty:schemas:authctx:2002:05
         urn:liberty:schemas:core:2002:12

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      Identifiers are assigned by the Liberty Project within its various
      standards.  In the process of publishing a specification all newly
      minted names are checked against the record of previously assigned
      names.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      The assignment process guarantees that names are not reassigned
      and that the binding between the name and its resource is
      permanent, regardless of any standards or organizational changes.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Names are assigned by the Liberty standards publication process.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      At this time no resolution mechanism is specified.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      Lexical equivalence of two Liberty namespace specific strings
      (NSSs) is defined as an exact, case-sensitive string match.  The
      Liberty Alliance will assign names of immediately subordinate

      naming authorities in a case-insensitive fashion, so that there
      will not be two Liberty-subordinate naming authorities whose names
      differ only in case.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      There are no additional characters reserved.

   Validation mechanism:

      None other than verifying with the correct Liberty specifications.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a URN Namespace registration that has been
   entered into the IANA registry for URN NIDs.

4.  Community Considerations

   While there is no resolution mechanism for this namespace, the names
   themselves are used in public implementations of the Liberty
   specifications.  There are circumstances where objects from the
   Liberty system will become exposed to the general Internet.  In these
   cases, the use of the Liberty namespace will provide general
   interoperability benefits to the Internet at large.  Additionally,
   there may be subcomponents of the Liberty specifications that may be
   adopted by other standards, in which case the URNs used to identify
   those components and specifications can be easily used to enhance
   other, non-Liberty based, systems.

5.  Security Considerations

   Since there is no defined resolution mechanism for Liberty URNs it is
   difficult to authenticate the fact that a given namespace actually
   adheres to the standard, thus applications should be careful to not
   take some unverified sources assertion that what it is sending
   adheres to what the actual URN is assigned to.
