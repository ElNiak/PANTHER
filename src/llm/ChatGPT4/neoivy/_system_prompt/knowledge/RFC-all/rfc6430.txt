1.  Introduction

   In RFC 5965 [RFC5965], an Abuse Reporting Format (ARF) is defined for
   reporting email abuse.  Currently, two feedback report types are
   defined that are related to the spam problem and that can be used to
   report abusive or fraudulent email messages:

   o  abuse: indicates unsolicited email or some other kind of email
      abuse.

   o  fraud: indicates some kind of fraud or phishing activity.

   This specification defines a new feedback report type: "not-spam".
   It can be used to report a message that was mistakenly marked as
   spam.

1.1.  Discussion

   In some cases, the email client receives an email message that was
   incorrectly tagged as spam, perhaps by the email system, or
   accidentally by the user.  The email client accepts the end user's
   "not-spam" report instruction, retrieves information related to the
   message, and reports this email as not-spam to the email operator.
   When the email operator receives the report, it can determine what
   action is appropriate for the particular message and user.  (The
   requirement for a not-spam report type is from the Open Mobile
   Alliance (OMA) Spam Report Requirement Document [OMA-SpamRep-RD].)

   For example, in response to a "not-spam" report, the email system can
   remove the spam tag or otherwise reclassify the message, possibly
   preventing similar email for this user from being marked as spam in
   the future.  The report can be used to adjust the training of an
   automated classifier.  After processing the report, the email

RFC 6430              Email Feedback Type: not-spam        November 2011


   operator might send a notification to the email client about the
   processing result (for example, by moving the message from one
   mailbox to another, such as from "Junk" to "Inbox").

   In most cases, "not-spam" reports will probably not be taken on their
   own, but will be considered along with other information, analysis of
   the message, etc.  Because different users have different needs and
   different views of what constitutes spam, reports from one user might
   or might not be applicable to others.  And because users might
   sometimes press a "report not spam" button accidentally, immediate
   strong action, such as marking all similar messages as "good" based
   on a single report, is probably not the right approach.  Recipients
   of "not-spam" reports need to consider what's right in their
   environments.

   There are anti-spam systems that use (non-standard) "not spam"
   feedback today.  All of them take the reports and mix them with other
   spam reports and other data, using their own algorithms, to determine
   appropriate action.  In no case do the existing systems use a "not
   spam" report as an immediate, automatic override.

   The feedback types "abuse" and "not-spam" can be taken as opposites.
   A mistaken "not-spam" report could be countermanded by a subsequent
   "abuse" report from the same user, and an operator could consider
   collected reports of "abuse" and "not-spam" in making future
   assessments.

2.  Feedback Report Type: not-spam

   This document defines a new feedback report type, "not-spam", which
   extends the Email Feedback Reports specification [RFC5965].

   In the first MIME part of the feedback report message, the end user
   or the email client can add information to indicate why the message
   is not considered as spam -- for example, because the originator or
   its domain is well known.

3.  Example

   In the example, Joe, a pharmaceuticals sales representative, has
   received a message about discount pharmaceuticals.  Because that is a
   frequent subject of spam email, the message has been marked as spam
   -- incorrectly, in this case.  Joe has reported it as "not-spam", and
   this is an example of the report, shortened (the "[...etc...]" part)
   for presentation here.

   Note that the message has been signed using DomainKeys Identified
   Mail (DKIM) [RFC6376] -- a good security practice as suggested in
   Section 8.2 of RFC 5965 [RFC5965].

      Hi, Joe.  I got a lead on a source for discounts on
      pharmaceuticals, and I thought you might be interested.

4.  Security Considerations

   All of the security considerations from the Email Feedback Reports
   specification [RFC5965] are inherited here.  In addition, the Email
   Feedback Reports Applicability Statement [MARF-AS] contains important
   information about trust relationships and other security- and
   integrity-related aspects of accepting abuse feedback.

   In particular, not-spam reports will likely be used in an attack on a
   filtering system, reporting true spam as "not-spam".  Even in absence
   of malice, some not-spam reports might be made in error, or will only
   apply to the user sending the report.  Operators need to be careful
   in trusting such reports, beyond their applicability to the specific
   user in question.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the newly defined feedback type name: "not-spam",
   according to the instructions in Section 7.3 of the base
   specification [RFC5965].

   The following has been added to the "Feedback Report Type Values"
   registry:

   Feedback Type Name:  not-spam

   Description:  Indicates that the entity providing the report does not
      consider the message to be spam.  This may be used to correct a
      message that was incorrectly tagged or categorized as spam.
