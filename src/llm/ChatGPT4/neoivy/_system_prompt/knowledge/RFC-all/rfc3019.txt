             IP Version 6 Management Information Base for
               The Multicast Listener Discovery Protocol

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in Internet Protocol
   Version 6 internets.  Specifically, this document is the MIB module
   that defines managed objects for implementations of the Multicast
   Listener Discovery Protocol [RFC2710].

Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16,

RFC 3019                      MIB for MLD                   January 2001


   RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215
   [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The first
   version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and described
   in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the SNMP message
   protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
   called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and RFC 1906
   [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is called
   SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and
   RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The first
   set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
   STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol operations and
   associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] and
   the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
   [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of
   machine-readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

2. Overview

   This MIB module contains two tables:

      1. The MLD Interface Table, which contains one row for each
         interface on which MLD is enabled.

RFC 3019                      MIB for MLD                   January 2001


      2. The MLD Cache Table which contains one row for each IPv6
         Multicast group for which there are members on a particular
         interface.

   Both tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers. Some
   objects in each table apply to routers only.

Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to multicast sessions.  Some of these objects could contain
   sensitive information.  In particular, the mldCacheSelf and
   mldCacheLastReporter could be used to identify machines which are
   listening to a given group address.  There are also a number of
   objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create, which allow an administrator to configure MLD in the router.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause
   a denial of service.  Hence, the support of SET operations in a non-
   secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the network is allowed to access and
   SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-
   based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to access them.
