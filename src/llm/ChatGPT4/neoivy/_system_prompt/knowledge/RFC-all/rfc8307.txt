               Well-Known URIs for the WebSocket Protocol

Abstract

   RFC 5785 defines a path prefix, "/.well-known/", that can be used by
   well-known URIs.  It was specifically defined for the "http" and
   "https" URI schemes.  The present memo formally updates RFC 6455,
   which defines the URI schemes defined for the WebSocket Protocol, to
   extend the use of these well-known URIs to those URI schemes.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5785] defines a path prefix, "/.well-known", that can be used by
   well-known URIs.  It also contains an IANA registry for URI suffixes
   to be used with this path prefix for forming well-known URIs.

   In [RFC5785], this mechanism is specifically defined for the "http"
   and "https" URI schemes (now defined in [RFC7230]).  Other URI
   schemes such as "coap" and "coaps" [RFC7252] have since picked up
   this mechanism, sharing the registry of URI suffixes with that for
   HTTP(S).

   [RFC6455], which defines the URI schemes defined for the WebSocket
   Protocol, "ws" and "wss", does not define the use of well-known URIs
   for these URI schemes.

   The present memo formally updates [RFC6455] to extend the use of
   [RFC5785] well-known URIs to the URI schemes "ws" and "wss".

   Well-known URIs for "ws" and "wss" share the registry for URI
   suffixes established by [RFC5785]; no change is necessitated by the
   present memo in the registry or its IANA considerations.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

3.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC5785] apply and need to be
   considered for all well-known URIs.

   It has always been possible to form "ws" and "wss" URIs in such a way
   that they map to well-known HTTP(S) URIs when using the procedure in
   Section 4 of [RFC6455]; no new security considerations are created by
   now formally making the well-known URI mechanism available for "ws"
   and "wss".

RFC 8307       Well-Known URIs for the WebSocket Protocol   January 2018


   However, with well-known URIs becoming available for the WebSocket
   Protocol, applications that want to define well-known URI suffixes
   specifically for WebSocket use also need to consider whether the
   resources becoming available under the equivalent HTTP(S) URI formed
   by Section 4 of [RFC6455] pose any information disclosure or other
   security considerations.
