1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This document describes a management information base for the
   Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) Routing protocol,
   as described in ISO 10589 [ISO10589], when it is used to construct
   routing tables for IP networks, as described in RFC 1195 [RFC1195].
   The objects are mainly derived from the Guidelines for Definition of
   Managed Objects (GDMO) definitions in ISO 10589 and from the GDMO
   definitions in ISO 10733 [ISO10733].  There are also additional
   objects for managing the IP-specific functionality of Integrated IS-
   IS operation.

   This MIB imports definitions from SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411],
   DIFFSERV-MIB [RFC3289], IF-MIB [RFC2863], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB
   [RFC4001].  See the imports section of the MIB for the specific items
   imported.

   This MIB defines some objects to manage Mesh Groups, described in
   [RFC2973], and a three-way handshake for point-to-point adjacencies,
   described in [RFC3373].

   The IS-IS MIB defines the following objects:

   System-Wide Attributes

      -  isisSystem

         This table contains information specific to a single instance
         of the IS-IS protocol running on a router.

   Attributes associated with an Adjacency

      -  isisISAdj

         This table contains information about adjacencies to routers
         maintained by the protocol.  Entries in this table cannot be

5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

      Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
      ----------        -----------------------

      isisMIB           { mib-2 138 }

6.  Acknowledgements

   This MIB is based on a March 1994 document by Chris Gunner, who
   should be held blameless for the errors introduced since then.  This
   version has been modified to include MIB-II syntax, to exclude
   portions of the protocol that are not relevant to IP, such as the
   ES-IS protocol, and to add management support for current practice.

7.  Security Considerations

   Management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.

7.1.  Discussion

   This MIB may be used to manage an IP router, which is used to direct
   network traffic.  The control of network traffic allows an attacker
   to deny service to a region of the network or to forward traffic to
   adversaries.  By raising or lowering metrics, traffic may be directed
   to insecure portions of the network.  By disabling the protocol on an
   interface, the network may be partitioned.  Changes to the network
   topology will force all routers to recompute their routes.  Periodic
   route changes have brought down networks in the past by subjecting
   routers to stressful recomputations.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network

   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  Authentication of received SNMP requests and
   controlled access to management information should be employed in
   such environments.

   We identify a set of threats and then list attributes that can be
   used in each form of attack.  We discuss the effects that can be
   obtained by a single change to the variable in each class.

7.2.  Threats

      - Drop an Adjacency
      - Drop all Peers
      - Drop Subnetwork
      - Split the Network
      - Intermittent Outages
      - Redirect Traffic
      - Delay Convergence
      - Avoid Detection
      - Prevent Updates
      - Hijack LAN
      - Create Problems for CLNS Networks

7.2.1.  Drop an Adjacency

   By changing attributes that are used to peer, we can disrupt an
   adjacency and bring a link down.

      isisCirc3WayEnabled
      isisCircAdminState
      isisCircExistState
      isisCircLevelDRHelloTimer
      isisCircLevelHelloTimer
      isisCircLevelType
      isisCircSmallHellos

7.2.2.  Drop All Adjacencies

   These attributes can be used to break some or all of a router's
   adjacencies.  In the case of System ID, the adjacency may be
   restored.  However, it will subject the network to additional stress.

      isisSysLevelType
      isisManAreaAddrExistState
      isisSysAdminState
      isisSysID

7.2.3.  Drop Subnetwork

   This attribute can be used to stop advertisement of a subnetwork
   reachable through a single interface.

      isisCircPassiveCircuit

7.2.4.  Split the Network

   If the network design depends upon Wide Metrics or TE, we can use
   these attributes to prevent traffic from passing through a router.

      isisSysLevelMetricStyle
      isisSysLevelOrigLSPBuffSize
      isisSysLevelSPFConsiders
      isisSysLevelTEEnabled
      isisSysReceiveLSPBufferSize

7.2.5.  Intermittent Outages

   We can use these attributes to subject the network to a series of
   topology changes, or otherwise force extensive recomputations of
   routes.

      isisSysLevelMinLSPGenInt
      isisSysLevelSetOverload
      isisSysLevelSetOverloadUntil
      isisSysMaxAge
      isisSysMaxLSPGenInt
      isisSysL2toL1Leaking
      isisSysID

7.2.6.  Redirect Traffic

   By changing attributes such as metrics, we can push traffic to
   different parts of the network.  This may allow an intruder to
   observe data traffic from otherwise remote parts of the network.

   We may also use these attributes to deny service to parts of the
   network.

      isisSysMaxPathSplits
      isisCircLevelMetric
      isisCircLevelWideMetric
      isisIPRAAdminState
      isisIPRAExistState
      isisIPRAFullMetric
      isisIPRAMetric

      isisIPRAMetricType
      isisIPRANextHop
      isisIPRANextHopType
      isisIPRASNPAAddress
      isisIPRAType
      isisRedistributeAddrExistState
      isisSummAddrExistState
      isisSummAddrFullMetric
      isisSummAddrMetric
      isisSysL2toL1Leaking

7.2.7.  Delay Convergence

   These attributes can be used to slow convergence by increasing the
   minimal interval required to update a packet.

      isisCircLevelCSNPInterval
      isisCircLevelLSPThrottle
      isisCircLevelMinLSPRetransInt
      isisCircLevelPartSNPInterval
      isisSysWaitTime
      isisCircPassiveCircuit

7.2.8.  Avoid Detection

   By turning off traps, we can prevent a Network Management station
   from observing problems in the network caused by other aspects of an
   attack.

      isisSysNotificationEnable

7.2.9.  Prevent Updates

   Mesh Groups can be used to prevent the transmission of Link State
   PDUs on certain interfaces, delaying or preventing the propagation of
   updates.

      isisCircMeshGroup
      isisCircMeshGroupEnabled

7.2.10. Hijack LAN

   If we have compromised a router, we can use this attribute to become
   the designated router and lie about the topology of a LAN.

      isisCircLevelISPriority

7.2.11.  Create Problems for CLNS Networks

   This attribute can be used to modify the handling of CLNS traffic.

      isisRAAddrPrefix
      isisRAAdminState
      isisRAExistState
      isisRAMapType
      isisRAMetric
      isisRAMetricType
      isisRASNPAAddress
      isisRASNPAMask
      isisRASNPAPrefix
      isisRAType
      isisSysPollESHelloRate

7.2.12.  Mostly Harmless

   The following writable attributes do not pose a known security risk.

      isisCircExtDomain
      isisCircExtendedCircID
      isisCircIfIndex
      isisCircLevelHelloMultiplier
      isisCircType

7.2.13.  Recommendations

   Much of the MIB is used to set or read attributes which are readily
   visible to any intruder who has access to traffic.  None of the
   security attributes are setable or visible through the MIB.  Read
   access to the MIB does not pose additional risks or vulnerabilities.

   If write access is to be provided, it is RECOMMENDED that
   implementers consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3
   framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the
   SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   Deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
   Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
   cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
