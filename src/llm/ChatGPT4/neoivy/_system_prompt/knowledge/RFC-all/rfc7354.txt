1.  Introduction

   [RFC5328] registered the Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace "dvb"
   for the Digital Video Broadcasting Project.  Since the publication of
   that RFC, the registrant contact information has changed; this
   document updates the registrant information to make it current.  It
   uses a role-based email address to reduce the need for updates in the
   future.

2.  Registration Update

   This replaces the "Registration Information" and "Declared registrant
   of the namespace" fields in the registration, specified in Section 2
   of RFC 5328.  The new information for those fields is as follows:

   Registration Information:

         Version: 2
         Date: 2014-08-11

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

         Name:         Peter Siebert
         Title:        Executive Director, DVB Project Office
         Affiliation:  DVB Digital Video Broadcasting
         Address:      Ancienne Route 17a
                       CH-1218 Geneva
                       SWITZERLAND
         Phone:        +41 22 717 2717
         Email:        dvb@dvb.org

   All other fields in the registration information are unchanged and
   remain as specified in RFC 5328.

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations for this registration update.

4.  IANA Considerations

   In the "Formal URN Namespaces" registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces), IANA has added a
   reference to this RFC, in addition to RFC 5328, for the "dvb"
   namespace registration.  The reference field now contains two RFC
   numbers.
