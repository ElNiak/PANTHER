1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   Specifically, this memo extends the basic Network Services Monitoring
   MIB [8] to allow monitoring of Message Transfer Agents (MTAs). It may
   also be used to monitor MTA components within gateways.

3.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of seven major
   components. They are:

   o    RFC 1902 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    RFC 1903 [2] defines textual conventions for SNMPv2.

   o    RFC 1904 [3] defines conformance statements for SNMPv2.

   o    RFC 1905 [4] defines  transport mappings for SNMPv2.

   o    RFC 1906 [5] defines the protocol operations used for network
        access to managed objects.

   o    RFC 1907 [6] defines the Management Information Base for SNMPv2.

   o    RFC 1908 [7] specifies coexistance between SNMP and SNMPv2.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

3.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name. The object type
   together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

4.  Message Flow Model

   A general model of message flow inside an MTA has to be presented
   before a MIB can be described. Generally speaking, message flow is
   modelled as occuring in four steps:

    (1)   Messages are received by the MTA from User Agents, Message
          Stores, other MTAs, and gateways.

    (2)   The "next hop" for the each message is determined. This is
          simply the destination the message is to be transmitted to; it
          may or may not be the final destination of the message.



Freed & Kille               Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 2249                  Mail Monitoring MIB               January 1998


          Multiple "next hops" may exist for a single message (as a
          result of either having multiple recipients or distribution
          list expansion); this may make it necessary to duplicate
          messages.

    (3)   If necessary messages are converted into the format that's
          appropriate for the next hop. Conversion operations may be
          successful or unsuccessful.

    (4)   Messages are transmitted to the appropriate destination, which
          may be a User Agent, Message Store, another MTA, or gateway.

   Storage of messages in the MTA occurs at some point during this
   process.  However, it is important to note that storage may occur at
   different and possibly even multiple points during this process. For
   example, some MTAs expand messages into multiple copies as they are
   received. In this case (1), (2), and (3) may all occur prior to
   storage. Other MTAs store messages precisely as they are received and
   perform all expansions and conversions during retransmission
   processing. So here only (1) occurs prior to storage.  This leads to
   situations where, in general, a measurement of messages received may
   not equal a measurement of messages in store, or a measurement of
   messages stored may not equal a measurement of messages
   retransmitted, or both.

5.  MTA Objects

   If there are one or more MTAs on the host, the following MIB may be
   used to monitor them. Any number of the MTAs on a single host or
   group of hosts may be monitored. Each MTA is dealt with as a separate
   network service and has its own applTable entry in the Network
   Services Monitoring MIB.

   The MIB described in this document covers only the portion which is
   specific to the monitoring of MTAs. The network service related part
   of the MIB is covered in a separate document [8].

   This MIB defines four tables. The first of these contains per-MTA
   information that isn't specific to any particular part of MTA. The
   second breaks each MTA down into a collection of separate components
   called groups. Groups are described in detail in the comments
   embedded in the MIB below. The third table provides a means of
   correlating associations tracked by the network services MIB with
   specific groups within different MTAs. Finally, the fourth table
   provides a means of tracking any errors encountered during the
   operation of the MTA. The first two tables must be implemented to
   conform with this MIB; the last two are optional.

       counts the number of times the MTA has detected such a
       situation since MTA initialization. Note that the
       mechanism MTAs use to detect loops (e.g. trace field
       counting, count of references to this MTA in a trace
       field, examination of DNS or other directory information,
       etc.), the level at which loops are detected (e.g. per
       message, per recipient, per directory entry, etc.), and
       the handling of a loop once it is detected (e.g. looping
       messages are held, looping messages are bounced or sent
       to the postmaster, messages that the MTA knows will loop
       won't be accepted, etc.) vary widely from one MTA to the
       next and cannot be inferred from this variable."
    ::= {mtaEntry 12}

-- MTAs typically group inbound reception, queue storage, and
-- outbound transmission in some way, rather than accounting for
-- such operations only across the MTA as a whole. In the most
-- extreme case separate information will be maintained for each
-- different entity that receives messages and for each entity
-- the MTA stores messages for and delivers messages to.  Other
-- MTAs may elect to treat all reception equally, all queue
-- storage equally, all deliveries equally, or some combination
-- of this. Overlapped groupings are also possible, where an MTA
-- decomposes its traffic in different ways for different
-- purposes.

-- In any case, a grouping abstraction is an extremely useful for
-- breaking down the activities of an MTA. For purposes of
-- labelling this will be called a "group" in this MIB.

-- Each group contains all the variables needed to monitor all
-- aspects of an MTA's operation.  However, the fact that all
-- groups contain all possible variables does not imply that all
-- groups must use all possible variables. For example, a single
-- group might be used to monitor only one kind of event (inbound
-- processing, outbound processing, or storage). In this sort of
-- configuration all unused counters would be inaccessible; e.g.,
-- returning either a noSuchName error (for an SNMPv1 get), or a
-- noSuchInstance exception (for an SNMPv2 get).

-- Groups can be created at any time after MTA initialization. Once
-- a group is created it should not be deleted or its mtaGroupIndex
-- changed unless the MTA is reinitialized.

-- Groups are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A given event may
-- be recorded by more than one group, a message may be seen as
-- stored by more than one group, and so on.  Groups should be all
-- inclusive, however: if groups are implemented all aspects of an
-- MTA's operation should be registered in at least one group. This
-- freedom lets implementors use different sets of groups to
-- provide differents "views" of an MTA.

-- The possibility of overlap between groups means that summing
-- variables across groups may not produce values equal to those in
-- the mtaTable. mtaTable should always provide accurate information
-- about the MTA as a whole.

-- The term "channel" is often used in MTA implementations; channels
-- are usually, but not always, equivalent to a group. However,
-- this MIB does not use the term "channel" because there is no
-- requirement that an MTA supporting this MIB has to map its
-- "channel" abstraction one-to-one onto the MIB's group abstration.

-- An MTA may create a group or group of groups at any time. Once
-- created, however, an MTA cannot delete an entry for a group from
-- the group table.  Deletation is only allowed when the MTA is
-- reinitialized, and is not required even then.  This restriction
-- is imposed so that monitoring agents can rely on group
-- assignments being consistent across multiple query operations.

-- Groups may be laid out so as to form a hierarchical arrangement,
-- with some groups acting as subgroups for other groups.
-- Alternately, disjoint groups of groups may be used to provide
-- different sorts of "snapshots" of MTA operation.  The
-- mtaGroupHierarchy variable provides an indication of how each
-- group fits into the overall arrangement being used.

7.  Changes made since RFC 1566

   The only changes made to this document since it was issued as RFC
   1566 [11] are the following:

    (1)   A number of DESCRIPTION fields have been reworded, hopefully
          making them clearer.

    (2)   mtaGroupDescription and mtaGroupURL fields have been added.
          These fields are intended to identify and describe the MTA and
          the various MTA groups.

    (3)   The time since the last outbound association attempt is now
          distinct from the time since the last successfuol outbound
          association attempt.

    (4)   Conversion operation counters have been added.

    (5)   A mechanism to explicitly describe group hierarchies has been
          added.

    (6)   A mechanism to count specific sorts of errors has been added.

    (7)   A field for the ID of the oldest message in a group's queue
          has been added.

    (8)   Per-MTA and per-group message loop counters have been added.

    (9)   A new table has been added to keep track of any errors an MTA
          encounters.

8.  Acknowledgements

   This document is a work product of the Mail and Directory Management
   (MADMAN) Working Group of the IETF. It is based on an earlier MIB
   designed by S. Kille, T. Lenggenhager, D. Partain, and W. Yeong. The
   Electronic Mail Association's TSC committee was instrumental in
   providing feedback on and suggesting enhancements to RFC 1566 [11]
   that have led to the present document.

10.  Security Considerations

   This MIB does not offer write access, and as such cannot be used to
   actively attack a system. However, this MIB does provide passive
   information about the existance, type, and configuration of
   applications on a given host that could potentially indicate some
   sort of vulnerability. Finally, the information MIB provides about
   network usage could be used to analyze network traffic patterns.
