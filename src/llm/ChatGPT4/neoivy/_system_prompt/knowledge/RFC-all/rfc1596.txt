1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o    RFC 1442 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of
           management.

      o    STD 17, RFC 1213 defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o    RFC 1445 which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      o    RFC 1448 which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to manage
   is Frame Relay Service.  At present, this applies to these values of
   the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

          frameRelayService (44)

   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
   MIB and other potential MIBs when managing a Frame Relay Service.

   Figure 1 shows the MIB stack that could be followed for managing a
   Frame Relay Service.  This is only an example and not meant to be
   inclusive.

                     Figure 1. Frame Relay MIB Architecture

3.1.  Scope of MIB

   The Frame Relay Service MIB will only manage the Frame Relay portion
   of the network.  This MIB is based upon the Customer Network
   Management concepts presented in the document "Service Management
   Architecture for Virtual Connection Services" [6].

   This MIB will NOT be implemented on User Equipment (e.g., DTE), and
   the Frame Relay DTE MIB (RFC 1315) should be used to manage those
   devices [8].

   Frame Relay Service MIB is intended to be used for Customer Network
   Management (CNM) of a Frame Relay Network Service.  It provides
   information that allows end-customers to obtain performance
   monitoring, fault detection, and configuration information about
   their Frame Relay Service.  It is an implementation decision as to
   whether this MIB is used to create/delete/modify PVCs and to turn
   PVCs on or off.

   By using this and other related MIBs, a customer's NMS can monitor
   their PVCs and UNI/NNI logical ports.  Internal aspects of the
   network (e.g., switching elements, line cards, and network routing
   tables) are outside the scope of this MIB.  The Customer's NMS will
   typically access the SNMP proxy-agent within the Frame Relay network
   using SNMP over UDP over IP with IP encapsulated in Frame Relay
   according to RFC1490/ANSI T1.617 Annex F [7,9].  The customer, thus,

RFC 1596                Frame Relay Service MIB               March 1994


   has a PVC to the SNMP proxy-agent.  Alternate access mechanisms and
   SNMP agent implementations are possible.  The service capabilities
   include retrieving information and receiving TRAPs.  It is beyond the
   scope of this MIB to define managed objects to monitor the physical
   layer.  Existing physical layer MIBs (e.g., DS1 MIB) and MIB II will
   be used as possible.  The Frame Relay Service SNMP MIB for CNM will
   not contain any managed objects to monitor the physical layer.  This
   MIB primarily addresses Frame Relay PVCs.  This MIB may be extended
   at a later time to handle Frame Relay SVCs.

   This MIB is only used to manage a single Frame Relay Service offering
   from one network.  This MIB will typically be implemented on a
   service provider's SNMP proxy-agent. The SNMP proxy-agent proxies for
   all Frame Relay equipment within one service provider's Frame Relay
   network.  (Other SNMP agent implementations are not precluded.)
   Therefore, this MIB models a PVC segment through one Frame Relay
   Network.  See Figure 2.  If the customer's PVCs traverse multiple
   networks, then the customer needs to poll multiple network proxy-
   agents within each Frame Relay Network to retrieve their end-to-end
   view of their service.  See Figure 2 and the Service Management
   Architecture [6].

   Also, since the Frame Relay network is a shared network amongst many
   Frame Relay subscribers, each subscriber will only have access to
   their information (e.g., information with respect to their interfaces
   and PVCs).  Therefore, in order to provide this capability, the Frame
   Relay PVC CNM proxy agent should be able to support instance level
   granularity for MIB views.  See the Service Management Architecture.

3.2.  Frame Relay Service MIB Terminology

   Access Channel - An access channel generically refers to the DS1/E1
   or DS3/E3-based UNI access channel or NNI access channel across which
   frame relay data transits. An access channel is the access pathway
   for a single stream of user data.

   Within a given T1 line, an access channel can denote any one of the
   following:




Frame Relay Service MIB Working Group                           [Page 5]

RFC 1596                Frame Relay Service MIB               March 1994


      o    Unchannelized T1 - the entire T1 line is considered an access
           channel. Each access channel is comprised of 24 T1 time
           slots.

      o    Channelized T1 - an access channel is any one of 24 channels.
           Each access channel is comprised of a single T1 time slot.

      o    Fractional T1 - an access channel is a grouping of N T1 time
           slots (NX56/64 Kbps, where N = 1-23 T1 Time slots per FT1
           Access Channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or
           non-consecutive order.

   Within a given E1 line, a channel can denote any one of the
   following:

      o    Unchannelized E1 - the entire E1 line is considered a single
           access channel.  Each access channel is comprised of 31 E1
           time slots.

      o    Channelized E1 - an access channel is any one of 31 channels.
           Each access channel is comprised of a single E1 time slot.

      o    Fractional E1 - an access channel is a grouping of N E1 time
           slots (NX64 Kbps, where N = 1-30 E1 time slots per FE1 access
           channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or
           non-consecutive order.

      in 3 Within a given unformatted line, the entire unformatted line
      is considered an access channel. Examples include RS-232, V.35,
      V.36 and X.21 (non- switched).

      Access Rate - The data rate of the access channel, expressed in
      bits/second.  The speed of the user access channel determines how
      rapidly the end user can inject data into the network.

      Bc - The Committed Burst Size (Bc) is the maximum amount of
      subscriber data (expressed in bits) that the network agrees to
      transfer, under normal conditions, during a time interval Tc.

      Be - The Excess Burst Size (Be) is the maximum amount of
      subscriber data (expressed in bits) in excess of Bc that the
      network will attempt to deliver during the time interval Tc.  This
      data (Be) is delivered in general with a lower probability than
      Bc.

      CIR - The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber data
      rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to
      deliver under normal network conditions.  CIR is averaged over the

RFC 1596                Frame Relay Service MIB               March 1994


      time interval Tc (CIR = Bc/Tc).

      DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier

      Logical Port - This term is used to model the Frame Relay
      "interface" on a device.

      NNI - Network to Network Interface

      Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that has
      its end-points and bearer capabilities defined at subscription
      time.

      Time slot (E1) - An octet within the 256-bit information field in
      each E1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are position
      sensitive within the 256-bit information field.  Fractional E1
      service is provided in contiguous or non- contiguous time slot
      increments.

      Time slot (T1) - An octet within the 192-bit information field in
      each T1 frame is defined as a time slot. Time slots are position
      sensitive within the 192-bit information field.  Fractional T1
      service is provided in contiguous or non- contiguous time slot
      increments.

      UNI - User to Network Interface

      N391 - Full status (status of all PVCs) polling counter

      N392 - Error threshold

      N393 - Monitored events count

      T391 - Link integrity verification polling timer

      T392 - Polling verification timer

      nT3 - Status enquiry timer

      nN3 - Maximum status enquiry counter

3.3.  Apply MIB II to a Frame Relay Service

      Use the System Group to apply to the SNMP proxy-agent, since the
      proxy-agent may be monitoring many Frame Relay devices in one
      network.  System Group applies to only one system.  This group is
      not instantiated.

          sysDescr:  ASCII string describing the SNMP proxy-agent.
                     Can be up to 255 characters long. This field is
                     generally used to indicate the network providers
                     identification and type of service offered.

          sysObjectID:  Unique OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID) for the SNMP
                        proxy-agent.

          sysUpTime:  Clock in the SNMP proxy-agent; TimeTicks
                      in 1/100s of a second.  Elapsed type since
                      the proxy-agent came on line.

          sysContact:  Contact for the SNMP proxy-agent.
                       ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

          sysName:  Domain name of the SNMP proxy-agent, for example,
                    acme.com

          sysLocation:  Location of the SNMP proxy-agent.
                        ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

          sysServices:  Services of the managed device.  The value "2",
                        which implies that
                        the Frame Relay network is providing
                        a subnetwork level service, is recommended.

   This specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in MIB II shall be
   used for the management of Frame Relay based interfaces, and in
   conjunction with the Frame Relay Service MIB module. This memo
   assumes the interpretation of the evolution of the Interfaces group
   to be in accordance with: "The interfaces table (ifTable) contains
   information on the managed resource's interfaces.  Each sub-layer
   below the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an
   interface." Thus, the ifTable allows the following Frame Relay-based
   interfaces to be represented as table entries:

          - Frame Relay interfaces in the Frame Relay equipment (e.g.,
            switches, routers or networks) with Frame Relay interfaces.
            This level is concerned with generic frame counts and
            not with individual virtual connections.

   In accordance with the guidelines of ifTable, frame counts per
   virtual connection are not covered by ifTable, and are considered
   interface specific and covered in the Frame Relay Service MIB module.
   In order to interrelate the ifEntries properly, the Interfaces Stack
   Group shall be supported.

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for Frame Relay follow.

                            (this is not the clocking speed).  For
                            example, it is 1,536,000 bits per
                            second for a DS1-based UNI/NNI logical
                            port and 1,984,000 bits per second for an

                             this object contains a zero value.

           ifInOctets        The number of received octets.
                             This counter only counts octets from the
                             beginning of the frame relay header field

                             unicast frames.

           ifInDiscards      The number of received frames discarded.
                             Possible reasons are as follows:
                             policing, congestion.

           ifInErrors        The number of received frames that are
                             discarded, because of an error.
                             Possible errors can be the following: the
                             frame relay frames were too long or were
                             too short, the frames had an invalid or
                             unrecognized DLCI values, or incorrect
                             header values.

           ifInUnknownProtos  The number of packets discarded because
                              of an unknown or unsupported protocol.
                              For Frame Relay Service interfaces, this
                              counter will always be zero.

           ifOutOctets       The number of transmitted octets.

                             beginning of the frame relay header field
                             to the end of user data.

           ifOutUcastpkts    The number of frames sent.

           ifOutDiscards     The number of frames discarded in the
                             egress direction. Possible
                             reasons are as follows:  policing,
                             congestion.

           ifOutErrors       The number of frames discarded in the
                             egress direction, because of errors.
                             Possible reason is transmit underruns.

   Frame Relay Network Service interfaces support the Interface Stack
   Group.  Frame Relay Network Service interfaces do not support any
   other groups or objects in the Interfaces group of MIB II.  Also,
   supporting the SNMP Group of MIB II is an implementation choice.

 -- The PVC End-Point Group

 -- This table is used to identify the traffic parameters
 -- for a bi-directional PVC segment end-point, and it also
 -- provides statistics for a PVC segment
 -- end-point.

 -- A PVC segment end-point is identified by a UNI/NNI
 -- logical port index value and DLCI index value.

 -- If the Frame Relay service provider allows
 -- the Frame Relay CNM subscriber to create, modify
 -- or delete PVCs using SNMP, then this table is used to identify
 -- and reserve
 -- the requested traffic parameters of each
 -- PVC segment end-point.  The Connection table
 -- is used to "connect" the end-points together.
 -- Not all implementations will support the
 -- capability of creating/modifying/deleting
 -- PVCs using SNMP as a feature of Frame Relay
 -- CNM service.

 -- Uni-directional PVCs are modeled with zero
 -- valued traffic parameters in one of the
 -- directions (In or Out direction) in this table.

 -- To create a PVC, the following procedures
 -- shall be followed:
 -- 1). Create the entries for the PVC segment endpoints in the
 --     frPVCEndptTable by specifying the traffic parameters
 --     for the bi-directional PVC segment endpoints.
 --     As shown in the figure, a point-to-point PVC has
 --     two endpoints, thus two entries in this table.
 --     Uni-directional PVCs are modeled
 --     with zero valued traffic parameters in one
 --     direction; all the `In' direction parameters
 --     for one Frame Relay PVC End-point or
 --     all the `Out' direction
 --     parameters for the other Frame Relay PVC
 --     End-point.

 -- The Frame Relay PVC Connection Group

 -- The Frame Relay PVC Connection Group
 -- is used to model the bi-directional
 -- PVC segment flows;
 -- point-to-point PVCs, point-to-multipoint
 -- PVCs, and multipoint-to-multipoint
 -- PVCs.

 -- This table has read-create access and
 -- is used to associate PVC end-points
 -- together as belonging to one connection.
 -- The frPVCConnectIndex is used to associate
 -- all the bi-directional flows.
 -- Not all implementations will support the
 -- capability of creating/modifying/deleting
 -- PVCs using SNMP as a feature of Frame Relay
 -- CNM service.

 -- Once the entries in the frPVCEndptTable
 -- are created, the following step are used
 -- to associate the PVC end-points as belonging
 -- to one PVC connection:
 -- 1). Obtain a unique frPVCConnectIndex
 --     using the frPVCConnectIndexValue object.
 -- 2). Connect the PVC segment endpoints together
 --     with the applicable frPVCConnectIndex value
 --     obtained via
 --     frPVCConnectIndexValue.
 --     The entries in this table are created by using
 --     the frPVCConnectRowStatus object.
 -- 3). The agent will provide the value of the
 --     corresponding instances of
 --     frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier with the
 --     the frPVCConnectIndex value.
 -- 4). Set frPVCConnectAdminStatus to `active' in all
 --     rows for this PVC segment to
 --     turn the PVC on.

 -- For example, the Frame Relay PVC Connection Group
 -- models a bi-directional, point-to-point PVC segment
 -- as one entry in this table.

 -- Frame Relay Network                  Frame Relay Network
 --  Low Port ____________________________________ High Port
 --          |                                   |
 --    ______| >> from low to high PVC flow   >> |____________
 --          | << from high to low PVC flow   << |
 --          |___________________________________|
 --

 -- The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical
 -- ordering of a PVC segment's endpoints for representation
 -- in this table.  That is, the endpoint with the lower value
 -- of ifIndex is termed 'low', while the opposite endpoint
 -- of the segment is termed 'high'.
 -- This terminology is to provide directional information;
 -- for example the frPVCConnectL2hOperStatus and
 -- frPVCConnectH2lOperStatus as illustrated above.

 -- If the Frame Relay Connection table is used to model
 -- a unidirectional PVC, then one direction (either from low to high
 -- or from high to low) has its Operational Status equal to down.

 -- A PVC segment is a portion of a PVC
 -- that traverses one Frame Relay Network, and
 -- a PVC segment is identified
 -- by its two end-points (UNI/NNI logical port index
 -- value and DLCI index value)
 -- through one Frame Relay Network.
