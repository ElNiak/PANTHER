                        The AM (Armenia) Domain

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

The AM Domain

   The AM Domain is an official Internet top-level domain of Armenia.

   AM is the ISO-3166 2-letter country code for the Republic of Armenia
   and thus the AM Domain is established as a top-level domain and
   registered with the InterNIC the same way other country domains are.

Naming Structure

   The AM Domain hierarchy is flat. This means that any organization may
   be registered directly under the AM TLD. Example: arminco.am.

   However, subdomains are allowed, such as ORG and MIL, as well as CO
   and AC.

   Please note that MIL.AM and GOV.AM domains are reserved by the
   Ministry of Defense and The Government of Armenia, respectively.
   Other domains may be reserved for appropriate organizations by
   contacting AM Network Information Center at HOSTMASTER@AMNIC.NET.

Registration

   There are two types of registrations (1) Delegation, where a branch
   of the AM Domain is delegated to an organization running name servers
   to support that branch; or (2) Direct Registration, in which the
   information is put directly into the main database.

   In Direct Registration there are two cases: (a) an IP-host (with an
   IP address), and (b) non-IP host (for example, a UUCP host).  Any
   particular registration will involve any one of these three
   situations.

RFC 2053                The AM (Armenia) Domain             October 1996


   The registration is performed by the AM Network Information Center,
   national Internet registry of Armenia. For more information about AM
   Network Information Center, please visit:

Requirements

   Anyone requesting to register a host in the AM Domain is sent a copy
   of the "AM second-level domain registration template". It is
   necessary to fill out this template and send via Internet e-mail to
   HOSTMASTER@AMNIC.NET for consideration.

   The AM Domain template, is similar to the InterNIC Domain template,
   but it is not the same.  To request a copy of the AM Domain template,
   send a message to HOSTMASTER@AMNIC.NET.
