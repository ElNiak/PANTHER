RFC 6713              Media Types 'zlib' and 'gzip'          August 2012


1.  Introduction

   zlib [RFC1950] and gzip [RFC1952] are widely used compression
   formats. zlib is a stream format, while gzip adds header and trailer
   fields more appropriate for a file format.  Both implement the
   DEFLATE compression scheme described in [RFC1951].

   They are used to compress a wide variety of material, from
   unstructured text to structured data to executable code.

   Some applications have informally used media types such as
   application/gzip-compressed, application/gzipped, application/
   x-gunzip, application/x-gzip, application/x-gzip-compressed, and
   gzip/document to describe data compressed with gzip.  The media types
   defined in this document should replace those media types in future
   applications.

2.  The 'application/zlib' Media Type

   The 'application/zlib' media type describes a block of data that is
   compressed using zlib [RFC1950] compression.  The data is a stream of
   bytes as described in RFC 1950.

2.1.  Registration Details

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: zlib

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters: N/A

   Encoding considerations: Binary

   Security considerations: See Section 4 below.

   Interoperability considerations: N/A

   Published specification: [RFC1950]

   Applications that use this media type: anywhere data size is an issue

   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): first byte is usually 0x78 but can also be 0x08,
      0x18, 0x28, 0x38, 0x48, 0x58, or 0x68.  The first two bytes, when
      interpreted as an unsigned 16-bit number in big-endian byte order,
      contain a value that is a multiple of 31.

3.  The 'application/gzip' Media Type

   The 'application/gzip' media type describes a block of data that is
   compressed using gzip [RFC1952] compression.  The data is a stream of
   bytes as described in RFC 1952.

3.1.  Registration Details

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: gzip

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters: N/A

   Encoding considerations: Binary

   Security considerations: See Section 4 below.

   Interoperability considerations: N/A

   Published specification: [RFC1952]

   Applications that use this media type: anywhere data size is an issue

   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): first two bytes are 0x1f, 0x8b.
      File extension(s): gz
      Macintosh file type code(s): N/A

   Person and email address to contact for further information: see
   http://www.gzip.org/

4.  Security Considerations

   zlib and gzip compression can be used to compress arbitrary binary
   data such as hostile executable code.  Also, data that purports to be
   in zlib or gzip format may not be, and fields that are supposed to be
   flags, lengths, or pointers could contain anything.  Applications
   should treat any data with due skepticism.

   Also see the security considerations in the underlying format
   documents: Section 5 of [RFC1950], Section 6 of [RFC1951], and
   Section 4 of [RFC1952].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated the "Application Media Types" registry to include
   'application/zlib' as described in Section 2 and 'application/gzip'
   as described in Section 3.
