           Update to RFC 3777 to Clarify Nominating Committee
                     Eligibility of IETF Leadership

Abstract

   RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of the IAB and IESG "may
   not volunteer to serve on the nominating committee".  Since the time
   that document was written, the IETF Administrative Oversight
   Committee (IAOC) was formed; that body is not covered by RFC 3777.
   There is also ambiguity in RFC 3777 about whether ex officio members
   and liaisons are included as "sitting members".  This document
   updates RFC 3777 to clarify the rules as they apply to members of the
   IAB, the IESG, and the IAOC.

1.  Introduction

   The "IAB and IESG Selection, Confirmation, and Recall Process:
   Operation of the Nominating and Recall Committees" document [RFC3777]
   defines the nominating committee process.  On the nominating
   committee, it is important to include people who have the experience
   necessary to understand the IETF process: those individuals can bring
   a broader perspective to the nominating committee and will help
   ensure that the people it selects are better prepared to fulfill the
   roles.  That said, one of the key points in the process and in the
   selection of the nominating committee is that the IETF wants to avoid
   having the IAB and the IESG be self-selecting.  The selection of the
   nominating committee, therefore, excludes individuals who currently
   serve on the bodies to which the nominating committee selects seats.

   RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of the IAB and IESG "may
   not volunteer to serve on the nominating committee".  Since the time
   that document was written, the IETF Administrative Oversight
   Committee (IAOC) was formed.  Some IAOC members are selected by the
   nominating committee (see [RFC4071], Section 4), and that body is not
   covered by RFC 3777.  There is also ambiguity in RFC 3777 about
   whether ex officio members, liaisons, and such are included as
   "sitting members".  This document updates RFC 3777 to clarify the
   rules as they apply to members of the IAB, the IESG, and the IAOC,
   with the understanding of the intent of RFC 3777 as outlined above.

   RFC 3777 does not exclude participation by working group chairs, IRTF
   research group chairs, members of directorates and special review
   teams, or members of other advisory bodies.  This document makes no
   changes in that regard.

2.  Replacement of RFC 3777, Section 4, Rule 15

   The following paragraph replaces RFC 3777, Section 4, rule 15 in its
   entirety.

   15.  Any person who serves on any of the Internet Society Board of
   Trustees, the IAB, the IESG, or the IAOC, including those who serve
   on these bodies in ex officio positions, may not volunteer to serve
   as voting members of the nominating committee.  Liaisons to these
   bodies from other bodies or organizations are not excluded by this
   rule.

3.  Security Considerations

   This is a procedural document, and it is entirely unrelated to
   security.
