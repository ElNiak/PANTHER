1.  Introduction

   The WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] enables bidirectional message
   exchange between clients and servers on top of a persistent TCP
   connection (optionally secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246]).  The initial protocol handshake makes use of Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC7230] semantics, allowing the WebSocket
   protocol to reuse existing HTTP infrastructure.

   Modern web browsers include a WebSocket client stack compliant with
   the WebSocket API [WS-API] as specified by the W3C.  It is expected
   that other client applications (e.g., those running on personal
   computers, mobile devices, etc.) will also make a WebSocket client
   stack available.  Several specifications have been written that
   define how different applications can use a WebSocket subprotocol as
   a reliable transport mechanism.

RFC 8124                 WebSocket SDP Attribute              March 2017


   For example, [RFC7118] defines a WebSocket subprotocol as a reliable
   transport mechanism between Session Initiation Protocol
   (SIP)[RFC3261] entities to enable use of SIP in web-oriented
   deployments.  Additionally, [RFC7977] defines a new WebSocket
   subprotocol as a reliable transport mechanism between Message Session
   Relay Protocol (MSRP) clients and relays.  [RFC7395] defines a
   WebSocket subprotocol for the Extensible Messaging and Presence
   Protocol (XMPP).  Similarly, [BFCP-WEBSOCKET] defines a WebSocket
   subprotocol as a reliable transport mechanism between Binary Floor
   Control Protocol (BFCP) [BFCP] entities to enable usage of BFCP in
   new scenarios.

   When a WebSocket subprotocol is used as a transport mechanism between
   a server and client, there needs to be a way to indicate the
   connection URI from the server to the WebSocket client.  For
   applications that use Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] to
   negotiate, the connection URI can be indicated by means of an SDP
   attribute.  This specification defines new SDP attributes to indicate
   the connection URI for the WebSocket client.  Applications that use
   SDP for negotiation and WebSocket as a transport protocol can use
   this specification to advertise the WebSocket client connection URI.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  SDP Considerations

3.1.  General

   Applications that use the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism [RFC3264] for
   negotiating media and also use WebSocket or secure WebSocket as a
   transport protocol MAY indicate the connection URI for the WebSocket
   client via a new SDP "a=" media-level attribute defined in
   Section 3.2.

RFC 8124                 WebSocket SDP Attribute              March 2017


3.2.  "websocket-uri" SDP Attribute

   This section defines a new SDP media-level attribute, "websocket-
   uri", which can appear in any of the media sections.

   Example:

      a=websocket-uri:wss://example.com/chat

   Where "wss://example.com/chat" is the ws-URI defined in Section 3 of
   [RFC6455].

   When the "websocket-uri" attribute is present in the media section of
   the SDP, the IP address in "c=" line SHALL be ignored and the full
   URI SHALL be used instead to open the WebSocket connection.  The
   clients MUST ensure that they use the URI to open the WebSocket
   connection and ignore the IP address in the "c=" line and the port in
   the "m=" line.

3.3.  "websocket-uri" Multiplexing Considerations

   Multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes are described in
   [SDP-MUX].  Various SDP attribute multiplexing categories are
   introduced there.

   o  The multiplexing category of the "a=websocket-uri" attribute is
      CAUTION.

   There are no multiplexing rules specified for the "websocket-uri" SDP
   media-level attribute.  Additionally, the specification of
   multiplexing rules for the "websocket-uri" attribute is outside the
   scope of this document.

   While it is technically possible to bundle WebSocket, there are a
   variety of reasons that make it impractical; thus, it is considered
   unlikely to be used in practice.  Therefore, the "websocket-uri" SDP
   media-level attribute defined in Section 3.2 for using WebSocket as a
   transport protocol is not likely to be used with SDP bundle and is
   consequently categorized as CAUTION for multiplexing.

   If future extensions define how to bundle WebSocket, then
   multiplexing rules for the "a=websocket-uri" attribute need to be
   defined as well, for instance, in an extension of this SDP based
   WebSocket negotiation specification.

4.  SDP Offer/Answer Procedures

4.1.  General

   An endpoint (i.e., both the offerer and the answerer) that wishes to
   negotiate WebSocket as transport protocol MUST indicate that it
   wishes to use WebSocket or secure WebSocket in the "proto" field of
   the "m=" line.  Furthermore, the server side, which could be either
   the offerer or answerer, MUST add an "a=websocket-uri" attribute in
   the media section whose value can be either "ws-URI" or "wss-URI", as
   defined in Section 3 of [RFC6455], depending on whether it wishes to
   use WebSocket or secure WebSocket.  This new attribute MUST follow
   the syntax defined in Section 3.  The procedures in this section
   apply to an "m=" line associated with any media stream that uses
   WebSocket or secure WebSocket as transport.

   Both offerer or answerer can initiate a WebSocket connection.  It is
   expected that, based on the topology (for example, if the client is
   behind NAT and server is on global IP address), the offerer and
   answerer applications decide on who will initiate the WebSocket
   connection and appropriately set the "setup" attribute in SDP
   following the procedures of [RFC4145].

4.2.  Generating the Initial Offer

   In order to negotiate WebSocket as a transport, an SDP offerer MUST
   indicate that it wishes to use it in the "proto" field of the "m="
   line.  For example, to negotiate BFCP-over-WebSocket, the "proto"
   value in the "m=" line is TCP/WSS/BFCP if WebSocket is over TLS;
   else, it is TCP/WS/BFCP, as specified in [BFCP-WEBSOCKET].

   The offerer SHOULD assign the SDP "setup" attribute with a value of
   "active" (the offerer will be the initiator of the outgoing TCP
   connection) or "passive" if the offerer wishes to be a receiver of an
   incoming connection.  The offerer MUST NOT assign an SDP "setup"
   attribute with a "holdconn" value.  The offerer MUST follow the
   procedures described in [RFC4145]  while using the "setup" attribute.
   If the "setup" attribute has a value of "passive", it MUST have a URI
   in the "a=websocket-uri" attribute.












Ravindranath & Salgueiro     Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 8124                 WebSocket SDP Attribute              March 2017


   The following is an example of an "m=" line for a BFCP connection:

   Offer (browser):
   m=application 9 TCP/WSS/BFCP *
   a=setup:active
   a=connection:new
   a=floorctrl:c-only
   m=audio 55000 RTP/AVP 0
   m=video 55002 RTP/AVP 31

   In the above example, the client is intending to set up the TLS/TCP
   connection; hence, the port is set to a value of 9, which is the
   discard port.

4.3.  Generating the Answer

   If the answerer accepts the offered WebSocket transport connection,
   in the associated SDP answer, the answerer MUST assign an SDP "setup"
   attribute with a value of either "active" or "passive", according to
   the procedures in [RFC4145].  The answerer MUST NOT assign an SDP
   "setup" attribute with a value of "holdconn".

   If the answerer assigns an SDP "setup" attribute with a value of
   "active", the answerer MUST initiate the WebSocket connection
   handshake by acting as client on the negotiated media stream, towards
   the URI specified in the "a=websocket-uri" SDP attribute using the
   procedures described in Section 4 of [RFC6455].

   If the answerer assigns an SDP "setup" attribute with a value of
   "passive", then it MUST have a value of "ws-URI" or "wss-URI", as
   defined in Section 3 of [RFC6455] in an "a=websocket-uri" SDP
   attribute, depending on whether the application uses WebSocket or
   secure WebSocket.  This attribute MUST follow the syntax defined in
   Section 3.

RFC 8124                 WebSocket SDP Attribute              March 2017


   The following example shows a case where the server responds with a
   BFCP media stream over a WebSocket connection running TLS.  It shows
   an answer "m=" line for the BFCP connection.  In this example, since
   WebSocket is running over TLS, the server answers back with an
   "a=websocket-uri" attribute in the media section of SDP having a
   "wss-URI" connection URI:

   Answer (server):
   m=application 50000 TCP/WSS/BFCP *
   a=setup:passive
   a=connection:new
   a=websocket-uri:wss://bfcp-ws.example.com?token=3170449312
   a=floorctrl:s-only
   a=confid:4321
   a=userid:1234
   a=floorid:1 m-stream:10
   a=floorid:2 m-stream:11
   m=audio 50002 RTP/AVP 0
   a=label:10
   m=video 50004 RTP/AVP 31
   a=label:11

4.4.  Offerer Processing of the Answer

   When the offerer receives an SDP answer, if the offerer ends up
   initiating the TCP connection, then it MUST follow the procedures in
   Section 5.

4.5.  Modifying the Session

   Once an offer/answer exchange has been completed, either endpoint MAY
   send a new offer in order to modify the session.  The endpoints can
   reuse the existing WebSocket connection by adding an
   "a=connection:existing" attribute in the media section of the SDP
   following the rules mentioned in [RFC4145], if the "websocket-uri"
   SDP value and the transport parameters indicated by each endpoint are
   unchanged.  Otherwise, following the rules for the initial offer/
   answer exchange, the endpoints can negotiate and create a new
   WebSocket connection on top of TLS/TCP or TCP.

RFC 8124                 WebSocket SDP Attribute              March 2017


4.6.  Offerless INVITE Scenarios

   In some scenarios, an endpoint (e.g., a browser) originating the call
   (a User Agent Client or UAC) can send an offerless INVITE to the
   server.  The server will generate an offer in response to the INVITE.
   In such cases, the server MUST send an offer with the "setup"
   attribute with a value of "passive" so as to accept incoming
   connection and MUST include an "a=websocket-uri" attribute in the
   media section whose value MUST be either "ws-URI" or "wss-URI",
   depending on whether the server wishes to use WebSocket or secure
   WebSocket.  The SDP offer sent by the server will look like the
   example in Section 4.3.

5.  Procedures at WebSocket Client

   The WebSocket client MUST always initiate the outgoing TCP
   connection; hence, the SDP "setup" attribute MUST always be "active"
   for the WebSocket client in its SDP offer/answer.  In the example
   below, the WebSocket client is the offerer; hence, it assigns a
   "setup" attribute with a value of "active".

   The WebSocket server is a server on the Internet; hence, it MUST
   always assign an SDP "setup" attribute with a value of "passive".
   This also avoids the need to use Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) between WebSocket client and WebSocket server, as
   the connection model here would be a typical client-to-server web
   connection.

   Once the offer/answer is complete, the client MUST initiate the
   WebSocket connection handshake by sending a GET message on the
   negotiated media stream, towards the URI specified in an
   "a=websocket-uri" attribute, as per the procedures described in
   [RFC6455].  When no port is passed in the "a=websocket-uri"
   attribute, the default port (80 or 443) is used depending on whether
   the value was "ws-URI" or "wss-URI".

6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove an
   "a=websocket-uri" attribute from a session description.  This could
   result in an application behaving undesirably.  Consequently, it is
   RECOMMENDED that integrity protection be applied to the SDP session
   descriptions.  For session descriptions carried in SIP [RFC3261],
   S/MIME is available to provide such end-to-end integrity protection.

   As described in Section 10 of [RFC6455], application signalling
   traffic being transported over WebSocket MUST support secure
   WebSocket and SHOULD employ it when communicating with their peers.

   The WebSocket clients have to initiate the TCP connection to the
   WebSocket server identified by the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
   in an "a=websocket-uri" attribute.  Further, as with any other web
   connection, the clients will verify the server's certificate.  The
   WebSocket client MUST follow the procedures in [RFC7525] (including
   host name verification as per Section 6.1 in [RFC7525]) while setting
   up a TLS connection with a WebSocket server.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of the "websocket-uri" SDP Media Attribute

   This document defines a new SDP media-level attribute "websocket-uri"
   in Section 3.2; IANA has registered the following SDP att-field under
   the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry as
   follows:

   +---------------------+---------------------------------------------+
   | Attribute name:     | websocket-uri                               |
   | Long-form attribute | WebSocket Connection URI                    |
