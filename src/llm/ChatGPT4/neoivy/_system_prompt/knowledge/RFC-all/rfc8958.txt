1.  Introduction

   Part Five of the Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [RFC3405]
   describes the registration procedures for assignments in URI.ARPA.
   The document requires that registrations be in the "IETF tree" of URI
   registrations.  The use of URI scheme name trees was defined in RFC
   2717 [RFC2717] but discontinued by RFC 4395 [RFC4395] and its
   successors.  Since the use of trees was discontinued, there is no way
   in the current process set out in BCP 35 [RFC7595] to meet the
   requirement to register within that tree.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updated Requirements

   This document removes the normative requirement from RFC 3405
   [RFC3405] for registrations in URI.ARPA to be from the IETF URI tree.

   All registrations in URI.ARPA MUST now be for schemes that are
   permanent registrations, as described in BCP 35.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This entire document is updated instructions to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This update does not change the security considerations in RFC 3405
   [RFC3405].
