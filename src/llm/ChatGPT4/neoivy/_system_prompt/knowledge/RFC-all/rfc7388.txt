1.  Introduction

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols.  In particular it
   defines objects for managing IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal
   Area Networks (6LoWPANs) [RFC4944].

   While a MIB module provides a direct binding for accessing data via
   the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [RFC3410], supporting
   SNMP may not always be affordable on constrained devices.  Other
   protocols to access data modeled in MIB modules are possible and
   proposals have been made recently to provide bindings to the
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document specifies a
   MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

4.  Overview

   The left part of Figure 1 provides an overview of the IETF protocols
   designed for constrained devices.  The right part lists the MIB
   modules providing monitoring and troubleshooting support ([RFC4113],
   [RFC4292], [RFC4293], and [RFC2863]).  The LOWPAN-MIB defined in this
   document fills a hole by providing monitoring and troubleshooting
   support for the 6LoWPAN layer.

                 Figure 1: Protocol Layers and MIB Modules

   The LOWPAN-MIB module is primarily a collection of counters that
   reflect how 6LoWPAN datagrams are processed by the 6LoWPAN layer.
   The objects are defined twice: once to report the global statistics
   as seen by the 6LoWPAN layer and once to report per-interface 6LoWPAN
   layer statistics.  The per-interface statistics are optional to
   implement.  The object identifier registration tree has the following
   structure:

               Figure 2: Object Identifier Registration Tree

   The counters defined in the LOWPAN-MIB module provide information
   about the 6LoWPAN datagrams received and transmitted and how they are
   processed in the 6LoWPAN layer.  For link layers that use the 6LoWPAN
   dispatch byte as defined in [RFC4944] (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4), a
   6LoWPAN datagram is a datagram with a dispatch byte matching the bit
   patterns 01xxxxxx, 10xxxxxx, or 11xxxxxx.  Datagrams with a dispatch
   byte matching the bit pattern 00xxxxxx (NALP - not a LoWPAN frame)
   are not considered to be 6LoWPAN datagrams by this specification.
   Other radio technologies may use different mechanisms to identify
   6LoWPAN datagrams (e.g., the BLUETOOTH Low-Energy Logical Link
   Control and Adaptation Protocol uses Channel Identifiers
   [IPV6-BTLE]).

   The Case Diagram [CASE] in Figure 3 illustrates the conceptual
   relationships between the counters.  Implementations may choose to
   implement the processing of 6LoWPAN datagrams in a different order.

   The generic InDiscards and OutDiscards counters can be incremented
   anytime 6LoWPAN datagrams are discarded due to reasons not covered by
   the other more specific counters.  For example, an implementation

   discarding 6LoWPAN datagrams while all buffers are used for ongoing
   packet reassemblies will increment the relevant InDiscards counters
   for each discarded 6LoWPAN datagram.

       Figure 3: Conceptual Relationship between LOWPAN-MIB Counters

   The fragmentation-related counters have been modeled after the
   fragmentation-related counters of the IP-MIB [RFC4293].  The discard
   counters have been placed at the end of the input and output chains,
   but they can be bumped any time if a datagram is discarded for a
   reason not covered by the other counters.

   The compression-related counters provide insights into compression
   requests and, in particular, compression-related failures.  Note that
   the diagram is conceptual in the sense that compression happens after
   reassembly for incoming 6LoWPAN datagrams, and compression happens



Schoenwaelder, et al.        Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 7388                       LOWPAN-MIB                   October 2014


   before fragmentation for outgoing 6LoWPAN datagrams.  Implementations
   may choose to implement things slightly differently.  For example,
   implementations may decompress FRAG1 fragments as soon as they are
   received, not waiting for reassembly to complete.

   The counters related to MESH header processing do not have an
   explicit discard counter.  Implementations that do not support mesh
   forwarding MUST count the number of received 6LoWPAN datagrams with a
   MESH header (lowpanInMeshReceives), but they MUST NOT increment the
   lowpanInMeshReceives and lowpanInMeshDelivers counters if these
   6LoWPAN datagrams are dropped.

5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The MIB module imports definitions from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], and IF-MIB [RFC2863].

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   The read-only counters provide insights into the amount of 6LoWPAN
   traffic a node is receiving or transmitting.  This might provide
   information regarding whether a device is regularly exchanging
   information with other devices or whether a device is mostly not
   participating in any communication (e.g., the device might be
   "easier" to take away unnoticed).  The reassembly counters could be
   used to direct denial-of-service attacks on the reassembly mechanism.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.




Schoenwaelder, et al.        Standards Track                   [Page 24]

RFC 7388                       LOWPAN-MIB                   October 2014


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
