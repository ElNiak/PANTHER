1.  Introduction

   This document creates an IANA registry for the response codes for the
   MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control Package [RFC6231].

2.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations, other than those described in
   the MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control Package [RFC6231].

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the "MEDIACTRL Interactive Voice Response Control
   Package Status Codes" registry per this document.  New status codes
   are assigned using the Standards Action process defined in RFC 5226
   [RFC5226].
