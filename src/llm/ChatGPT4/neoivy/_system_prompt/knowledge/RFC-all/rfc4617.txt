Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace that
   is engineered by a consortium (general contractor, Olimps LTD, and
   subcontractors, ABC software LTD, Microsoft Latvia LTD, Riga Internet
   eXchange (RIX) Technologies LTD, and Microlink LTD) for naming
   information resources published and produced by the Latvian National
   Government Integration Project (Latvian abbreviation IVIS).

RFC 4617                  IVIS URN Definition                August 2006


1.  Introduction

   The IVIS uses and produces many kinds of information resources such
   as E-services, E-service instances, specifications, standards,
   working documents, and XML schemas.  An ID in IVIS has to be unique
   for global use every time.

2.  Specification Template

   Namespace ID:

      "IVIS" requested according to [RFC3406].

   Registration information:

      Registration Version Number: 1
      Registration Date: 2006-MM-DD

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

   Organization: ABC software LTD on behalf of The Secretariat of the
      Special Assignments Minister for Electronic Government Affairs
   Name: Jurijs Kornijenko
   Title: Software Architect
   Address: Tallinas - 51, Riga, LV-1012
   Phone: +371 7082635
   Email: j.kornienko@abcsoftware.lv

   Declaration of structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs assigned by the
      IVIS will have the following hierarchical structure (ABNF,
      according to [RFC4234]):

<NID> ::= "IVIS"

<NSS>            ::= <IVIS Org ID>:<ResID - suffix>

<IVIS Org ID>    ::= 1*<number>    { subsystem ID from IVIS database}

<ResID - suffix> ::= 1*(<upper> | <lower> | <number> | <other>)
{an ID generated by IVIS subsystem that is unique within
this subsystem}

RFC 4617                  IVIS URN Definition                August 2006


<other>          ::= "(" | ")" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." |
                     "=" | "@" | ";" | "$" |
                     "_" | "!" | "*"

<upper>          ::= "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" |
                     "I" | "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" |
                     "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" |
                     "Y" | "Z"

<lower>          ::= "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" |
                     "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" |
                     "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" |
                     "y" | "z"

<number>         ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
                     "8" | "9"

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      IVIS ancillary documentation is under development.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      Uniqueness is guaranteed by the IVIS that issues the numbers.  The
      numbers are not reassigned.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      Persistence of identifiers is dependent upon the persistence of
      the system name assignment by system name holders.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      All the assignments of identifiers are fully controlled and
      managed by the IVIS and its subsystems.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The holders of system names are responsible for operating or
      delegating resolution servers for the system in which they have
      assigned URNs.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The entire URN is case insensitive.

RFC 4617                  IVIS URN Definition                August 2006


   Conformity with URN syntax:

      IVIS schema URN fully conforms to [RFC2141] syntax, except that
      symbols "'" and ":" were excluded from <other>.

   Validation mechanism:

      <IVIS Org ID> could be validated by using a special IVIS database
      service. <ResID - suffix> could be validated by an appropriate
      subsystem.

   Scope:

      Global.

3.  Example

   The following examples are not to be real.  They are provided for
   pedagogical purposes only.

      URN:IVIS:000000:DOC-METADATA
      URN:IVIS:000000:NDR1021365

4.  Community Considerations

   Every Latvian ministry's local authority produces many kinds of
   different documents, offers public services.  Each of the information
   resources is already uniquely identified within an authority-
   producer.  The IVIS URN namespace helps unify information resource
   identifiers by using existent Latvian government authority
   identification procedures to produce E-services and different
   documents where many parties are involved.  Any citizen or
   organization with Internet web browser capability will be entitled to
   access the namespace and its associated application, registration,
   and resolution services.  The primary IVIS namespace usage is to
   identify information resources, such as XML messages, their schemas,
   and other resources, which can be public or have a special
   destination, when a few different parties are involved in the
   interchange.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes a RUN Network Identifier (NID) registration
   for IVIS for entry in the IANA registry of URN NIDs (see [RFC2434]
   for more information).

6.  Namespace Considerations

   To select necessary identifier schema, we spend a lot time and
   decided on URN, because an IVIS URN namespace has to resolve the
   following problems:

   - Information resource uniqueness

      Uniqueness makes it possible to find a necessary resource and call
      it anytime.  Uniqueness gives stability in message sending and
      storing operations.

   - Namespace understandability

      IVIS URN consists of parts, which can guarantee namespace
      legibility.

   - Information resource resolution

      One of the IVIS namespace parts identifies the place where the
      resource can be found (resolved).

      Therefore, a new URN assignment is required, and individual URNs
      shall be assigned through the process of development of each XML
      schema.

7.  Security Considerations

      There are no additional security considerations besides those
      normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in
      general.

8.  Acknowledgements

      Since the specification described in this document is derived from
      [RFC3305], [RFC3616], [RFC3986], [RFC3622], and [RFC3406] the
      acknowledgements in those documents still apply.  In addition, the
      author wishes to acknowledge Leslie Daigle, Ted Hardie, and Dinara
      Suleymanova for their suggestions and review.
