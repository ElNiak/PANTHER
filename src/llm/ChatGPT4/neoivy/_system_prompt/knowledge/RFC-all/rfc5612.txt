                Enterprise Number for Documentation Use

Abstract

   This document describes an Enterprise Number (also known as SMI
   Network Management Private Enterprise Code) for use in documentation.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 1065 [RFC1065] (later superceded by [RFC1155] and [RFC2578])
   created a subtree (arc) of object identifiers (OIDs) for identifying
   management objects that are defined unilaterally by a single party,
   such as an enterprise.  The subtree for a particular enterprise
   consists of the prefix "1.3.6.1.4.1.", followed by the Enterprise
   Number assigned for that enterprise.

   Enterprise Numbers are allocated by IANA, and are also known as
   "Private Enterprise Numbers", "Enterprise Codes", and "SMI (Structure
   of Management Information) Network Management Private Enterprise
   Codes".  See the "Private Enterprise Number Application Form"
   [Application] for more information on how to request an Enterprise
   Number from IANA, and [Numbers] for the list of currently assigned
   numbers.

RFC 5612        Enterprise Number for Documentation Use      August 2009


   Enterprise Numbers have also been used for many other purposes than
   OIDs in various protocols; for example:

   o  "STRUCTURED-DATA" identifiers in Syslog [RFC5424]
   o  "Vendor-Specific" RADIUS attributes [RFC2865]
   o  Mobile IPv4 vendor/organization-specific extensions [RFC3115]
   o  User-defined error information in RSVP [RFC5284]
   o  Vendor options in DHCPv4 [RFC3925]
   o  Enterprise-specific information elements in the IP Flow
      Information Export (IPFIX) protocol [RFC5101]

   Documents related to these protocols may include examples that
   contain Enterprise Numbers.  To reduce the likelihood of conflict and
   confusion, this document specifies an Enterprise Number for use in
   examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.

   This Enterprise Number is not intended to be implemented.  It is not
   expected that any implementation would send it, or that any
   implementation would treat it specially when receiving it.

2.  Enterprise Number for Documentation Use

   The Enterprise Number 32473 has been allocated for use in examples in
   RFCs, books, documentation, and the like.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated the registration for Enterprise Number 32473 to
   point to this RFC.

4.  Security Considerations

   Allocating an enterprise number for documentation use does not have
   any direct impact on security.

5.  Acknowledgments

   The need for an Enterprise Number for documentation use was
   identified by Rainer Gerhards for the examples in [RFC5424].  The
   authors would also like to thank Michelle Cotton for her help, and
   Alfred Hoenes for his comments.  This document borrows text from
   [RFC5398] and ideas from [RFC4735].
