                          Protocol Information

   This file contains information on the various protocols in the ARPA
   Network.  An effort will be made to keep the information current, but
   this depends on the cooperation of the users of this file to convey
   any information about protocol developments, or corrections to this
   information to Jon Postel at SRI-ARC.

   This is a compendium of all the protocol related activity and most of
   this activity is with experimental protocols, for those protocols,
   which are official standards the designation "[Official]" will be
   appended to the name.

   Much of the documentation of protocols appears as Requests for
   Comments (RFCs) and many of these are available online.  When a
   document is accessible online, a pointer to that source will be
   given.  Also note that recent RFCs are online at Office-1 in
   directory <NETINFO> with names of the form RFCnnn.TXT where nnn is
   replaced by the RFC number.

   This file is online as:

            The "link number" filed has been extended from 8 to 12 bits
            and renamed the "message identification" field.  Message
            type 6 now is used to indicate a reason for a type 7
            (destination dead) message. (See BBN1822).

            There has been some recent changes to the Ready line
            interpretation by the IMP for deciding the alive/dead status
            of a host.

            Important changes to the IMP and IMP/HOST interface

            The BBN TIP and TENEX groups have specified and are
            implementing additional protocol commands with the intention
            of providing better reliability and survivability over
            system malfunctions.  The additional protocol commands are
            for cleaning up partly closed connections and
            resynchronizing the allocation values on open connections.

         Some experiments now running.  Implementation of full protocol
         to begin by 15-Oct-74.

      Recent developments:

         Specification completed August 4th, but some work still in
         progress on handling of single message conversations.  A new
         sequencing scheme (proposed by Tomlinson) may be utilized.  The
         addressing field is now used as 4-bit format, 4-bit network, 16
         bit TCP, and 24 bit process&port.  Crocker has suggested a 64-
         bit path address to be parsed and reformatted by the gateways
         along the route.  There is reluctance to experiment with too
         many things at one though.

         (28-Oct-74) A file indicating some of the changes in the
         specifications since the 4-Aug-74 document is now available as
         [ISI] <CERF> TCP-CHANGES.  The areas of change are "Initial
         Sequence Number", "Socket definition", "Additional user System
         Calls", "Packet format", and "Discussion of opening and closing
         (SYN,REL)".

         (23-NOV-74) Specifications for test implementation are now said
         to be ready on 1-DEC-74, and an implementation completed by 1-
         FEB-74.

               All Hosts were to have been running the new Telnet (both
               user and server) by 1 January 1974.

            Recent developments:

               A significant number of server systems now have new
               telnet implementations. (See RFC 702).

                  Note: the server program is to be available on socket
                  23 decimal (27 octal).

               The Status Option has been revised to take advantage of
               the subcommand feature and to reduce the amount of data
               transmitted to report the option status.

               Seven new options have been defined to allow control of
               the format effectors Carriage Return, Line Feed, Form
               Feed, Horizontal Tab, and Vertical Tab.

NATIONAL SOFTWARE WORKS

   The National Software Works is developing a set of protocols for its
   use of the ARPA Network, other uses of these protocols is encouraged.

   The procedure call protocol is intended to facilitate the sharing of
   resources in the network at the subroutine level.  The procedure call
   protocol will be used to split nls into a front end and back end
   components.  Procedure call protocol is also to be used in the nsw as
   the basis for communication between the works manager, the tool
   bearing hosts, and front desk procedure packages.

   The documents cited below give a view of the Procedure Call Protocol
   and its use.

         Jim White (WHITE@SRI-ARC)

         Jon Postel (POSTEL@SIR-ARC)

      Documents:

         These documents are the second published version of the
         Procedure Call Protocol and NSW protocol - PCP/NSW Version 2.
         Version 2 is SUBSTANTIALLY different than Version 1; it and all
         intermediate, informally distributed PCP/NSW documents are
         obsoleted by this release.

         The first document, PCP, is the place the interested ready
         should start.  It gives the required motivation for the use
         Protocol and states the substance of the Protocol proper.  The
         ready may then, if he chooses, read the next three documents:
         PIP, PSP, and PMP.  The latter has the most to offer the casual
         reader; the programmer faced with coding in the PCP environment
         should ready all three.  The next three documents - PCPFMT,

         PCPHST, and PCPFRK - are of interest only to the PCP
         implementer.  The next document - HOST - is a preliminary
         thought about how the NSW might use the standard HOST-HOST
         protocol NCP.  The last four documents - EXEC, FILE, BATCH, and
         LLDBUG - describe procedure packages needed to carry out NSW
         functions, but such packages may well be useful in other
         contexts.

         Version 2 consists of the following documents.  Each is
         available online in two forms: as an NLS file and as a
         formatted text file.  The journal number (e.g., 24459) refers
         to the former, of course and the pathname (e.g., [SRI-ARI]
         <NLS> PCP.TXT) to the latter, accessible via FTP using
         USER=ANONYMOUS and PASSWORD=GUEST (no account required).
         Hardcopy is being forwarded by US Mail to all those who have
         expressed an interest in PCP.  If you don't receive a copy and
         would like one of this and/or future releases, send a note to
