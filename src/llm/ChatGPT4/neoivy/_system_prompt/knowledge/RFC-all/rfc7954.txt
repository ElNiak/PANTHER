 Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Endpoint Identifier (EID) Block

Abstract

   This document directs IANA to allocate a /32 IPv6 prefix for use with
   the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP).  The prefix will be used
   for local intra-domain routing and global endpoint identification, by
   sites deploying LISP as Endpoint Identifier (EID) addressing space.

RFC 7954                     LISP EID Block               September 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document directs the IANA to allocate a /32 IPv6 prefix for use
   with the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP [RFC6830]), LISP Map-
   Server ([RFC6833]), LISP Alternative Topology (LISP+ALT [RFC6836])
   (or other) mapping systems, and LISP Interworking ([RFC6832]).

   This block will be used as global Endpoint Identifier (EID) space.

2.  Definition of Terms

   The present document does not introduce any new terms with respect to
   the set of LISP Specifications ([RFC6830], [RFC6831], [RFC6832],
   [RFC6833], [RFC6834], [RFC6835], [RFC6836], [RFC6837]), but it
   assumes that the reader is familiar with the LISP terminology.
   [LISP-INTRO] provides an introduction to the LISP technology,
   including its terminology.

3.  Rationale and Intent

   Discussion within the LISP working group led to the identification of
   several scenarios in which the existence of a LISP-specific address
   block brings technical benefits.  The most relevant scenarios are
   described below:

   Early LISP destination detection:  With the current specifications,
         there is no direct way to detect whether or not a certain
         destination is in a LISP domain without performing a LISP
         mapping lookup.  For instance, if an Ingress Tunnel Router
         (ITR) is sending packets to all types of destinations (i.e.,
         non-LISP destinations, LISP destinations not in the IPv6 EID
         block, and LISP destinations in the IPv6 EID block), the only
         way to understand whether or not to encapsulate the traffic is
         to perform a cache lookup and, in case of a LISP cache miss,
         send a Map-Request to the mapping system.  In the meanwhile
         (while waiting for the Map-Reply), packets may be dropped to
         avoid excessive buffering.

   Avoid penalizing non-LISP traffic:  In certain circumstances, it
         might be desirable to configure a router using LISP features to
         natively forward all packets that do not have a destination
         address in the block and, hence, no lookup whatsoever is
         performed and packets destined to non-LISP sites are not
         penalized in any manner.

RFC 7954                     LISP EID Block               September 2016


   Traffic Engineering:  In some deployment scenarios, it might be
         desirable to apply different traffic-engineering policies for
         LISP and non-LISP traffic.  A LISP-specific EID block would
         allow improved traffic-engineering capabilities with respect to
         LISP vs. non-LISP traffic.  In particular, LISP traffic might
         be identified without having to use Deep Packet Inspection
         (DPI) techniques in order to parse the encapsulated packet.
         Instead, performing a simple inspection of the outer header is
         sufficient.

   Transition Mechanism:  The existence of a LISP-specific EID block may
         prove useful in transition scenarios.  A non-LISP domain would
         ask for an allocation in the LISP EID block and use it to
         deploy LISP in its network.  Such allocation would not be
         announced in the BGP routing infrastructure (cf. Section 4).
         This approach will allow non-LISP domains to avoid fragmenting
         their already allocated non-LISP addressing space, which may
         lead to BGP routing table inflation since it may (rightfully)
         be announced in the BGP routing infrastructure.

   Limit the impact on the BGP routing infrastructure:  As described in
         the previous scenario, LISP adopters will avoid fragmenting
         their addressing space, since fragmentation would negatively
         impact the BGP routing infrastructure.  Adopters will use
         addressing space from the EID block, which might be announced
         in large aggregates and in a tightly controlled manner only by
         Proxy Tunnel Routers (PxTRs).

   It is worth mentioning that new use cases may arise in the future,
   due to new and unforeseen scenarios.

   Furthermore, the use of a dedicated address block allows for tighter
   control over the traffic in the initial experimental phase
   (especially filtering), while facilitating its large-scale
   deployment.

   [RFC3692] considers assigning experimental and testing numbers
   useful; having a reserved IPv6 prefix enables this practice.  The
   present document follows the guidelines provided in [RFC3692], with
   one exception.  [RFC3692] suggests the use of values similar to those
   called "Private Use" in [RFC5226], which by definition are not
   unique.  One purpose of the present request to IANA is to guarantee
   uniqueness to the EID block.  The lack thereof would result in a lack
   of real utility of a reserved IPv6 prefix.

RFC 7954                     LISP EID Block               September 2016


4.  Expected Use

   Sites planning to deploy LISP may request a prefix in the IPv6 EID
   block.  Such prefixes will be used for routing and endpoint
   identification inside the site requesting it.  Mappings related to
   such a prefix, or part of it, will be made available through the
   mapping system in use and registered to one or more Map-Server(s).

   The EID block must be used for LISP experimentation and must not be
   advertised in the form of more specific route advertisements in the
   non-LISP inter-domain routing environment.  Interworking between the
   EID block sub-prefixes and the non-LISP Internet is done according to
   the techniques described in [RFC6832] and [RFC7215].

   As the LISP adoption progresses, the EID block may potentially have a
   reduced impact on the BGP routing infrastructure, compared to the
   case of having the same number of adopters using global unicast space
   allocated by Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) ([MobiArch2007]).
   From a short-term perspective, the EID block offers potentially large
   aggregation capabilities since it is announced by Proxy Tunnel
   Routers (PxTRs), possibly concentrating several contiguous prefixes.
   This trend should continue with even lower impact from a long-term
   perspective, because more aggressive aggregation can be used,
   potentially leading to using fewer PxTRs announcing the whole EID
   block ([FIABook2010]).

   The EID block will be used only at the configuration level, so it is
   recommended not to hard-code the IPv6 EID block in the router
   hardware in any way.  This prevents locking out sites that may want
   to switch to LISP while keeping their own IPv6 prefix, which is not
   in the IPv6 EID block.  Furthermore, in the case of a future
   permanent allocation, the allocated prefix may differ from the
   experimental temporary prefix allocated during the experimentation
   phase.

   With the exception of the Proxy Ingress Tunnel Router (PITR) case
   (described in Section 8), prefixes out of the EID block must not be
   announced in the BGP routing infrastructure.

5.  Block Dimension

   The working group reached consensus on an initial allocation of a /32
   prefix.  The reason of such consensus is manifold:

   o  The working group agreed that the /32 prefix is sufficiently large
      to cover initial allocation and requests for prefixes in the EID
      space in the next few years for very large-scale experimentation
      and deployment.



Iannone, et al.               Experimental                      [Page 5]

RFC 7954                     LISP EID Block               September 2016


   o  As a comparison, it is worth mentioning that the current LISP Beta
      Network ([BETA]) is using a /32 prefix, with more than 250 sites
      using a /48 sub-prefix.  Hence, a /32 prefix appears sufficiently
      large to allow the current deployment to scale up and be open for
      interoperation with independent deployments using the EIDs in the
      new /32 prefix.

   o  A /32 prefix is sufficiently large to allow deployment of
      independent (commercial) LISP-enabled networks by third parties,
      but may as well boost LISP experimentation and deployment.

   o  The use of a /32 prefix is in line with previous similar prefix
      allocation for tunneling protocols ([RFC3056]).

6.  3+3 Allocation Plan

   Per this document, IANA has initially assigned a /32 prefix out of
   the IPv6 addressing space for use as EID in LISP.

   IANA allocated the requested address space in September 2016 for a
   duration of 3 (three) years (through September 2019), with an option
   to extend this period by 3 (three) more years (until September 2022).
   By the end of the first period, the IETF will provide a decision on
   whether to transform the prefix into a permanent assignment or to put
   it back in the free pool (see Section 7 for more information).

   In the first case, i.e., if the IETF decides to transform the block
   into a permanent allocation, the EID block allocation period will be
   extended for three years (until September 2022) to give the IETF time
   to define the final size of the EID block and create a transition
   plan.  The transition of the EID block into a permanent allocation
   might pose policy issues (as recognized in [RFC2860], Section 4.3);
   therefore, discussion with the IANA, the RIR communities, and the
   IETF community will be necessary to determine the appropriate policy
   for permanent EID-block allocation and management.  Note as well that
   the final permanent allocation may differ from the initial
   experimental assignment; hence, it is recommended not to hard-code
   the experimental EID block on LISP-capable devices in any way.

   In the latter case, i.e., if the IETF decides to terminate the
   experimental-use EID block, all temporary prefix allocations in this
   address range must expire and be released by September 2019, so that
   the entire /32 is returned to the free pool.

   The allocation and management of the EID block for the initial 3-year
   period (and the optional 3 more years) is detailed in [RFC7955].

RFC 7954                     LISP EID Block               September 2016


7.  Allocation Lifetime

   If no explicit action is carried out by the end of the experiment (by
   September 2019), it is automatically considered that there was not
   sufficient interest in having a permanent allocation; therefore, the
   address block will be returned to the free pool.

   Otherwise, if the LISP working group recognizes that there is value
   in having a permanent allocation, then explicit action is needed.

   In order to trigger the process for a permanent allocation, a
   document is required.  Such a document has to articulate the
   rationale for why a permanent allocation would be beneficial.  More
   specifically, the document has to detail the experience gained during
   experimentation and all of the technical benefits provided by the use
   of a LISP-specific prefix.  Such technical benefits are expected to
   lay in the scenarios described in Section 3.  However, new and
   unforeseen benefits may appear during experimentation.  The
   description should be sufficiently articulate that the needed size of
   the permanent allocation can be estimated.  However, note that, as
   explained in Section 6, it is up to IANA to decide which address
   block will be used as a permanent allocation and that such a block
   may be different from the temporary experimental allocation.

8.  Routing Considerations

   In order to provide connectivity between the Legacy Internet and LISP
   sites, PITRs announcing large aggregates (ideally one single, large
   aggregate) of the IPv6 EID block could be deployed.  By doing so,
   PITRs will attract traffic destined for LISP sites in order to
   encapsulate and forward it toward the specific destination LISP site.
   Routers in the Legacy Internet must treat announcements of prefixes
   from the IPv6 EID block as normal announcements, applying best
   current practices for traffic engineering and security.

   Even in a LISP site, not all routers need to run LISP elements.  In
   particular, routers that are not at the border of the local domain,
   used only for intra-domain routing, do not need to provide any
   specific LISP functionality but must be able to route traffic using
   addresses in the IPv6 EID block.

   For the above-mentioned reasons, routers that do not run any LISP
   element must not include any special handling code or hardware for
   addresses in the IPv6 EID block.  In particular, it is recommended
   that the default router configuration not handle such addresses in
   any special way.  Doing differently could prevent communication
   between the Legacy Internet and LISP sites or even break local intra-
   domain connectivity.

9.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce new security threats in the LISP
   architecture nor in the legacy Internet architecture.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a /32 IPv6 prefix for use as the global EID space
   for LISP using a hierarchical allocation as outlined in [RFC5226] and
   summarized in Table 1.  The assigned block is from the 2001:5 global
   unicast space.

   IANA is not requested to issue an AS0 Route Origin Attestation (ROA
   [RFC6491]), because the global EID space is be used for routing
   purposes.

               | Global               | True               |
               | Reserved-by-protocol | True [3]           |
               +----------------------+--------------------+

      [1] According to the 3+3 Plan outlined in this document, the
          termination date can be postponed to September 2022.
      [2] Can be used as a multicast source as well.
      [3] To be used as EID space by routers enabled by LISP [RFC6830].

                            Table 1: Global EID Space

   The reserved address space is requested for an initial 3-year period
   starting in September 2016 (until September 2019), with an option to
   extend it by three years (until September 2022) upon the decision of
   the IETF (see Sections 6 and 7).  Following the policies outlined in
   [RFC5226], upon IETF Review, the decision should be made on whether
   to have a permanent EID block assignment by September 2019.  If no
   explicit action is taken or, if the IETF Review outcome is that it is
   not worth having a reserved prefix as a global EID space, the whole
   /32 will be taken out from the "IANA IPv6 Special-Purpose Address
   Registry" and put back in the free pool managed by IANA.

RFC 7954                     LISP EID Block               September 2016


   Allocation and management of the global EID space is detailed in
   [RFC7955].  Nevertheless, all prefix allocations out of this space
   must be temporary and no allocation must go beyond September 2019
   unless the IETF Review decides for a permanent global EID space
   assignment.
