1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing network interfaces
   based on IEEE 802.12.

2.  Object Definitions

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  MIB modules are written using a subset of Abstract
   Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1] termed the Structure of Management
   Information (SMI) [2].  In particular, each object type is named by
   an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Overview

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an interface
   to an IEEE 802.12 communications medium.  At present, IEEE 802.12
   media are identified by one value of the ifType object in the
   Internet-standard MIB:

      ieee80212(55)

   For this interface, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the MIB-
   II [5] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

      dot12MIB    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { transmission 45 }

   The values for the ifType object are defined by the IANAifType
   textual convention.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   is responsible for the assignment of all Internet numbers, including
   new ifType values.  Therefore, IANA is responsible for maintaining
   the definition of this textual convention.  The current definition of
   the IANAifType textual convention is available from IANA's World Wide
   Web server at:

         http://www.iana.org/iana/

   The definitions presented here are based on the IEEE Standard
   802.12-1995, [6] Clause 13 "Layer management functions and services",
   and Annex C "GDMO Specifications for Demand Priority Managed
   Objects".  Implementors of these MIB objects should note that the
   IEEE document explicitly describes (in the form of Pascal pseudocode)
   when, where, and how various MAC attributes are measured.  The IEEE
   document also describes the effects of MAC actions that may be
   invoked by manipulating instances of the MIB objects defined here.

   To the extent that some of the attributes defined in [6] are
   represented by previously defined objects in the Internet-standard
   MIB [5] or in the Evolution of the Interfaces Group of MIB-II [7],
   such attributes are not redundantly represented by objects defined in
   this memo.  Among the attributes represented by objects defined in
   other memos are the number of octets transmitted or received on a
   particular interface, the MAC address of an interface, and multicast
   information associated with an interface.

3.1.  MAC Addresses

   All representations of MAC addresses in this MIB module, and in other
   related MIB modules (like RFC 1573), are in "canonical" order defined
   by 802.1a, i.e., as if it were transmitted least significant bit
   first.  This is true even if the interface is operating in token ring
   framing mode, which requires MAC addresses to be transmitted most
   significant bit first.

3.2.  Relation to RFC 1213

   This section applies only when this MIB is used in conjunction with
   the "old" (i.e., pre-RFC 1573) interface group.

   The relationship between an IEEE 802.12 interface and an interface in
   the context of the Internet-standard MIB is one-to-one.  As such, the
   value of an ifIndex object instance can be directly used to identify
   corresponding instances of the objects defined herein.

3.3.  Relation to RFC 1573

   RFC 1573, the Interface MIB Evolution, requires that any MIB which is
   an adjunct of the Interface MIB, clarify specific areas within the
   Interface MIB.  These areas are intentionally left vague in RFC 1573
   to avoid over constraining the MIB, thereby precluding management of
   certain media-types.

   An agent which implements this MIB module must support the
   ifGeneralGroup, ifStackGroup, ifHCPacketGroup, and ifRcvAddressGroup
   of RFC 1573.

   Section 3.3 of RFC 1573 enumerates several areas which a media-
   specific MIB must clarify.  In addition, there are some objects in
   RFC 1573 for which additional clarification of how to apply them to
   an IEEE 802.12 interface would be helpful.  Each of these areas is
   addressed in a following subsection.  The implementor is referred to
   RFC 1573 in order to understand the general intent of these areas.

RFC 2020               IEEE 802.12 Interface MIB            October 1996


3.3.1.  Layering Model

   For the typical usage of this MIB module, there will be no sub-layers
   "above" or "below" the 802.12 Interface.  However, this MIB module
   does not preclude such layering.

3.3.2.  Virtual Circuits

   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB.

3.3.3.  ifTestTable

   This MIB does not define any tests for media instrumented by this
   MIB.  Implementation of the ifTestTable is not required.  An
   implementation may optionally implement the ifTestTable to execute
   vendor specific tests.

3.3.4.  ifRcvAddressTable

   This table contains all IEEE addresses, unicast, multicast, and
   broadcast, for which this interface will receive packets and forward
   them up to a higher layer entity for consumption.  In addition, when
   the interface is using 802.5 framing mode, the ifRcvAddressTable will
   contain the functional address mask.

   In the event that the interface is part of a MAC bridge, this table
   does not include unicast addresses which are accepted for possible
   forwarding out some other port.  This table is explicitly not
   intended to provide a bridge address filtering mechanism.

3.3.5.  ifPhysAddress

   This object contains the IEEE 802.12 address which is placed in the
   source-address field of any frames that originate at this interface.
   Usually this will be kept in ROM on the interface hardware.  Some
   systems may set this address via software.

   In a system where there are several such addresses the designer has a
   tougher choice.  The address chosen should be the one most likely to
   be of use to network management (e.g.  the address placed in ARP
   responses for systems which are primarily IP systems).

   If the designer truly can not choose, use of the factory-provided ROM
   address is suggested.

   If the address can not be determined, an octet string of zero length
   should be returned.

RFC 2020               IEEE 802.12 Interface MIB            October 1996


   The address is stored in binary in this object.  The address is
   stored in "canonical" bit order, that is, the Group Bit is positioned
   as the low-order bit of the first octet.  Thus, the first byte of a
   multicast address would have the bit 0x01 set.  This is true even
   when the interface is using token ring framing mode, which transmits
   addresses high-order bit first.

3.3.6.  Specific Interface MIB Objects

   The following table provides specific implementation guidelines for
   the interface group objects in the conformance groups listed above.

     Object                 Use for an 802.12 Interface

     ifIndex                Each 802.12 interface is represented by an
                            ifEntry.  Interface tables in this MIB
                            module are indexed by ifIndex.

     ifDescr                Refer to [7].

     ifType                 The IANA reserved value for 802.12 - 55.

     ifMtu                  The value of ifMtu on an 802.12 interface
                            will depend on the type of framing that is
                            in use on that interface.  Changing the
                            dot12DesiredFramingType may have the effect
                            of changing ifMtu after the next time that
                            the interface trains.  When
                            dot12CurrentFramingType is equal to
                            frameType88023, ifMtu will be equal to
                            1500.  When dot12CurrentFramingType is
                            equal to frameType88025, ifMtu will be
                            4464.

     ifSpeed                The speed of the interface in bits per
                            second.  For current 802.12
                            implementations, this will be equal to
                            100,000,000 (100 million).

     ifPhysAddress          See Section 3.3.5.

     ifAdminStatus          Write access is not required.  Support for
                            'testing' is not required.  Setting this
                            object to 'up' will cause dot12Commands to
                            be set to 'open'.  Setting this object to
                            'down' will cause dot12Commands to be set
                            to 'close'.  Setting dot12Commands to
                            'open' will set this object to 'up'.
                            Setting dot12Commands to 'close' will set
                            this object to 'down'.  Setting
                            dot12Commands to 'reset' will have no
                            effect on this object.

     ifOperStatus           When dot12Status is equal to 'opened', this
                            object will be equal to 'up'.  When
                            dot12Status is equal to 'closed', 'opening',
                            'openFailure' or 'linkFailure', this object
                            will be equal to 'down'.  Support for
                            'testing' is not required, but may be used
                            to indicate that a vendor specific test is
                            in progress.  The value 'dormant' has no
                            meaning for an IEEE 802.12 interface.

     ifInOctets             The number of octets in valid MAC frames
                            received on this interface, including the
                            MAC header and FCS.

                            dot12InOversizeFrameErrors,
                            dot12InDataErrors, and any additional
                            internal errors that may occur in an
                            implementation.

     ifInUnknownProtos      Refer to [7].

     ifOutOctets            The number of octets transmitted in MAC
                            frames on this interface, including the MAC
                            header and FCS.

     ifOutMulticastPkts     Refer to [7].  When dot12CurrentFramingType

     ifHC*Pkts              Not required for 100 MBit interfaces.
                            Future IEEE 802.12 interfaces which operate
                            at higher speeds may require implementation
                            of these counters, but such interfaces are
                            beyond the scope of this memo.

     ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable Refer to [7].  Default is 'enabled'.

     ifHighSpeed            The speed of the interface in millions of
                            bits per second.  For current 802.12
                            implementations, this will be equal to 100.

     ifPromiscuousMode      Reflects whether the interface has
                            successfully trained and is currently
                            operating in promiscuous mode.
                            dot12DesiredPromiscStatus is used to select
                            the promiscuous mode to be requested in the
                            next training attempt.  Setting
                            ifPromiscuousMode will update
                            dot12DesiredPromiscStatus and cause the
                            interface to attempt to retrain using the
                            new promiscuous mode.  After the interface
                            has retrained, ifPromiscuousMode will
                            reflect the mode that is in use, not the
                            mode that was requested.

3.4.  Relation to RFC 1643, RFC 1650, and RFC 1748

   An IEEE 802.12 interface can be configured to operate in either
   ethernet or token ring framing mode.  An IEEE 802.12 interface uses
   the frame format for the configured framing mode, but does not use
   the media access protocol for ethernet or token ring.  Instead, IEEE
   802.12 defines its own media access protocol, the Demand Priority
   Access Method (DPAM).

   There are existing standards-track MIB modules for instrumenting
   ethernet-like interfaces and token ring interfaces.  At the time of
   this writing, they are: STD 50, RFC 1643, "Definitions of Managed
   Objects for Ethernet-like Interface Types" [8]; RFC 1650,
   "Definitions of Managed Objects for Ethernet-like Interface Types
   using SMIv2" [9]; and RFC 1748, "IEEE 802.5 MIB using SMIv2" [10].
   These MIB modules are designed to instrument the media access
   protocol for these respective technologies.  Since IEEE 802.12
   interfaces do not implement either of these media access protocols,
   an agent should not implement RFC 1643, RFC 1650, or RFC 1748 for
   IEEE 802.12 interfaces.

3.5.  Relation to RFC 1749

   When an IEEE 802.12 interface is operating in token ring framing
   mode, and the end node supports token ring source routing, the agent
   should implement RFC 1749, the IEEE 802.5 Station Source Routing MIB
   [11] for those interfaces.

3.6.  Master Mode Operation

   In an IEEE 802.12 network, "master" devices act as network
   controllers to decide when to grant requesting end-nodes permission
   to transmit.  These master devices may be repeaters, or other active
   controller devices such as switches.

   Devices which do not act as network controllers, such as end-nodes or
   passive switches, are considered to be operating in "slave" mode.

   The dot12ControlMode object indicates if the interface is operating
   in master mode or slave mode.

3.7.  Normal and High Priority Counters

   The IEEE 802.12 interface MIB does not provide normal priority
   transmit counters.  Standardization of normal priority transmit
   counters could not be justified -- ifOutUcastPkts,
   ifOutMulticastPkts, ifOutBroadcastPkts, ifOutOctets,
   dot12OutHighPriorityFrames, and dot12OutHighPriorityOctets should
   suffice.  More precisely, the number of normal priority frames
   transmitted can be calculated as:

       outNormPriorityFrames = ifOutUcastPkts             +
                               ifOutMulticastPkts         +
                               ifOutBroadcastPkts         -
                               dot12OutHighPriorityFrames

   The number of normal priority octets transmitted can be calculated
   as:

       outNormPriorityOctets = ifOutOctets                -
                               dot12OutHighPriorityOctets

   On the other hand, normal priority receive counters are provided.
   The main reason for this is that the normal priority and high
   priority counters include errored frames, whereas the ifIn*Pkts and
   ifInOctets do not include errored frames.  dot12InNormPriorityFrames
   could be calculated, but the calculation is tedious:

       inNormPriorityFrames = ifInUcastPkts              +
                              ifInMulticastPkts          +
                              ifInBroadcastPkts          +
                              dot12InNullAddressedFrames +
                              ifInErrors                 +
                              ifInDiscards               +
                              ifInUnknownProtos          -
                              dot12InHighPriorityFrames

   dot12InNormPriorityOctets includes octets in unreadable frames, which
   is not available elsewhere.  The number of octets in unreadable
   frames can be calculated as:

       octetsInUnreadableFrames = dot12InNormPriorityOctets +
                                  dot12InHighPriorityOctets -
                                  ifInOctets

   Also, the total traffic at this interface can be calculated as:

       traffic = dot12InNormPriorityOctets +
                 dot12InHighPriorityOctets +
                 ifOutOctets

   In other words, the normal priority receive counters were deemed
   useful, whereas the normal priority transmit counters can be easily
   calculated from other available counters.

3.8.  IEEE 802.12 Training Frames

   Training frames are special MAC frames that are used only during link
   initialization.  Training frames are initially constructed by the
   device at the lower end of a link, which is the slave mode device for
   the link.  The training frame format is as follows:

       +----+----+------------+--------------+----------+-----+
       | DA | SA | Req Config | Allow Config |   Data   | FCS |
       +----+----+------------+--------------+----------+-----+

               DA = destination address (six octets)
               SA = source address (six octets)
               Req Config = requested configuration (2 octets)
               Allow Config = allowed configuration (2 octets)
               Data = data (594 to 675 octets)
               FCS = frame check sequence (4 octets)

   Training frames are always sent with a null destination address.  To
   pass training, an end node must use its source address in the source
   address field of the training frame.  A repeater may use a non-null
   source address if it has one, or it may use a null source address.

RFC 2020               IEEE 802.12 Interface MIB            October 1996


   The requested configuration field allows the slave mode device to
   inform the master mode device about itself and to request
   configuration options.  The training response frame from the master
   mode device contains the slave mode device's requested configuration
   from the training request frame.  The currently defined format of the
   requested configuration field as defined in the IEEE Standard
   802.12-1995 standard is shown below.  Please refer to the most
   current version of the IEEE document for a more up to date
   description of this field.  In particular, the reserved bits may be
   used in later versions of the standard.

       FF:  00 = frameType88023
            01 = frameType88025
            10 = reserved
            11 = frameTypeEither
       PP:  00 = singleAddressMode
            01 = promiscuousMode
            10 = reserved
            11 = reserved
       R:   0  = the training initiator is an end node
            1  = the training initiator is a repeater

   The allowed configuration field allows the master mode device to
   respond with the allowed configuration.  The slave mode device sets
   the contents of this field to all zero bits.  The master mode device
   sets the allowed configuration field as follows:

       First Octet:       Second Octet:

        7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

       vvv: The version of the 802.12 training protocol with which
            the training responder is compliant.  The current version
            is 100.

       D:   0  = No duplicate address has been detected.
            1  = Duplicate address has been detected
       C:   0  = The requested configuration is compatible with the
                 network.
            1  = The requested configuration is not compatible with
                 the network.  In this case, the FF, PP, and R bits
                 indicate the configuration that would be allowed.
       N:   0  = Access will be allowed, providing the configuration
                 is compatible (C = 0).
            1  = Access is not granted because of security
                 restrictions
       r:   Reserved bits (set to zero)
       FF:  00 = frameType88023 will be used
            01 = frameType88025 will be used
            10 = reserved
            11 = reserved
       PP:  00 = singleAddressMode
            01 = promiscuousMode
            10 = reserved
            11 = reserved
       R:   0  = Requested access as an end node is allowed
            1  = Requested access as a repeater is allowed

   Again, note that the most recent version of the IEEE 802.12 standard
   should be consulted for the most up to date definition of the
   requested configuration and allowed configuration fields.

   The data field contains between 594 and 675 octets and is filled in
   by the training initiator.  The first 55 octets may be used for
   vendor specific protocol information.  The remaining octets are all
   zeros.  The length of the training frame combined with the
   requirement that 24 consecutive training frames be received without
   error to complete training ensures that marginal links will not
   complete training.

                      will be initiated on this interface.  When the
                      value of this object is not equal to 'closed' and

                      training will be reinitiated on this interface.
                      Note that sets of some other objects (e.g.
                      dot12ControlMode) or external events (e.g. MAC
                      protocol violations) may also cause training to be
                      reinitiated on this interface.

                      When training is initiated or reinitiated on an
                      interface, the end node will send Training_Up to
                      the master and initially go to the 'linkFailure'
                      state and ifOperStatus will go to 'down'.
                      When the master sends back Training_Down,
                      dot12Status will change to the 'opening' state,
                      and training packets will be transferred.

                      After all of the training packets have been
                      passed, dot12Status will change to 'linkFailure'
                      if 24 consecutive error-free packets were not
                      passed, 'opened' if 24 consecutive error-free
                      packets were passed and the training
                      configuration bits were OK, or 'openFailure' if
                      there were 24 consecutive error-free packets, but
                      there was a problem with the training
                      configuration bits.

                      When in the 'openFailure' state, the
                      dot12LastTrainingConfig object will contain the
                      configuration bits from the last training
                      packet which can be examined to determine the
                      exact reason for the training configuration
                      failure.

                      If training did not succeed (dot12Status is
