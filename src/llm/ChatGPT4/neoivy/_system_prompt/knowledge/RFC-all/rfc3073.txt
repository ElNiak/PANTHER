Abstract

   This document describes the registration of the Multipurpose Internet
   Mail Extensions (MIME) sub-type application/font-tdpfr.  The encoding
   is defined by the PFR Specification.

   A Portable Font Resource (PFR) contains a set of glyph shapes.  Each
   glyph shape is associated with a character code.  The PFR format is
   designed to be both compact and platform-independent.  It is intended
   to facilitate accurate rendering of fonts in all environments whether
   or not they have the required fonts already installed.

2. Overview

   This document describes the registration of the MIME sub-type
   application/font-tdpfr.  The encoding is defined by [PFR].

3. PFR Definition

   PFR (Portable Font Resource) is defined by Bitstream Inc. in [PFR].

   While a brief scope and feature description is provided in this
   section as background information, the reader is directed to the
   original PFR specification [PFR] to obtain complete feature and
   technical details.

3.1 PFR Scope

   A PFR contains a set of glyph shapes.  Each glyph shape is associated
   with a character code.  The PFR format is designed to be both compact
   and platform-independent.  It is intended to facilitate accurate
   rendering of fonts in environments whether or not they have the
   required fonts already installed.

   The glyph shape definitions in a PFR are resolution-independent.
   This allows glyph definitions to be displayed or printed on devices
   with a wide variety of resolutions.  It also allows glyphs to be
   rendered at any size.

3.2 PFR Features

   Some of the features of the PFR format are:

    - Compact representation of glyph shapes

    - Independent of byte order and operating system

    - Independent of output device resolution

    - Fully scalable to any glyph size

    - Optional inclusion of bitmap glyph images

    - Adopted as the font standard by DAVIC, DVB, and DTG

5. MIME Definition

   The PFR media type has been previously registered with IANA as
   application/vnd.truedoc.  In view of its subsequent widespread
   adoption as a standard font format by multiple standards bodies who
   have relationships with the Internet community, Bitstream has been
   asked to re-register this media type within the IETF tree.

6. IANA Registration

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject: Registration of Standard MIME Media type
       application/font-tdpfr

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: font-tdpfr

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: Binary or base 64 required

   Security considerations:

      PFR uses a structure that can store glyph image data and encoding
      arrays.  The fields defined in the PFR specification are of a
      descriptive nature and provide information that is useful to
      facilitate viewing and rendering of glyph images by a recipient.
      As such, the fields currently defined in the PFR specification do
      not in themselves create additional security risks, since the
      fields are not used to induce any particular behavior by the
      recipient application.

      PFR has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically
      possible that fields could be defined in the future which could be
      used to induce particular actions on the part of the recipient,
      thus presenting additional security risks, but this type of
      capability is not supported in the referenced PFR specification.
      Indeed, the definition of fields that would include such
      processing instructions is inconsistent with the goals and spirit
      of the PFR specification.
