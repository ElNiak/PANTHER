                   SNMPv2 Management Information Base
           for the Transmission Control Protocol using SMIv2

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

IESG Note:

   The IP, UDP, and TCP MIB modules currently support only IPv4.  These
   three modules use the IpAddress type defined as an OCTET STRING of
   length 4 to represent the IPv4 32-bit internet addresses.  (See RFC
   1902, SMI for SNMPv2.)  They do not support the new 128-bit IPv6
   internet addresses.

1.  Introduction

   A management system contains: several (potentially many) nodes, each
   with a processing entity, termed an agent, which has access to
   management instrumentation; at least one management station; and, a
   management protocol, used to convey management information between
   the agents and management stations.  Operations of the protocol are
   carried out under an administrative framework which defines
   authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy policies.

RFC 2012                   SNMPv2 MIB for TCP              November 1996


   Management stations execute management applications which monitor and
   control managed elements.  Managed elements are devices such as
   hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc., which are monitored and
   controlled via access to their management information.

   Management information is viewed as a collection of managed objects,
   residing in a virtual information store, termed the Management
   Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related objects are defined
   in MIB modules.  These modules are written using a subset of OSI's
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [1], termed the Structure of
   Management Information (SMI) [2].

   This document is the MIB module which defines managed objects for
   managing implementations of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   [3].

   The managed objects in this MIB module were originally defined using
   the SNMPv1 framework as a part of MIB-II [4].  This document defines
   the same objects for TCP using the SNMPv2 framework.

            If a management station sets this object to the value

            (as defined in RFC 793) of the corresponding connection on
            the managed node, resulting in immediate termination of the
            connection.
