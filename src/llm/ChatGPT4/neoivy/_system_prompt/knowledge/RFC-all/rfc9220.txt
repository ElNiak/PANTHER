                  Bootstrapping WebSockets with HTTP/3

Abstract

   The mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol over a single stream
   of an HTTP/2 connection is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but the
   HTTP-version-specific details need to be specified.  This document
   describes how the mechanism is adapted for HTTP/3.

1.  Introduction

   "Bootstrapping WebSockets with HTTP/2" [RFC8441] defines an extension
   to HTTP/2 [HTTP/2] that is also useful in HTTP/3 [HTTP/3].  This
   extension makes use of an HTTP/2 setting.  Appendix A.3 of [HTTP/3]
   gives some guidance on what changes (if any) are appropriate when
   porting settings from HTTP/2 to HTTP/3.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  WebSockets Upgrade over HTTP/3

   [RFC8441] defines a mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol
   [RFC6455] over a single stream of an HTTP/2 connection.  It defines
   an Extended CONNECT method that specifies a new ":protocol" pseudo-
   header field and new semantics for the ":path" and ":authority"
   pseudo-header fields.  It also defines a new HTTP/2 setting sent by a
   server to allow the client to use Extended CONNECT.

   The semantics of the pseudo-header fields and setting are identical
   to those in HTTP/2 as defined in [RFC8441].  Appendix A.3 of [HTTP/3]
   requires that HTTP/3 settings be registered separately for HTTP/3.
   The SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL value is 0x08 (decimal 8), as in
   HTTP/2.

   If a server advertises support for Extended CONNECT but receives an
   Extended CONNECT request with a ":protocol" value that is unknown or
   is not supported, the server SHOULD respond to the request with a 501
   (Not Implemented) status code (Section 15.6.2 of [HTTP]).  A server
   MAY provide more information via a "problem details" response
   [RFC7807].

   The HTTP/3 stream closure is also analogous to the TCP connection
   closure of [RFC6455].  Orderly TCP-level closures are represented as
   a FIN bit on the stream (Section 4.4 of [HTTP/3]).  RST exceptions
   are represented with a stream error (Section 8 of [HTTP/3]) of type
   H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED (Section 8.1 of [HTTP/3]).

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC8441].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new setting in the "HTTP/3 Settings"
   registry (Section 11.2.2 of [HTTP/3]).
