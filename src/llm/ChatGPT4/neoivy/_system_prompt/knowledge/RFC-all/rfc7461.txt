1.  Introduction

   The Energy Management (EMAN) standards provide a specification for
   Energy Management.  This document defines a subset of a Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols for
   Energy monitoring of network devices and devices attached to the
   network and possibly extending to devices in the industrial
   automation setting with a network interface.

   The focus of the MIB module specified in this document is on the
   identification of Energy Objects and reporting the context and
   relationships of Energy Objects as defined in [RFC7326].  The module
   addresses Energy Object identification, Energy Object context, and
   Energy Object relationships.

1.1.  Energy Management Document Overview

   This document specifies the Energy Object Context (ENERGY-OBJECT-
   CONTEXT-MIB) and IANA Energy Relationship (IANA-ENERGY-RELATION-MIB)
   modules.  The Energy Object Context MIB module specifies MIB objects
   for identification of Energy Objects, and reporting context and
   relationship of an Energy Object.  The IANA Energy Relationship MIB
   module specifies the first version of the IANA-maintained definitions
   of relationships between Energy Objects.

RFC 7461                Energy Object Context MIB             March 2015


   Firstly, to illustrate the importance of energy monitoring in
   networks and, secondly, to list some of the important areas to be
   addressed by the Energy Management Framework [RFC7326], several use
   cases and network scenarios are presented in the EMAN applicability
   statement document [EMAN-AS].  In addition, for each scenario, the
   target devices for energy management, and how those devices powered
   and metered are also presented.  To address the network scenarios,
   requirements for power and energy monitoring for networking devices
   are specified in [RFC6988].  Based on the requirements in [RFC6988],
   [RFC7326] presents a solution approach.

   Accordingly, the scope of the MIB modules in this document is in
   accordance to the requirements specified in [RFC6988] and the
   concepts from [RFC7326].

   This document is based on the Energy Management Framework [RFC7326]
   and meets the requirements on identification of Energy Objects and
   their context and relationships as specified in the Energy Management
   requirements document [RFC6988].

   A second MIB module meeting the EMAN requirements [RFC6988] the
   Monitoring and Control MIB for Power and Energy [RFC7460], monitors
   the Energy Objects for Power States, for the Power and Energy
   consumption.  Power State monitoring includes: retrieving Power
   States, Power State properties, current Power State, Power State
   transitions, and Power State statistics.  In addition, this MIB
   module provides the Power Characteristics properties of the Power and
   Energy, along with optional characteristics.

   The applicability statement document [EMAN-AS] provides the list of
   use cases, describes the common aspects between existing Energy
   standards and the EMAN standard, and shows how the EMAN framework
   relates to other frameworks.

1.2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

RFC 7461                Energy Object Context MIB             March 2015


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB
   modules that are compliant with SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

RFC 7461                Energy Object Context MIB             March 2015


   The Energy Object Context (ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB) MIB module in
   this document specifies MIB objects for the identification of Energy
   Objects and reporting context and relationship of an Energy Object.
   The managed objects are contained in two tables: eoTable and
   eoRelationTable.

   The first table, eoTable, focuses on the link to the other MIB
   modules, on identification, and on the context of the Energy Object.
   The second table, eoRelationTable, specifies the relationships
   between Energy Objects.  This is a simplified representation of the
   relationship between Energy Objects.

   A "smidump-style" tree presentation of the MIB modules contained in
   the document is presented.  The meaning of the three symbols in is a
   compressed representation of the object's MAX-ACCESS clause, which
   may have the following values:

       "not-accessible"->"---"
       "accessible-for-notify"->"--n"
       "read-only"->"r-n"
       "read-write"->"rwn"

   relationship of the MIB objects in the eoTable, eoRelationTable, and
   ENTITY-MIB.  The MIB objects describe the identity, context, and
   relationship of an Energy Object.  The UML diagram, furthermore,
   contains objects from the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].

   As displayed in Figure 1, the MIB objects can be classified in
   different logical grouping of MIB objects.

   1) The Energy Object Identification.  See Section 5.1 "Energy Object
      Identification".  Devices and their sub-components are
      characterized by the power-related attributes of a physical entity
      present in the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].

   2) The Context Information.  See Section 4.1 "Energy Object Context".

   3) The links to other MIB modules.  See Section 4.3 "Links to Other
      Identifiers".

   4) The Energy Object Relationships specific information.  See Section
      4.4 "Energy Object Relationships".

   5) The Energy Object Identity Persistence.  See Section 4.5 "Energy
      Object Identity Persistence".

4.1.  Energy Object Identification

   Refer to the "Identification" section in [RFC7326] for background
   information about Energy Objects.

   Every Energy Object MUST implement the unique index,
   entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName, entPhysicalClass, and
   entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].  Module Compliance
   with respect to entity4CRCompliance of ENTITY-MIB MUST be supported,
   which requires a limited number of objects supported
   (entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalName, entPhysicalClass, and
   entPhysicalUUID).  entPhysicalIndex is used as index for the Energy
   Object in the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module.  Every Energy Object
   MUST have a printable name assigned to it.  Energy Objects MUST
   implement the entPhysicalName object specified in the ENTITY-MIB
   [RFC6933], which must contain the Energy Object name.

   For the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB compliance, every Energy Object
   instance MUST implement the entPhysicalUUID from the ENTITY-MIB
   [RFC6933].

   As displayed in [RFC4122], the following is an example of the string
   representation of a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) as a URN:
   urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6.

   For example, to understand the relationship between Energy Object
   Components and Energy Objects, the ENTITY-MIB physical containment
   tree [RFC6933] MUST be implemented.

RFC 7461                Energy Object Context MIB             March 2015


   A second example deals with one of the ENTITY-MIB extensions: if the
   Energy Object temperature is required, the managed objects from the
   ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB [RFC3433] should be supported.

   Each Energy Object MUST belong to a single Energy Management Domain
   or in other words, an Energy Object cannot belong to more than one
   Energy Management Domain.  Refer to the "Context: Domain" section in
   [RFC7326] for background information.  The eoDomainName, which is an
   element of the eoTable, is a read-write MIB object.  The Energy
   Management Domain should map 1:1 with a metered or sub-metered
   portion of the network.  The Energy Management Domain MUST be
   configured on the Energy Object.  The Energy Object MAY inherit some
   of the domain parameters (possibly domain name, some of the context
   information such as role or keywords, importance) from the Energy
   Object or the Energy Management Domain MAY be configured directly in
   an Energy Object.

   When an Energy Object acts as a Power Aggregator, the Energy Objects
   for which Power should be aggregated MUST be members of the same
   Energy Management Domain, specified by the eoDomainName MIB Object.

4.2.  Energy Object Context

   Refer to the "Context: Domain" section in [RFC7326] for background
   information.

   An Energy Object must provide a value for eoImportance in the range
   of 1-100 to help differentiate the use or relative value of the
   device.  The importance range is from 1 (least important) to 100
   (most important).  The default importance value is 1.

   An Energy Object can provide a set of eoKeywords.  These keywords are
   a list of tags that can be used for grouping and summary reporting
   within or between Energy Management Domains.

   An Energy Object can have Power Interfaces and those interfaces can
   be classified as Power Inlet, Power Outlet, or both.

   An Energy Object can be classified based on the physical properties
   of the Energy Object.  That Energy Object can be classified as
   consuming power or supplying power to other devices or that Energy
   Object can perform both of those functions and finally, an Energy
   Object can be a passive meter.

   Additionally, an Energy Object can provide an eoRoleDescription
   string that indicates the purpose the Energy Object serves in the
   network.

RFC 7461                Energy Object Context MIB             March 2015


4.3.   Links to Other Identifiers

   While the entPhysicalIndex is the primary index for all MIB objects
   in the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module, the Energy Management
   Systems (EnMS) must be able to make the link with the identifier(s)
   in other supported MIB modules.

   If the Energy Object is a Power over Ethernet (PoE) port, and if the
   Power over Ethernet MIB [RFC3621] is supported by the SNMP agent
   managing the Energy Object, then the Energy Objects eoethPortIndex
   and eoethPortGrpIndex MUST contain the corresponding values of
   pethPsePortIndex and pethPsePortGroupIndex [RFC3621].

   If the LLDP-MED MIB [LLDP-MIB] is supported by the Energy Object SNMP
   agent, then the Energy Object eoLldpPortNumber MUST contain the
   corresponding lldpLocPortNum from the LLDP MIB.

   The intent behind the links to the other MIB module identifier(s) is
   to correlate the instances in the different MIB modules.  This will
   allow the ENERGY-OBJECT-CONTEXT-MIB module to reference other MIB
   modules in cases where the Power over Ethernet and the LLDP MIB
   modules are supported by the SNMP agent.  Some use cases may not
   implement either of these two MIB modules for the Energy Objects.
   However, in situations where either of these two MIB modules are
   implemented, the EnMS must be able to correlate the instances in the
   different MIB modules.

   The eoAlternateKey object specifies an alternate key string that can
   be used to identify the Energy Object.  Since an EnMS may need to
   correlate objects across management systems, this alternate key is
   provided to facilitate such a link.  This optional value is intended
   as a foreign key or alternate identifier for a manufacturer or EnMS
   to use to correlate the unique Energy Object Id in other systems or
   namespaces.  If an alternate key is not available or is not
   applicable, then the value is the zero-length string.

   An Energy Object can have additional MIB objects that can be used for
   easier identification by the EnMS.  The optional objects
   eoMgmtMacAddress, eoMgmtAddressType, and eoMgmtDNSName can be used to
   help identify the relationship between the Energy Objects and other
   NMS objects.  These objects can be used as an alternate key to help
   link the Energy Object with other keyed information that may be
   stored within the EnMS(s).  For the optional objects that may not be
   included in some vendor implementations, the expected behavior when
   those objects are polled is a response noSuchInstance.

RFC 7461                Energy Object Context MIB             March 2015


4.4.   Energy Object Relationships

   Refer to the "Relationships" section in [RFC7326] for the definition
   and background information.  In order to link two Energy Objects, a
   separate table (eoRelationTable) has been introduced in this MIB
   module.

   Each Energy Object can have one or more Energy Object relationships
   with other Energy Objects.  The relationship between Energy Objects
   is specified in eoRelationTable.  The relationship between the Energy
   Objects is specified with the entPhysicalIndex of the Energy Object
   and the UUID of the remote Energy Object.  The UUID MUST comply to
   the RFC 4122 specifications.  It is important to note that it is
   possible that an Energy Object may not have an Energy Object
   relationship with other Energy Objects.

   The following relationships between Energy Objects have been
   considered in the eoRelationTable.

               Metering Relationship     -> meteredBy / metering

               Power Source Relationship -> poweredBy / powering

               Aggregation Relationship  -> aggregatedBy / aggregating

   Energy Object B has a "meteredBy" relationship with Energy Object A,
   if the energy consumption of Energy Object B is measured by Energy
   Object A.  Equivalently, it is possible to indicate that Energy
   Object A has a "metering" relationship with Energy Object B.

   Energy Object B has a "poweredBy" relationship with Energy Object A,
   if the power source of Energy Object B is Energy Object A.
   Equivalently, it is possible to indicate that Energy Object A has a
   "powering" relationship with Energy Object B.

   Energy Object B has "aggregatedBy" relationship with Energy Object A,
   if Energy Object A is an aggregation point for energy usage of Energy
   Object B.  Equivalently, it is possible to indicate that Energy
   Object A has "aggregating" relationship with Energy Object B.

   The IANA-ENERGY-RELATION-MIB module in Section 5 below specifies the
   first version of the IANA-maintained definitions of relationships.
   This way, for Energy Relationships, new textual conventions can be
   specified, without updating the primary Energy Object Context MIB
   module.

4.5.   Energy Object Identity Persistence

   In some situations, the Energy Object identity information should be
   persistent even after a device reload.  For example, in a static
   setup where a switch monitors a series of connected PoE phones, there
   is a clear benefit for the EnMS if the Energy Object Identification
   and all associated information persist, as it saves a network
   discovery.  However, in other situations, such as a wireless access
   point monitoring the mobile user PCs, there is not much advantage to
   persist the Energy Object Information.  The identity information of
   an Energy Object should be persisted and there is value in the
   writable MIB objects persisted.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      Unauthorized changes to the eoDomainName, entPhysicalName,
      eoRoleDescription, eoKeywords, eoImportance, eoAlternateKey,
      eoRelationID, eoRelationship, eoRelationStatus, and/or
      eoRelationStorageType MAY disrupt power and energy collection, and
      therefore any predefined policies defined in the network.





Parello, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 27]

RFC 7461                Energy Object Context MIB             March 2015


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   In certain situations, energy and power monitoring can reveal
   sensitive information about individuals' activities and habits.
   Implementors of this specification should use appropriate privacy
   protections as discussed in Section 9 of RFC 6988 and monitoring of
   individuals and homes should only occur with proper authorization.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned

   This document defines the first version of the IANA-maintained IANA-
   ENERGY-RELATION-MIB module, which allows new definitions of
   relationships between Energy Objects.

   A Specification Required as defined in [RFC5226] is REQUIRED for each
   modification of the energy relationships.

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry.
