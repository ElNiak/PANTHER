Signature Authentication in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)

Abstract

   The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited
   support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).
   The current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve
   groups, and there is a fixed hash algorithm tied to each group.  This
   document generalizes IKEv2 signature support to allow any signature
   method supported by PKIX and also adds signature hash algorithm
   negotiation.  This is a generic mechanism and is not limited to
   ECDSA; it can also be used with other signature algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   This document adds a new IKEv2 [RFC7296] authentication method to
   support signature methods in a more general way.  The current
   signature-based authentication methods in IKEv2 are per algorithm,
   i.e., there is one for RSA digital signatures, one for DSS digital
   signatures (using SHA-1), and three for different ECDSA curves, each
   tied to exactly one hash algorithm.  This design is cumbersome when
   more signature algorithms, hash algorithms, and elliptic curves need
   to be supported:






Kivinen & Snyder             Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 7427            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015


   o  In IKEv2, authentication using RSA digital signatures calls for
      padding based on RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, although the newer RSASSA-PSS
      padding method is now recommended.  (See Section 5 of "Additional
      Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use in PKIX
      Profile" [RFC4055].)

   o  With ECDSA and the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), there is no
      way to extract the hash algorithm from the signature.  Thus, for
      each new hash function to be supported with ECDSA or DSA, new
      authentication methods would be needed.  Support for new hash
      functions is particularly needed for DSS, because the current
      restriction to SHA-1 limits its security, meaning there is no
      point of using long keys with SHA-1.

   o  The tying of ECDSA authentication methods to particular elliptic
      curve groups requires definition of additional methods for each
      new group.  The combination of new ECDSA groups and hash functions
      will cause the number of required authentication methods to become
      unmanageable.  Furthermore, the restriction of ECDSA
      authentication to a specific group is inconsistent with the
      approach taken with DSS.

   With the selection of SHA-3, it might be possible that a signature
   method can be used with either SHA-3 or SHA-2.  This means that a new
   mechanism for negotiating the hash algorithm for a signature
   algorithm is needed.

   This document specifies two things:

   1.  A new authentication method that includes enough information
       inside the Authentication payload data so the signature hash
       algorithm can be extracted (see Section 3).

   2.  A method to indicate supported signature hash algorithms (see
       Section 4).  This allows the peer to know which hash algorithms
       are supported by the other end and use one of them (provided one
       is allowed by policy).  There is no requirement to actually
       negotiate one common hash algorithm, as different hash algorithms
       can be used in different directions if needed.

   The new digital signature method is flexible enough to include all
   current signature methods (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, RSASSA-PSS, etc.) and add
   new methods (ECGDSA, ElGamal, etc.) in the future.  To support this
   flexibility, the signature algorithm is specified in the same way
   that PKIX [RFC5280] specifies the signature of the Digital
   Certificate, by placing a simple ASN.1 object before the actual
   signature data.  This ASN.1 object contains an OID specifying the
   algorithm and associated parameters.  When an IKEv2 implementation



Kivinen & Snyder             Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 7427            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015


   supports a fixed set of signature methods with commonly used
   parameters, it is acceptable for the implementation to treat the
   ASN.1 object as a binary blob that can be compared against the fixed
   set of known values.  IKEv2 implementations can also parse the ASN.1
   and extract the signature algorithm and associated parameters.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Authentication Payload

   This document specifies a new "Digital Signature" authentication
   method.  This method can be used with any type of signature.  As the
   authentication methods are not negotiated in IKEv2, the peer is only
   allowed to use this authentication method if the Notify payload of
   type SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS has been sent and received by each
   peer.

   In this authentication method, the Authentication Data field inside
   the Authentication payload does not just include the signature value,
   as do other existing IKEv2 Authentication payloads.  Instead, the
   signature value is prefixed with an ASN.1 object indicating the
   algorithm used to generate the signature.  The ASN.1 object contains
   the algorithm identification OID, which identifies both the signature
   algorithm and the hash used when calculating the signature.  In
   addition to the OID, the ASN.1 object can contain optional parameters
   that might be needed for algorithms such as RSASSA-PSS (see
   Section 8.1 of [RFC3447]).

   To make implementations easier, the ASN.1 object is prefixed by the
   8-bit length field.  This length field allows simple implementations
   to know the length of the ASN.1 object without the need to parse it,
   so they can use it as a binary blob to be compared against known
   signature algorithm ASN.1 objects.  Thus, simple implementations may
   not need to be able to parse or generate ASN.1 objects.  See
   Appendix A for commonly used ASN.1 objects.

   The ASN.1 used here is the same ASN.1 used in the AlgorithmIdentifier
   of PKIX (see Section 4.1.1.2 of [RFC5280]), encoded using
   distinguished encoding rules (DER) [CCITT.X690.2002].  The algorithm
   OID inside the ASN.1 specifies the signature algorithm and the hash
   function, both of which are needed for signature verification.

   Currently, only the RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm uses the optional
   parameters.  For other signature algorithms, the parameters are



Kivinen & Snyder             Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 7427            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015


   either NULL or missing.  Note that for some algorithms there are two
   possible ASN.1 encodings, one with optional parameters included but
   set to NULL and the other where the optional parameters are omitted.
   These dual encodings exist because of the way those algorithms are
   specified.  When encoding the ASN.1, implementations SHOULD use the
   preferred format called for by the algorithm specification.  If the
   algorithm specification says "preferredPresent", then the parameters
   object needs to be present, although it will be NULL if no parameters
   are specified.  If the algorithm specification says
   "preferredAbsent", then the entire optional parameters object is
   missing.

   The Authentication payload is defined in IKEv2 as follows:

                           1                   2                   3

      *  ASN.1 Length (1 octet) - This field contains the length of the
         ASN.1-encoded AlgorithmIdentifier object.

      *  Algorithm Identifier (variable length) - This field contains
         the AlgorithmIdentifier ASN.1 object.

      *  Signature Value (variable length) - This field contains the
         actual signature value.

      There is no padding between the ASN.1 object and the signature
      value.  For hash truncation, the method specified in ANSI
      X9.62:2005 [X9.62] MUST be used.

4.  Hash Algorithm Notification

   The supported hash algorithms that can be used for the signature
   algorithms are indicated with a Notify payload of type
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS sent inside the IKE_SA_INIT exchange.

   This notification also implicitly indicates support of the new
   "Digital Signature" algorithm method, as well as the list of hash
   functions supported by the sending peer.

   Both ends send their list of supported hash algorithms.  When
   calculating the digital signature, a peer MUST pick one algorithm
   sent by the other peer.  Note that different algorithms can be used
   in different directions.  The algorithm OID indicating the selected
   hash algorithm (and signature algorithm) used when calculating the
   signature is sent inside the Authentication Data field of the
   Authentication payload (with Auth Method of "Digital Signature" as
   defined above).

   The Notify payload format is defined in Section 3.10 of [RFC7296].
   When a Notify payload of type SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS is sent, the
   Protocol ID field is set to 0, the SPI Size is set to 0, and the
   Notify Message Type is set to 16431.

   The Notification Data field contains the list of 16-bit hash
   algorithm identifiers from the Hash Algorithm Identifiers of IANA's
   "Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Parameters" registry.  There
   is no padding between the hash algorithm identifiers.

5.  Selecting the Public Key Algorithm

   This specification does not provide a way for the peers to indicate
   the public/private key pair types they have.  This raises the
   question of how the responder selects a public/private key pair type
   that the initiator supports.  This information can be found by
   several methods.

   One method to signal the key the initiator wants the responder to use
   is to indicate that in the IDr (Identification - Responder) payload
   of the IKE_AUTH request sent by the initiator.  In this case, the
   initiator indicates that it wants the responder to use a particular
   public/private key pair by sending an IDr payload that indicates that
   information.  In this case, the responder has different identities
   configured, with each of those identities associated to a public/
   private key or key type.

   Another method to ascertain the key the initiator wants the responder
   to use is through a Certificate Request payload sent by the
   initiator.  For example, the initiator could indicate in the



Kivinen & Snyder             Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 7427            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015


   Certificate Request payload that it trusts a certificate authority
   certificate signed by an ECDSA key.  This indication implies that the
   initiator can process ECDSA signatures, which means that the
   responder can safely use ECDSA keys when authenticating.

   A third method is for the responder to check the key type used by the
   initiator and use the same key type that the initiator used.  This
   method does not work if the initiator is using shared secret or
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication (i.e., is not
   using public keys).  If the initiator is using public key
   authentication, this method is the best way for the responder to
   ascertain the type of key the initiator supports.

   If the initiator uses a public key type that the responder does not
   support, the responder replies with a Notify message with error type
   AUTHENTICATION_FAILED.  If the initiator has multiple different keys,
   it may try a different key (and perhaps a different key type) until
   it finds a key that the other end accepts.  The initiator can also
   use the Certificate Request payload sent by the responder to help
   decide which public key should be tried.  In normal cases, when the
   initiator has multiple public keys, out-of-band configuration is used
   to select a public key for each connection.

6.  Security Considerations

   Tables 2 and 3 of the "Recommendations for Key Management"
   [NIST800-57] give recommendations for how to select suitable hash
   functions for the signature.

   This new digital signature method does not tie the Elliptic Curve to
   a specific hash function, which was done in the old IKEv2 ECDSA
   methods.  This means it is possible to mix different security levels.
   For example, it is possible to use a 512-bit Elliptic Curve with
   SHA1.  This means that the security of the authentication method is
   the security of the weakest component (signature algorithm, hash
   algorithm, or curve).  This complicates the security analysis of the
   system.

   IKEv2 peers have a series of policy databases (see Section 4.4 of
   [RFC4301]) that define which security algorithms and methods should
   be used during establishment of security associations.  To help end
   users select the desired security levels for communications protected

   Security downgrade attacks, where more secure methods are deleted or
   modified from a payload by a man-in-the-middle to force lower levels

RFC 7427            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015


   of security, are not a significant concern in IKEv2 Authentication
   payloads, as discussed in this RFC.  This is because a modified AUTH
   payload will be detected when the peer computes a signature over the
   IKE messages.

   One specific class of downgrade attacks requires selection of
   catastrophically weak ciphers.  In this type of attack, the man-in-
   the-middle attacker is able to "break" the cryptography in real time.
   This type of downgrade attack should be blocked by policy regarding
   cipher algorithm selection, as discussed above.

   The hash algorithm registry does not include MD5 as a supported hash
   algorithm, as it is not considered safe enough for signature use
   [WY05].

   The current IKEv2 protocol uses RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, which has known
   security vulnerabilities [KA08] [ME01] and does not allow using newer
   padding methods such as RSASSA-PSS.  The new method described in this
   RFC allows the use of other padding methods.

   The current IKEv2 protocol only allows use of normal DSA with SHA-1,
   which means the security of the authentication is limited to the
   security of SHA-1.  This new method allows using longer keys and
   longer hashes with DSA.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new IANA registry for IKEv2 Hash Algorithms.
   Changes and additions to this registry are by Expert Review
   [RFC5226].

   The initial values of this registry are:

   Hash Algorithm                       Value
   --------------                       -----
   RESERVED                             0
   SHA1                                 1
   SHA2-256                             2
   SHA2-384                             3
   SHA2-512                             4

   MD5 is not included in the hash algorithm list, as it is not
   considered safe enough for signature hash uses.

   Values 5-1023 are Unassigned.  Values 1024-65535 are reserved for
   Private Use among mutually consenting parties.

RFC 7427            Signature Authentication in IKEv2       January 2015


   This specification also adds a new value for
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS (16431) to the "IKEv2 Notify Message Types
   - Status Types" registry and adds a new value for Digital Signature
   (14) to the "IKEv2 Authentication Method" registry.

Appendix A.  Commonly Used ASN.1 Objects

   This section lists commonly used ASN.1 objects in binary form.  This
   section is not normative, and these values should only be used as
   examples.  If the ASN.1 object listed in Appendix A and the ASN.1
   object specified by the algorithm differ, then the algorithm
   specification must be used.  These values are taken from "New ASN.1
   Modules for the Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX)"
   [RFC5912].

A.1.  PKCS#1 1.5 RSA Encryption

   The algorithm identifiers here include several different ASN.1
   objects with different hash algorithms.  This document only includes
   the commonly used ones, i.e., the ones using SHA-1 or SHA-2 as the
   hash function.  Some other algorithms (such as MD2 and MD5) are not
   safe enough to be used as signature hash algorithms and are omitted.
   The IANA registry does not have code points for these other
   algorithms with RSA Encryption.  Note that there are no optional
   parameters in any of these algorithm identifiers, but all included
   here need NULL optional parameters present in the ASN.1.

   See "Algorithms and Identifiers for PKIX Profile" [RFC3279] and
   "Additional Algorithms and Identifiers for RSA Cryptography for use
   in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and

Appendix B.  IKEv2 Payload Example

B.1.  sha1WithRSAEncryption

   The IKEv2 AUTH payload would start like this:

   00000000: NN00 00LL 0e00 0000 0f30 0d06 092a 8648
   00000010: 86f7 0d01 0105 0500 ....

   Where the NN will be the next payload type (i.e., the value depends
   on the next payload after this Authentication payload), the LL will
   be the length of this payload, and after the sha1WithRSAEncryption
   ASN.1 block (15 bytes) there will be the actual signature, which is
   omitted here.
