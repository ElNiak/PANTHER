        Moving the Undeployed TCP Extensions RFC 1072, RFC 1106,
   RFC 1110, RFC 1145, RFC 1146, RFC 1379, RFC 1644, and RFC 1693 to
                            Historic Status

Abstract

   This document reclassifies several TCP extensions that have never
   seen widespread use to Historic status.  The affected RFCs are RFC
   1072, RFC 1106, RFC 1110, RFC 1145, RFC 1146, RFC 1379, RFC 1644, and
   RFC 1693.

1.  Introduction

   TCP has a long history, and several proposed TCP extensions have
   never seen widespread deployment.  Section 5 of the TCP "roadmap"
   document [RFC4614] already classifies a number of TCP extensions as
   Historic and describes the reasons for doing so, but it does not
   instruct the RFC Editor and IANA to change the status of these RFCs
   in the RFC database and the relevant IANA registries.  The sole
   purpose of this document is to do just that.  Please refer to Section
   5 of [RFC4614] for justification.

2.  RFC Editor Considerations

   Per this document, the RFC Editor has changed the status of the
   following RFCs to Historic [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC1072] on "TCP Extensions for Long-Delay Paths"

   o  [RFC1106] and [RFC1110] related to the "TCP Big Window and Nak
      Options"

   o  [RFC1145] and [RFC1146] related to the "TCP Alternate Checksum
      Options"

   o  [RFC1379] and [RFC1644] on "T/TCP -- Extensions for Transactions
      Functional Specification"

   o  [RFC1693] on "An Extension to TCP : Partial Order Service"

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has marked the TCP options 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15
   documented in [RFC1072], [RFC1146], [RFC1644], and [RFC1693] as
   "obsolete" in the "TCP Option Kind Numbers" registry [TCPOPTREG],
   with a reference to this RFC.

4.  Security Considerations

   As mentioned in [RFC4614], the TCP Extensions for Transactions
   (T/TCP) [RFC1379][RFC1644] are reported to have security issues
   [DEVIVO].
