Abstract

   This document specifies general rules for the interaction between the
   BIER Algorithm (BAR) and the IGP Algorithm (IPA) used for underlay
   path calculation within the Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER)
   architecture.  The semantics defined in this document update RFC 8401
   and RFC 8444.  This document also updates the "BIER Algorithm"
   registry established in RFC 8401.

1.  Introduction

   In the Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) architecture [RFC8279],
   packets with a BIER encapsulation header are forwarded to the
   neighbors on the underlay paths towards Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers
   (BFERs) that are represented by bits set in the BIER header's
   BitString.  The paths are calculated in the underlay topology for
   each sub-domain following a calculation algorithm specific to the
   sub-domain.  The topology or algorithm may or may not be congruent
   with unicast.  The algorithm could be a BIER-specific algorithm or
   could be a generic IGP one, e.g., Shortest Path First (SPF).

   In [RFC8401] and [RFC8444], an 8-bit BAR (BIER Algorithm) field and
   8-bit IPA (IGP Algorithm) field are defined to signal the BIER-
   specific algorithm and generic IGP Algorithm, respectively, and only
   value 0 is allowed for both fields in those two documents.

   This document specifies general rules for the interaction between the
   BIER Algorithm (BAR) and the IGP Algorithm (IPA) used for underlay
   path calculation when other BAR and/or IPA values are used.  The
   semantics defined in this document update [RFC8401] and [RFC8444].
   This document also updates the "BIER Algorithm" registry defined in
   [RFC8401] by renaming the "Experimental Use" range to "Private or
   Experimental Use".

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updated Definitions for IPA and BAR Fields

   The definitions for the IPA and BAR fields in Section 6.1 of
   [RFC8401] and Section 2.1 of [RFC8444] are updated as follows.

   IPA:  IGP Algorithm.  Specifies a generic Routing Algorithm and
      related Routing Constraints to calculate underlay paths to reach
      other Bit-Forwarding Routers (BFRs).  Values are from the "IGP
      Algorithm Types" registry.  One octet.

   BAR:  BIER Algorithm.  Specifies a BIER-specific Algorithm and BIER-
      specific Constraints used to either modify, enhance, or replace
      the calculation of underlay paths to reach other BFRs as defined
      by the IPA value.  Values are allocated from the "BIER Algorithm"
      registry.  One octet.

      When a BAR value is defined, the corresponding BIER-specific
      Algorithm (BA) and BIER-specific Constraint (BC) semantics SHOULD
      be specified.  For an IGP Algorithm to be used as a BIER IPA, its
      Routing Algorithm (RA) and Routing Constraint (RC) semantics
      SHOULD be specified.  If any of these semantics is not specified,
      it MUST be interpreted as the "NULL" algorithm or constraint.  For
      example, the IGP Algorithm 0 defined in [RFC8665] is treated as
      having a NULL RC, i.e., no constraints (see Section 3).

      If a specification is not available for a specific BAR value, its
      value MUST be from the Private or Experimental Use range of the
      registry.

3.  General Rules for the BAR and IPA Interaction

   For a particular sub-domain, all BFRs MUST be provisioned with and
   signal the same BAR and IPA values.  If a BFR discovers another BFR
   advertising a different BAR or IPA value for a sub-domain, it MUST
   treat the advertising router as incapable of supporting BIER for that
   sub-domain.  (One way of handling incapable routers is documented in
   Section 6.9 of [RFC8279], and additional methods may be defined in
   the future.)

   For a particular topology X that a sub-domain is associated with, a
   router MUST calculate the underlay paths according to its BAR and IPA
   values in the following way:

   1.  Apply the BIER constraints, resulting in BC(X).  If BC is NULL,
       then BC(X) is X itself.

   2.  Apply the routing constraints, resulting in RC(BC(X)).  If RC is
       NULL, then RC(BC(X)) is BC(X).

   3.  Select the algorithm AG as follows:

       a.  If BA is NULL, AG is set to RA.

       b.  If BA is not NULL, AG is set to BA.

   4.  Run AG on RC(BC(X)).

   It's possible that the resulting AG is not applicable to BIER.  In
   that case, no BIER paths will be calculated, and this is a network
   design issue that an operator needs to avoid when choosing the BAR or
   IPA.

3.1.  When BAR Is Not Used

   BAR value 0 is defined as "No BIER-specific algorithm is used"
   [RFC8401].  This value indicates NULL BA and BC.  Following the rules
   defined above, the IPA value alone identifies the calculation
   algorithm and constraints to be used for a particular sub-domain.

3.2.  Exceptions or Extensions to the General Rules

   Exceptions or extensions to the above general rules may be specified
   in the future for specific BAR and/or IPA values.  When that happens,
   compatibility with defined BAR and/or IPA values and semantics need
   to be specified.

4.  Examples

   As an example, one may define a new BAR with a BIER-specific
   constraint of "excluding BIER-incapable routers".  No BIER-specific
   algorithm is specified, and the BIER-specific constraint can go with
   any IPA, i.e., any RC defined by the IPA is augmented with "excluding
   BIER-incapable routers".  (Routers that do not support BIER are not
   considered when applying the IGP Algorithm.)

   If the BC and RC happen to conflict and lead to an empty topology,
   then no BIER forwarding path will be found.  For example, the BC
   could be "exclude BIER-incapable routers", and the RC could be
   "include green links only".  If all the green links are associated
   with BIER-incapable routers, it results in an empty topology.  This
   is a network design issue that an operator needs to avoid when
   choosing the BAR or IPA.

   In another example, a BAR value can be specified to use the Steiner
   tree algorithm and used together with IPA 0 (which uses an SPF
   algorithm).  According to the general rules, the BIER-specific
   algorithm takes precedence so SPF is not used.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The "BIER Algorithm" registry has been updated as follows:

   1.  The "Experimental Use" range has been renamed "Private or
       Experimental Use".

   2.  This document has been added as a reference both for the registry
       itself and for values 240-254 in the registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies general rules for the interaction between the
   BIER Algorithm (BAR) and the IGP Algorithm (IPA) used for underlay
   path calculation.  It does not change the security aspects as
   discussed in [RFC8279], [RFC8401], and [RFC8444].
