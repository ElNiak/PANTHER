        Reclassification of Suite B Documents to Historic Status

Abstract

   This document reclassifies the RFCs related to the United States
   National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B cryptographic algorithms as
   Historic, and it discusses the reasons for doing so.  This document
   moves seven Informational RFCs to Historic status: RFCs 5759, 6239,
   6318, 6379, 6380, 6403, and 6460.  In addition, it moves three
   obsolete Informational RFCs to Historic status: RFCs 4869, 5008, and
   5430.

1.  Introduction

   Several RFCs profile security protocols for use with the National
   Security Agency (NSA) Suite B Cryptography.  Suite B is no longer
   supported by NSA, and the web pages that specify the cryptographic
   algorithms are no longer available.

   In July 2015, NSA published the Committee for National Security
   Systems Advisory Memorandum 02-15 as the first step in replacing
   Suite B with NSA's Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA)
   Suite.  Information about the CNSA Suite can be found in [CNSA].

RFC 8423                   Suite B to Historic                 July 2018


2.  Rationale

   As indicated in [CNSA], NSA is transitioning from Suite B to the CNSA
   Suite.  As a result, the profiles of the security protocols for the
   Suite B algorithms are now only of historic interest.

3.  The RFCs Related to Suite B

   Between 2007 and 2012, several Suite-B-related RFCs were published to
   profile security protocols for use with the Suite B algorithms.  They
   are:

   o  [RFC4869], "Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec" (Obsoleted by
      RFC 6379)

   o  [RFC5008], "Suite B in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
      Extensions (S/MIME)" (Obsoleted by RFC 6318)

   o  [RFC5430], "Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"
      (Obsoleted by RFC 6460)

   o  [RFC5759], "Suite B Certificate and Certificate Revocation List
      (CRL) Profile"

   o  [RFC6239], "Suite B Cryptographic Suites for Secure Shell (SSH)"

   o  [RFC6318], "Suite B in Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail
      Extensions (S/MIME)"

   o  [RFC6379], "Suite B Cryptographic Suites for IPsec"

   o  [RFC6380], "Suite B Profile for Internet Protocol Security
      (IPsec)"

   o  [RFC6403], "Suite B Profile of Certificate Management over CMS"

   o  [RFC6460], "Suite B Profile for Transport Layer Security (TLS)"

4.  Documents That Reference the Suite-B-Related RFCs

   These RFCs reference each other several times.  These cross-
   references are not examined further in this document.

   Other RFCs make reference to these Suite-B-related RFCs; these
   references are discussed in the following subsections.

4.1.  Documents That Reference RFC 4869

   One other RFC makes reference to RFC 4869 [RFC4869].

   RFC 6071, "IP Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
   Document Roadmap" [RFC6071], points out that RFC 4869 adds four pre-
   defined suites based upon Suite B specifications.  They are:

   o  IKE/ESP suite "Suite-B-GCM-128"

   o  IKE/ESP suite "Suite-B-GCM-256"

   o  IKE/AH suite "Suite-B-GMAC-128"

   o  IKE/AH suite "Suite-B-GMAC-256"

   In each case, these suite definitions make use of algorithms that are
   defined in other RFCs.  No interoperability or security concerns are
   raised if implementations continue to make use of these suite names.

4.2.  Documents That Reference RFC 5759

   One other RFC makes reference to RFC 5759 [RFC5759].

   RFC 6187, "X.509v3 Certificates for Secure Shell Authentication"
   [RFC6187], points out that RFC 5759 provides additional guidance for
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) keys when used
   with Suite B.

4.3.  Documents That Reference RFC 6379

   One other RFC makes reference to RFC 6379 [RFC6379].

   RFC 7321, "Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements and
   Usage Guidance for Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) and
   Authentication Header (AH)" [RFC7321], points out that the AES-GCM
   algorithm is used by Suite B, and it has emerged as the preferred
   authenticated encryption method in IPsec.  RFC 7321 has since been
   obsoleted by RFC 8221.

4.4.  Documents That Reference RFC 6403

   Two other RFCs make reference to RFC 6403 [RFC6403].

   RFC 6402, "Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) Updates" [RFC6402],
   says that development of the profile for Suite B was the activity
   that demonstrated the need for these updates.

RFC 8423                   Suite B to Historic                 July 2018


   RFC 7030, "Enrollment over Secure Transport" [RFC7030], points out
   that the scenarios in Appendix of RFC 6403 are very similar to three
   of the scenarios described.

4.5.  Documents That Reference RFC 6460

   Three other RFCs make reference to RFC 6460 [RFC6460].

   RFC 6605, "Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for
   DNSSEC" [RFC6605], states that material was copied liberally from RFC
   6460.  The Standards Track status of RFC 6605 is not affected by RFC
   6460 moving to Historic status.

   RFC 7525, "Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)" [RFC7525],
   observes that the Suite B profile of TLS 1.2 uses different
   ciphersuites.

   RFC 8253, "PCEPS: Usage of TLS to Provide a Secure Transport for the
   Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)" [RFC8253],
   points to RFC 6460 for the TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
   and TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 ciphersuites.  Both of
   these ciphersuites are defined in [RFC5289], which would have been a
   better reference.  The Standards Track status of RFC 8253 is not
   affected by RFC 6460 moving to Historic status.

5.  Impact of Reclassifying the Suite-B-Related RFCs to Historic

   No interoperability or security concerns are raised by reclassifying
   the Suite-B-related RFCs to Historic status.  As described in
   Section 4, none of the RFCs being moved to Historic status is the
   sole specification of a cryptographic algorithm or an identifier for
   a cryptographic algorithm.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   No interoperability or security concerns are raised by reclassifying
   the Suite-B-related RFCs to Historic status.

   NSA is transitioning away from some of the cryptographic algorithms
   and key sizes that were employed in the Suite B profiles.
