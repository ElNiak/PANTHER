Abstract

   This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in
   currently deployed IETF Transport Area documented standards.  In
   order to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all
   IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken.  One of these steps
   is the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.
   It is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be
   redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will
   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards
   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be
   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.

1.0.  Introduction

   This document is part of a document set aiming to document all usage
   of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort to have the
   information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents
   conforming to the current IETF areas (Application,  Internet,
   Operations & Management, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).

   For a full introduction, please see the introduction [1].

2.0.  Document Organization

   The rest of the document sections are described below.

   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full,
   Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is
   discussed in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around)
   RFC 3100. The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.  That is,
   each RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do
   not "look ahead" to see if the problems have already been fixed.

   Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,
   and 6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole
   and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are
   correlated.

3.0.  Full Standards

   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as
   "Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely
   implemented and used throughout the Internet.

3.1.  RFC 768 User Datagram Protocol

   Although UDP is a transport protocol there is one reference to the
   UDP/IP interface that states;  "The UDP module must be able to
   determine the source and destination internet addresses and the
   protocol field from the internet header."  This does not force a
   rewrite of the protocol but will clearly cause changes in
   implementations.

3.2.  RFC 793 Transmission Control Protocol

   Section 3.1 which specifies the header format for TCP.  The TCP
   header is free from IPv4 references but there is an inconsistency in
   the computation of checksums.  The text says:  "The checksum also
   covers a 96 bit pseudo header conceptually prefixed to the TCP
   header.  This pseudo header contains the Source Address, the
   Destination Address, the Protocol, and TCP length."  The first and
   second 32-bit words are clearly meant to specify 32-bit IPv4
   addresses.  While no modification of the TCP protocol is necessitated
   by this problem, an alternate needs to be specified as an update
   document, or as part of another IPv6 document.

3.3.  RFC 907 Host Access Protocol specification

   This is a layer 3 protocol, and has as such no IPv4 dependencies.

3.4.  NetBIOS Service Protocols.  RFC1001, RFC1002

   3.4.1.   RFC 1001 PROTOCOL STANDARD FOR A NetBIOS SERVICE ON A
            TCP/UDP TRANSPORT: CONCEPTS AND METHODS

      Section 15.4.1.  RELEASE BY B NODES defines:

         A NAME RELEASE DEMAND contains the following information:

           -  NetBIOS name
           -  The scope of the NetBIOS name
           -  Name type: unique or group
           -  IP address of the releasing node
           -  Transaction ID

      Section 15.4.2.  RELEASE BY P NODES defines:

         A NAME RELEASE REQUEST contains the following information:

           -  NetBIOS name
           -  The scope of the NetBIOS name
           -  Name type: unique or group
           -  IP address of the releasing node
           -  Transaction ID

RFC 3794       IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Transport Area       June 2004


         A NAME RELEASE RESPONSE contains the following information:

           -  NetBIOS name
           -  The scope of the NetBIOS name
           -  Name type: unique or group
           -  IP address of the releasing node
           -  Transaction ID
           -  Result:
                -  Yes: name was released
                -  No: name was not released, a reason code is provided

      Section 16.  NetBIOS SESSION SERVICE states:

         The NetBIOS session service begins after one or more IP
         addresses have been found for the target name.  These addresses
         may have been acquired using the NetBIOS name query
         transactions or by other means, such as a local name table or
         cache.

      Section 16.1.  OVERVIEW OF NetBIOS SESSION SERVICE

         Session service has three phases:

         Session establishment - it is during this phase that the IP
            address and TCP port of the called name is determined, and a
            TCP connection is established with the remote party.

      6.1.1.  SESSION ESTABLISHMENT PHASE OVERVIEW

         An end-node begins establishment of a session to another node
         by somehow acquiring (perhaps using the name query transactions
         or a local cache) the IP address of the node or nodes purported
         to own the destination name.

         Once the TCP connection is open, the calling node sends session
         service request packet.  This packet contains the following
         information:

           -  Calling IP address (see note)
           -  Calling NetBIOS name
           -  Called IP address (see note)
           -  Called NetBIOS name

         NOTE: The IP addresses are obtained from the TCP service
               interface.

RFC 3794       IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Transport Area       June 2004


         If a compatible LISTEN exists, and there are adequate
         resources, then the session server may transform the existing
         TCP connection into the NetBIOS data session.  Alternatively,
         the session server may redirect, or "retarget" the caller to
         another TCP port (and IP address).

         If the caller is redirected, the caller begins the session
         establishment anew, but using the new IP address and TCP port
         given in the retarget response.  Again a TCP connection is
         created, and again the calling and called node exchange
         credentials.  The called party may accept the call, reject the
         call, or make a further redirection.

      17.1.  OVERVIEW OF NetBIOS DATAGRAM SERVICE

         Every NetBIOS datagram has a named destination and source.  To
         transmit a NetBIOS datagram, the datagram service must perform
         a name query operation to learn the IP address and the
         attributes of the destination NetBIOS name.  (This information
         may be cached to avoid the overhead of name query on subsequent
         NetBIOS datagrams.)

      17.1.1.  UNICAST, MULTICAST, AND BROADCAST

         NetBIOS datagrams may be unicast, multicast, or broadcast.  A
         NetBIOS datagram addressed to a unique NetBIOS name is unicast.
         A NetBIOS datagram addressed to a group NetBIOS name, whether
         there are zero, one, or more actual members, is multicast.  A
         NetBIOS datagram sent using the NetBIOS "Send Broadcast
         Datagram" primitive is broadcast.

      17.1.2.  FRAGMENTATION OF NetBIOS DATAGRAMS

         When the header and data of a NetBIOS datagram exceeds the
         maximum amount of data allowed in a UDP packet, the NetBIOS
         datagram must be fragmented before transmission and reassembled
         upon receipt.

         A NetBIOS Datagram is composed of the following protocol
         elements:

           -  IP header of 20 bytes (minimum)
           -  UDP header of 8 bytes
           -  NetBIOS Datagram Header of 14 bytes
           -  The NetBIOS Datagram data.

      18.  NODE CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

         -  B NODES:
              -  Node's permanent unique name
              -  Whether IGMP is in use
              -  Broadcast IP address to use
              -  Whether NetBIOS session keep-alives are needed
              -  Usable UDP data field length (to control fragmentation)
         -  P NODES:
              -  Node's permanent unique name
              -  IP address of NBNS
              -  IP address of NBDD
              -  Whether NetBIOS session keep-alives are needed
              -  Usable UDP data field length (to control fragmentation)
         -  M NODES:
              -  Node's permanent unique name
              -  Whether IGMP is in use
              -  Broadcast IP address to use
              -  IP address of NBNS
              -  IP address of NBDD
              -  Whether NetBIOS session keep-alives are needed
              -  Usable UDP data field length (to control fragmentation)

   All of the proceeding sections make implicit use of IPv4 addresses
   and a new specification should be defined for use of IPv6 underlying
   addresses.

      5.3.  NetBIOS DATAGRAM SERVICE PROTOCOLS

         The following are GLOBAL variables and should be NetBIOS user
         configurable:

         -  BROADCAST_ADDRESS: the IP address B-nodes use to send
            datagrams with group name destinations and broadcast
            datagrams.  The default is the IP broadcast address for a
            single IP network.

RFC 3794       IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Transport Area       June 2004


      There is also a large amount of pseudo code for most of the
      protocols functionality that make no specific reference to IPv4
      addresses. However they assume the use of the above defined
      packets.  The pseudo code may be valid for IPv6 as long as the
      packet formats are updated.

3.5.  RFC 1006 ISO Transport Service on top of the TCP (Version: 3)

      Section 5.  The Protocol defines a mapping specification

         Mapping parameters is also straight-forward:

            network service             TCP
                    -------             ---

4.0.  Draft Standards

   Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple,
   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are
   usually quite mature and widely used.

   4.1.  RFC 3530 Network File System (NFS) version 4 Protocol

      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

   4.2.  RFC 3550 RTP: A Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications

5.0.  Proposed Standards

   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no
   requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases
   Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards
   process.  They therefore are often just proposed ideas that are
   presented to the Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or
   they are one of many competing solutions to problems.  In these later
   cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose
   of this discussion.

   5.01.  RFC 1144 Compressing TCP/IP headers for low-speed serial
          links

      This RFC is specifically oriented towards TCP/IPv4 packet headers
      and will not work in it's current form.  Significant work has
      already been done on similar algorithms for TCP/IPv6 headers.

   5.02.  RFC 1323 TCP Extensions for High Performance

      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

   5.03.  RFC 1553 Compressing IPX Headers Over WAN Media (CIPX)

      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

   5.04.  RFC 1692 Transport Multiplexing Protocol (TMux)

      Section 6.  Implementation Notes is states:

         Because the TMux mini-header does not contain a TOS field, only
         segments with the same IP TOS field should be contained in a
         single TMux message.  As most systems do not use the TOS
         feature, this is not a major restriction.  Where the TOS field
         is used, it may be desirable to hold several messages under
         construction for a host, one for each TOS value.

         Segments containing IP options should not be multiplexed.

      This is clearly IPv4 specific, but a simple restatement in IPv6
      terms will allow complete functionality.

   5.05.  RFC 1831 RPC: Remote Procedure Call Protocol
          Specification Version 2 RPC

      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

   5.06.  RFC 1833 Binding Protocols for ONC RPC Version 2

      In Section 2.1 RPCBIND Protocol Specification (in RPC Language)
      there is the following code fragment:

       * Protocol family (r_nc_protofmly):
       *   This identifies the family to which the protocol belongs.
       *   The following values are defined:
       *     NC_NOPROTOFMLY   "-"
       *     NC_LOOPBACK      "loopback"
       *     NC_INET          "inet"
       *     NC_IMPLINK       "implink"
       *     NC_PUP           "pup"
       *     NC_CHAOS         "chaos"
       *     NC_NS            "ns"
       *     NC_NBS           "nbs"
       *     NC_ECMA          "ecma"
       *     NC_DATAKIT       "datakit"
       *     NC_CCITT         "ccitt"
       *     NC_SNA           "sna"
       *     NC_DECNET        "decnet"
       *     NC_DLI           "dli"
       *     NC_LAT           "lat"
       *     NC_HYLINK        "hylink"
       *     NC_APPLETALK     "appletalk"
       *     NC_NIT           "nit"
       *     NC_IEEE802       "ieee802"
       *     NC_OSI           "osi"
       *     NC_X25           "x25"
       *     NC_OSINET        "osinet"
       *     NC_GOSIP         "gosip"

      It is clear that the value for NC_INET is intended for the IP
      protocol and is seems clear that it is IPv4 dependent.

   5.21.  RFC 2326 Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)

      Section 3.2 RTSP URL defines:

         The "rtsp" and "rtspu" schemes are used to refer to network
         resources via the RTSP protocol.  This section defines the
         scheme-specific syntax and semantics for RTSP URLs.

            rtsp_URL  =   ( "rtsp:" | "rtspu:" )
                          "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path ]
            host      =   <A legal Internet host domain name of IP

            port      =   *DIGIT

         Although later in that section the following text is added:

            The use of IP addresses in URLs SHOULD be avoided whenever
            possible (see RFC 1924 [19]).

      which implies the use of the "IP4" tag and it should be possible
      to use an "IP6" tag.  There are also numerous other similar
      examples using the "IP4" tag.

      RTSP is also dependent on IPv6 support in a protocol capable of
      describing media configurations, for example SDP RFC 2327.

      RTSP can be used over IPv6 as long as the media description
      protocol supports IPv6, but only for certain restricted use cases.
      For full functionality there is need for IPv6 support.  The amount
      of updates needed are small.

   5.22.  RFC 2327 SDP: Session Description Protocol (SDP)

      This specification is under revision, and IPv6 support was added

RFC 3794       IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Transport Area       June 2004


6.0.  Experimental RFCs

   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have
   widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often
   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented
   to the Internet community in order to allow potential
   interoperability or some other potential useful scenario.  In a few
   cases they are presented as alternatives to the mainstream solution
   to an acknowledged problem.

   6.1.  RFC 908 Reliable Data Protocol (RDP)

      This document is IPv4 limited as stated in the following section:

      4.1.  IP Header Format

         When used in the internet environment, RDP segments are sent
         using the version 4 IP header as described in RFC791, "Internet
         Protocol."  The RDP protocol number is ??? (decimal).  The
         time-to-live field should be set to a reasonable value for the
         network.

         All other fields should be set as specified in RFC-791.

      A new protocol specification would be needed to support IPv6.

   6.02.  RFC 938 Internet Reliable Transaction Protocol functional and
          interface specification (IRTP)

      This specification states:

      4.1.  State Variables

         Each IRTP is associated with a single internet address.  The
         synchronization mechanism of the IRTP depends on the
         requirement that each IRTP module knows the internet addresses
         of all modules with which it will communicate.  For each remote
         internet address, an IRTP module must maintain the following
         information (called the connection table):

         rem_addr     (32 bit remote internet address)

      A new specification that is IPv6 aware would need to be created.

RFC 3794       IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Transport Area       June 2004


   6.03.  RFC 998 NETBLT: A bulk data transfer protocol

      This RFC states:

         The active end specifies a passive client through a client-
         specific "well-known" 16 bit port number on which the passive
         end listens.  The active end identifies itself through a 32 bit
         Internet address and a unique 16 bit port number.

      Clearly, this is IPv4 dependent, but could easily be modified to
      support IPv6 addressing.

   6.04.  RFC 1045 VMTP: Versatile Message Transaction Protocol

      This specification has many IPv4 dependencies in its
      implementation appendices.  For operations over IPv6 a similar
      implementation procedure must be defined.  The IPv4 specific
      information is show below.

      IV.1.  Domain 1

         For initial use of VMTP, we define the domain with Domain
         identifier 1 as follows:

         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+
         | TypeFlags | Discriminator  |    Internet Address    |
         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+
            4 bits          28 bits                32 bits

         The Internet address is the Internet address of the host on
         which this entity-id is originally allocated.  The
         Discriminator is an arbitrary value that is unique relative to
         this Internet host address.  In addition, the host must
         guarantee that this identifier does not get reused for a long
         period of time after it becomes invalid.  ("Invalid" means that
         no VMTP module considers in bound to an entity.)  One technique
         is to use the lower order bits of a 1 second clock.  The clock
         need not represent real-time but must never be set back after a
         crash.  In a simple implementation, using the low order bits of
         a clock as the time stamp, the generation of unique identifiers
         is overall limited to no more than 1 per second on average.
         The type flags were described in Section 3.1.

         An entity may migrate between hosts.  Thus, an implementation
         can heuristically use the embedded Internet address to locate
         an entity but should be prepared to maintain a cache of
         redirects for migrated entities, plus accept Notify operations
         indicating that migration has occurred.

RFC 3794       IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Transport Area       June 2004


         Entity group identifiers in Domain 1 are structured in one of
         two forms, depending on whether they are well-known or
         dynamically allocated identifiers.  A well-known entity
         identifier is structured as:

         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+
         | TypeFlags |  Discriminator |Internet Host Group Addr|
         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+
            4 bits          28 bits                32 bits

         with the second high-order bit (GRP) set to 1.  This form of
         entity identifier is mapped to the Internet host group address
         specified in the low-order 32 bits.  The Discriminator
         distinguishes group identifiers using the same Internet host
         group.  Well-known entity group identifiers should be allocated
         to correspond to the basic services provided by hosts that are
         members of the group, not specifically because that service is
         provided by VMTP.  For example, the well-known entity group
         identifier for the domain name service should contain as its
         embedded Internet host group address the host group for Domain
         Name servers.

         A dynamically allocated entity identifier is structured as:

         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+
         | TypeFlags |  Discriminator |   Internet Host Addr   |
         +-----------+----------------+------------------------+
            4 bits          28 bits             32 bits

         with the second high-order bit (GRP) set to 1.  The Internet
         address in the low-order 32 bits is a Internet address assigned
         to the host that dynamically allocates this entity group
         identifier.  A dynamically allocated entity group identifier is
         mapped to Internet host group address 232.X.X.X where X.X.X are
         the low-order 24 bits of the Discriminator subfield of the
         entity group identifier.

         We use the following notation for Domain 1 entity identifiers
         <10> and propose it use as a standard convention.

         <flags>-<discriminator>-<Internet address>

RFC 3794       IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Transport Area       June 2004


      where <flags> are [X]{BE,LE,RG,UG}[A]

         X = reserved
         BE = big-endian entity
         LE = little-endian entity
         RG = restricted group
         UG = unrestricted group
         A  = alias

      and <discriminator> is a decimal integer and <Internet address> is
      in standard dotted decimal IP address notation.

      V.1.  Authentication Domain 1

         A principal identifier is structured as follows.

         +---------------------------+------------------------+
         |     Internet Address      | Local User Identifier  |
         +---------------------------+------------------------+
                     32 bits                    32 bits

      VI.  IP Implementation

         VMTP is designed to be implemented on the DoD IP Internet
         Datagram Protocol (although it may also be implemented as a
         local network protocol directly in "raw" network packets.)

         The well-known entity identifiers specified to date are:

      VMTP_MANAGER_GROUP   RG-1-224.0.1.0
                      Managers for VMTP operations.

      VMTP_DEFAULT_BECLIENT  BE-1-224.0.1.0
                      Client entity identifier to use when a (big-
                      endian) host has not determined or been allocated
                      any client entity identifiers.

      VMTP_DEFAULT_LECLIENT  LE-1-224.0.1.0
                      Client entity identifier to use when a (little-
                      endian) host has not determined or been allocated
                      any client entity identifiers.

      Note that 224.0.1.0 is the host group address assigned to VMTP and
      to which all VMTP hosts belong.

   6.05.  RFC 1146 TCP alternate checksum options

      There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

7.0.  Summary of Results

   In the initial survey of RFCs 24 positives were identified out of a
   total of 104, broken down as follows:

         Standards:                         3 out of  5 or 60.00%
         Draft Standards:                   0 out of  2 or  0.00%
         Proposed Standards:               17 out of 82 or 20.73%
         Experimental RFCs:                 4 out of 15 or 26.67%

   Of those identified many require no action because they document
   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols
   that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.
   Additionally there are many instances of standards that SHOULD be
   updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not
   updated.  The remaining instances are documented below.

7.1.  Standards

   7.1.1.  STD 7 Transmission Control Protocol (RFC 793)

      Section 3.1 defines the technique for computing the TCP checksum
      that uses the 32 bit source and destination IPv4 addresses.  This
      problem is addressed in RFC 2460 Section 8.1.

   7.1.2.  STD 19 Netbios over TCP/UDP (RFCs 1001 & 1002)

      These two RFCs have many inherent IPv4 assumptions and a new set
      of protocols must be defined.

   7.1.3.  STD 35 ISO Transport over TCP (RFC 1006)

      This problem has been fixed in RFC 2126, ISO Transport Service on
      top of TCP.

7.2.  Draft Standards

   There are no draft standards within the scope of this document.

7.3.  Proposed Standards

   7.3.01.  TCP/IP Header Compression over Slow Serial Links (RFC 1144)

      This problem has been resolved in RFC2508, Compressing IP/UDP/RTP
      Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links.  See also RFC 2507 & RFC 2509.

   7.3.02.  ONC RPC v2 (RFC 1833)

      The problems can be resolved with a definition of the NC_INET6
      protocol family.

   7.3.03.  RTSP (RFC 2326)

      Problem has been acknowledged by the RTSP developer group and will
      be addressed in the move from Proposed to Draft Standard.  This
      problem is also addressed in RFC 2732, IPv6 Literal Addresses in
      URL's.

   7.3.04.  SDP (RFC 2327)

      One problem is addressed in RFC 2732, IPv6 Literal Addresses in
      URL's.  The other problem can be addressed with a minor textual
      clarification.  This must be done if the document is to transition
      from Proposed to Draft.  These problems are solved by documents
      currently in Auth48 or IESG discuss.

   7.3.05.  IPPM Metrics (RFC 2678)

      The IPPM WG is working to resolve these issues.

   7.3.06.  IPPM One Way Delay Metric for IPPM (RFC 2679)

      The IPPM WG is working to resolve these issues.  An ID is
      available (draft-ietf-ippm-owdp-03.txt).

   7.3.07.  IPPM One Way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM (RFC 2680)

      The IPPM WG is working to resolve these issues.

   7.3.09.  Round Trip Delay Metric for IPPM (RFC 2681)

      The IPPM WG is working to resolve these issues.

   7.3.08.  The PINT Service Protocol: Extensions to SIP and SDP for IP
            Access to Telephone Call Services(RFC 2848)

      This specification is dependent on SDP which has IPv4
      dependencies.  Once these limitations are fixed, then this
      protocol should support IPv6.

   7.3.09.  TCP Processing of the IPv4 Precedence Field (RFC 2873)

      The problems are not being addressed.

      This document defines a protocol that discusses compressible
      flows, but only in an IPv4 context.  When IPv6 compressible flows
      are defined, a similar technique should also be defined.

   7.3.11.  SDP For ATM Bearer Connections  (RFC 3108)

      The problems are not being addressed, but it is unclear whether
      the specification is being used.

   7.3.12.  The Congestion Manager (RFC 3124)

      An update to this document can be simply define the use of the
      IPv6 Traffic Class field since it is defined to be exactly the
      same as the IPv4 TOS field.
