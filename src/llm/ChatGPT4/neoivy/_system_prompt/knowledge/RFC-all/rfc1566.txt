1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, this memo extends the basic Network Services
   Monitoring MIB [5] to allow monitoring of Message Transfer Agents
   (MTAs). It may also be used to monitor MTA components within
   gateways.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o  RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
         describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      o  STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
         objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o  RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
         architectural aspects of the framework.

      o  RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
         access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Message Flow Model

   A general model of message flow inside an MTA has to be presented
   before a MIB can be described. Generally speaking, message flow
   occurs in four steps:

   (1)  Messages are received by the MTA from User Agents, Message
        Stores, other MTAs, and gateways.

   (2)  The "next hop" for the each message is determined. This is
        simply the destination the message is to be transmitted to;
        it may or may not be the final destination of the message.
        Multiple "next hops" may exist for a single message (as a
        result of either having multiple recipients or distribution
        list expansion); this may make it necessary to duplicate
        messages.

   (3)  Messages are converted into the format that's appropriate
        for the next hop.

   (4)  Messages are transmitted to the appropriate destination,
        which may be a User Agent, Message Store, another MTA, or
        gateway.

   Storage of messages in the MTA occurs at some point during this
   process. However, it is important to note that storage may occur at
   different and possibly even multiple points during this process. For
   example, some MTAs expand messages into multiple copies as they are
   received. In this case (1), (2), and (3) may all occur prior to
   storage.  Other MTAs store messages precisely as they are received
   and perform all expansions and conversions during retransmission
   processing. So here only (1) occurs prior to storage.  This leads to
   situations where, in general, a measurement of messages received may
   not equal a measurement of messages in store, or a measurement of
   messages stored may not equal a measurement of messages
   retransmitted, or both.

4.  MTA Objects

   If there are one or more MTAs on the host, the following mta group
   may be used to monitor them. Any number of the MTAs on a host may be
   monitored. Each MTA is dealt with as a separate application and has
   its own applTable entry in the Network Services Monitoring MIB.

   The MIB described in this document covers only the portion which is
   specific to the monitoring of MTAs. The network service related part
   of the MIB is covered in a separate document [5].

   -- MTAs typically group inbound reception, queue storage, and
   -- outbound transmission in some way. In the most extreme case
   -- information will be maintained for each different entity that
   -- receives messages and for each entity the MTA stores messages for
   -- and delivers messages to.  Other MTAs may elect to treat all
   -- reception equally, all queue storage equally, all deliveries
   -- equally, or some combination of this.

   -- In any case, a grouping abstraction is an extremely useful for
   -- breaking down the activities of an MTA. For purposes of labelling
   -- this will be called a "group" in this MIB.

   -- Each group contains all the variables needed to monitor all aspects
   -- of an MTA's operation.  However, the fact that all groups contain
   -- all possible variables does not imply that all groups must use all
   -- possible variables. For example, a single group might be used to
   -- monitor only one kind of event (inbound processing, outbound
   -- processing, or storage). In this sort of configuration all unused
   -- counters would be inaccessible; e.g., returning either a
   -- noSuchName error (for an SNMPv1 get), or a noSuchInstance
   -- exception (for an SNMPv2 get).

   -- Groups are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A given event may
   -- be recorded by more than one group, a message may be seen as
   -- stored by more than one group, and so on.  Groups should be all
   -- inclusive, however: if groups are implemented all aspects of an
   -- MTA's operation should be registered in at least one group. This
   -- freedom lets implementors use different sets of groups to
   -- provide differents "views" of an MTA.

   -- The possibility of overlap between groups means that summing
   -- variables across groups may not produce values equal to those in
   -- the mtaTable. mtaTable should always provide accurate information
   -- about the MTA as a whole.

   -- The term "channel" is often used in MTA implementations; channels
   -- are usually, but not always, equivalent to a group. However,
   -- this MIB does not use the term "channel" because there is no
   -- requirement that an MTA supporting this MIB has to map its
   -- "channel" abstraction one-to-one onto the MIB's group abstration.
