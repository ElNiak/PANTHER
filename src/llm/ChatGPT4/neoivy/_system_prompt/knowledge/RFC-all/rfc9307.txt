1.  Introduction

   The IETF, as an international Standards Developing Organization
   (SDO), hosts a diverse set of data about the IETF's history and
   development, current standardization activities, Internet protocols,
   and the institutions that comprise the IETF.  A large portion of this
   data is publicly available, yet it is underutilized as a tool to
   inform the work in the IETF or the broader research community that is
   focused on topics like Internet governance and trends in information
   and communication technologies (ICT) standard setting.

   The aim of the "IAB Workshop on Analyzing IETF Data (AID) 2021"
   workshop was to study how IETF data is currently used, to understand
   what insights can be drawn from that data, and to explore open
   questions around how that data may be further used in the future.

   These questions can inform a research agenda drawing from IETF data
   that fosters further collaborative work among interested parties,
   ranging from academia and civil society to industry and IETF
   leadership.

2.  Workshop Scope and Discussion

   The workshop was organized with two all-group discussion slots at the
   beginning and the end of the workshop.  In between, the workshop
   participants organized hackathon activities based on topics
   identified during the initial discussion and in submitted position
   papers.  The following topic areas were identified and discussed.

2.1.  Tools, Data, and Methods

   The IETF holds a wide range of data sources.  The main ones used are
   the mailinglist archives [Mail-Arch], RFCs [IETF-RFCs], and the
   datatracker [Datatracker].  The latter provides information on
   participants, authors, meeting proceedings, minutes, and more
   [Data-Overview].  Furthermore, there are statistics for the IETF
   websites [IETF-Statistics], the working group Github repositories,
   and the IETF survey data [Survey-Data].  There was discussion about
   the utility of download statistics for the RFCs themselves from
   different repos.

   There is a wide range of tools to analyze this data produced by IETF
   participants or researchers interested in the work of the IETF.  Two
   projects that presented their work at the workshop were BigBang
   [BigBang] and Sodestream's IETFdata [ietfdata] library.  The RFC
   Prolog Database was described in a submitted paper; see
   [Prolog-Database].  These projects could provide additional insight
   into existing IETF statistics [ArkkoStats] and datatracker statistics
   [DatatrackerStats], e.g., gender-related information.  Privacy issues
   and the implications of making such data publicly available were
   discussed as well.

   The datatracker itself is a community tool that welcomes
   contributions; for example, for additions to the existing interfaces
   or the statistics page directly, see the Datatracker Database
   Overview [Data-Overview].  At the time of the workshop, instructions
   about how to set up a local development environment could be found at
   IAB AID Workshop Data Resources [DataResources].  Questions or
   discussion about the datatracker and possible enhancements can be
   sent to tools-discuss@ietf.org.

2.2.  Observations on Affiliation and Industry Control

   A large portion of the submitted position papers indicated interest
   in researching questions about industry control in the
   standardization process (as opposed to individual contributions in a
   personal capacity), where industry control covers both a) technical
   contributions and the ability to successfully standardize these
   contributions and b) competition on leadership roles.  To assess
   these questions, investigating participant affiliations, including
   "indirect" affiliations (e.g., by tracking funding and changes in
   affiliation) was discussed.  The need to model company
   characteristics or stakeholder groups was also discussed.

   Discussion about the analysis of IETF data shows that affiliation
   dynamics are hard to capture due to the specifics of how the data is
   entered and because of larger social dynamics.  On the side of IETF
   data capture, affiliation is an open text field that causes people to
   write their affiliation down in different ways (e.g., capitalization,
   space, word separation, etc).  A common data format could contribute
   to analyses that compare SDO performance and behavior of actors
   inside and across standards bodies.  To help with this, a draft data
   model was developed during the hackathon portion of the workshop; the
   data model can be found in Appendix A.

   Furthermore, there is the issue of mergers, acquisitions, and
   subsidiary companies.  There is no authoritative exogenous source of
   variation for affiliation changes, so hand-collected and curated data
   is used to analyze changes in affiliation over time.  While this
   approach is imperfect, conclusions can be drawn from the data.  For
   example, in the case of mergers or acquisition where a small
   organization joins a large organization, this results in a
   statistically significant increase in likelihood of an individual
   being put in a working group chair position (see the document by
   Baron and Kanevskaia [LEADERSHIP-POSITIONS]).

2.3.  Community and Diversity

   The workshop participants were highly interested in using existing
   data to better understand who the current IETF community is.  They
   were also interested in the community's diversity and how to
   potentially increase it and thereby increase inclusivity, e.g.,
   understanding if there are certain factors that "drive people away"
   and why.  Inclusivity and transparency about the standardization
   process are generally important to keep the Internet and its
   development process viable.  As commented during the workshop
   discussion, when measuring and evaluating different angles of
   diversity, it is also important to understand the actual goals that
   are intended when increasing diversity, e.g., in order to increase
   competence (mainly technical diversity from different companies and
   stakeholder groups) or relevance (also regional diversity and
   international footprint).

   The discussion on community and diversity spanned from methods that
   draw from novel text mining, time series clustering, graph mining,
   and psycholinguistic approaches to understand the consensus mechanism
   to more speculative approaches about what it would take to build a
   feminist Internet.  The discussion also covered the data needed to
   measure who is in the community and how diverse it is.

   The discussion highlighted that part of the challenge is defining
   what diversity means and how to measure it, or as one participant
   highlighted, defining "who the average IETFer is".  There was a
   question about what to do about missing data or non-participating or
   underrepresented communities, like women, individuals from the
   African continent, and network operators.  In terms of how IETF data
   is structured, various researchers mentioned that it is hard to track
   conversations because mail threads split, merge, and change.  The
   ICANN-at-large model came up as an example of how to involve relevant
   stakeholders in the IETF that are currently not present.  Conversely,
   it is also interesting for outside communities (especially policy
   makers) to get a sense of who the IETF community is and keep them
   updated.

   The human element of the community and diversity was highlighted.  In
   order to understand the IETF community's diversity, it is important
   to talk to people (beyond text analysis).  In order to ensure
   inclusivity, individual participants must make an effort to, as one
   participant recounted, tell them their participation is valuable.

2.4.  Publications, Process, and Decision Making

   A number of submissions focused on the RFC publication process, on
   the development of standards and other RFCs in the IETF, and on how
   the IETF makes decisions.  This included work on technical decisions
   about the content of the standards, on procedural and process
   decisions, and on questions around how we can understand, model, and
   perhaps improve the standards process.  Some of the work considered
   what makes an RFC successful, how RFCs are used and referenced, and
   what we can learn about the importance of a topic by studying the
   RFCs, Internet-Drafts, and email discussions.

   There were three sets of questions to consider in this area.  The
   first question related to the success and failure of standards and
   considered:

   *  What makes a successful and good RFC?

   *  What makes the process of making RFCs successful?

   *  How are RFCs used and referenced once published?

   Discussion considered how to better understand the path from an
   Internet-Draft to an RFC, to see if there are specific factors that
   lead to successful development of an Internet-Draft into an RFC.
   Participants explored the extent to which this depends on the
   seniority and experience of the authors, on the topic and IETF area,
   on the extent and scope of mailing list discussion, and other
   factors, to understand whether success of an Internet-Draft can be
   predicted and whether interventions can be developed to increase the
   likelihood of success for work.

   The second question focused on decision making.

   *  How does the IETF make design decisions?

   *  What are the bottlenecks in effective decision making?

   *  When is a decision made?  And what is the decision?

   Difficulties here lie in capturing decisions and the results of
   consensus calls early in the process, and understanding the factors
   that lead to effective decision making.

   Finally, there were questions regarding what can be learned about
   protocols by studying IETF publications, processes, and decision
   making.  For example:

   *  Are there insights to be gained around how security concerns are
      discussed and considered in the development of standards?

   *  Is it possible to verify correctness of protocols and detect
      ambiguities?

   *  What can be learned by extracting insights from implementations
      and activities on implementation efforts?

   Answers to these questions will come from analysis of IETF emails,
   RFCs and Internet-Drafts, meeting minutes, recordings, Github data,
   and external data such as surveys, etc.

2.5.  Environmental Sustainability

   The final discussion session considered environmental sustainability.
   Topics included what the IETF's role with respect to climate change,
   both in terms of what is the environmental impact of the way the IETF
   develops standards and in terms of what is the environmental impact
   of the standards the IETF develops.

   Discussion started by considering how sustainable IETF meetings are,
   focusing on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions IETF
   meetings are responsible for and how can we make the IETF more
   sustainable.  Analysis looked at the home locations of participants,
   meeting locations, and carbon footprint of air travel and remote
   attendance to estimate the CO2 costs of an IETF meeting.  While the
   analysis is ongoing, initial results suggest that the costs of
   holding multiple in-person IETF meetings per year are likely
   unsustainable in terms of CO2 emission.

   The extent to which climate impacts are considered during the
   development and standardization of Internet protocols was discussed.
   RFCs and Internet-Drafts of active working groups were reviewed for
   relevant keywords to highlight the extent to which climate change,
   energy efficiency, and related topics were considered in the design
   of Internet protocols.  This review revealed the limited extent to
   which these topics have been considered.  There is ongoing work to
   get a fuller picture by reviewing meeting minutes and mail archives
   as well, but initial results show only limited consideration of these
   important issues.

3.  Hackathon Report

   The middle two days of the workshop were organized as a hackathon.
   The aims of the hackathon were to 1) acquaint people with the
   different data sources and analysis methods, 2) seek to answer some
   of the questions that came up during presentations on the first day
   of the workshop, and 3) foster collaboration among researchers to
   grow a community of IETF data researchers.

   At the end of Day 1, the plenary presentation day, people were
   invited to divide themselves into groups and select their own
   respective facilitators.  All groups had their own work space and
   could use their own communication methods and channels.  Furthermore,
   daily check-ins were organized during the two hackathon days.  On the
   final day, the hackathon groups presented their work in a plenary
   session.

   According to the co-chairs, the objectives of the hackathon have been
   met, and the output significantly exceeded expectations.  It allowed
   more interaction than academic conferences and produced some actual
   research results by people who had not collaborated before the
   workshop.

   Future workshops that choose to integrate a hackathon could consider
   asking participants to submit issues and questions beforehand
   (potentially as part of the position papers or the sign-up process)
   to facilitate the formation of groups.
