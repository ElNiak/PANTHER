1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.

   In particular, it defines a method of describing Synthetic Sources
   for Performance Monitoring (SSPM).  This is useful within the Remote
   Monitoring (RMON) framework [RFC3577] for performance monitoring in
   the cases where it is desirable to inject packets into the network
   for the purpose of monitoring their performance with the other MIBs
   in that framework.

   This memo also includes a MIB module.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   This document defines a MIB module for the purpose of remotely
   controlling synthetic sources (or 'active' probes) and sinks in order
   to enhance remote performance monitoring capabilities within IP
   networks and services.  Much work within the IETF exists related to
   performance monitoring.  One interesting aspect of this body of work
   is that it does not explicitly define an 'active' probe capability.
   An active probe capability is complimentary to existing capabilities,
   and this MIB module is developed to fill this void.

3.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

      o 'Performance monitoring' is the act of monitoring traffic for
        the purpose of evaluating a statistic of a metric related to the
        performance of the system.  A performance monitoring system is
        comprised of a) traffic generators, b) measurement, c) data
        reduction, and d) reporting.  The traffic generators may be
        natural sources, synthetic sources, or intrusive sources.

        o A 'synthetic source' is a device or an embedded software
        program that generates a data packet (or packets) and injects it
        (or them) onto the path to a corresponding probe or existing
        server solely in support of a performance monitoring function.
        A synthetic source may talk intrusively to existing application
        servers.

   The design goals for this MIB module are:

      o Complementing the overall performance management architecture
        being defined within the RMONMIB WG; refer to the RMONMIB
        framework document [RFC3577].  This MIB module is defined within
        the context of the APM-MIB [RFC3729].

      o Extensibility: the MIB module should be easily extended to
        include a greater set of protocols and applications for
        performance monitoring purposes.



Kalbfleisch, et al.         Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


      o Flexibility: the module should support both round-trip and one-
        way measurements.

      o Security: the control of the source and sink of traffic is
        handled by a management application, and communication is
        recommended via SNMPv3.

   This document is organized as follows.  The next section discusses
   the relationship of this MIB module to others from the RMONMIB and
   Distributed Management (DISMAN) working groups.  Then the structure
   of the MIB module is discussed.  Finally, the MIB module definitions
   are given.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB modules

   This MIB module is designed to be used in conjunction with the RMON
   MIB Working Group's two other MIB modules for application performance
   measurement: Application Performance Measurement MIB [RFC3729] and
   Transport Performance Metrics MIB [RFC4150].  These MIB modules
   define reporting capabilities for that framework.  The intent of this
   MIB module is to define a method for injecting packets into the
   network utilizing probe capabilities defined in the base MIB modules
   and measured with the reporting MIB modules.  Other reporting MIB
   modules may be used as well.

   Specifically, this MIB module uses the AppLocalIndex as defined in
   the APM-MIB to map measurement configuration information to
   definition and reporting structures defined in the APM-MIB.

5.  Relationship to Other Work

   Much work has already been done within the IETF that has a direct
   bearing on the development of active performance probe definitions.
   This body of work has been addressed in various working groups over
   the years.  In this section, we focus on the work of a) the IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group, b) the DISMAN working
   group, c) the RMON working group, d) the Application MIB (ApplMIB)
   working group, and e) the Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM)
   working group.

5.1.  IPPM

   The IPPM working group has defined in detail a set of performance
   metrics, sampling techniques, and associated statistics for
   transport-level or connectivity-level measurements.  The IPPM
   framework document [RFC2330] discusses numerous issues concerning
   sampling techniques, clock accuracy, resolution and skew, wire time
   versus host time, error analysis, etc.  Many of these are



Kalbfleisch, et al.         Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


   considerations for configuration and implementation issues discussed
   below.  The IPPM working group has defined several metrics and their
   associated statistics, including

      + a connectivity metric [RFC2678],

      + one-way delay metric [RFC2679],

      + one-way loss metric [RFC2680],

      + round-trip delay and loss metrics [RFC2681],

      + delay variation metric [RFC3393],

      + a streaming media metric [RFC3432],

      + a throughput metric [EBT] and [TBT], and

      + others are under development.

   These (or a subset) could form the basis for a set of active,
   connectivity-level, probe types designed for monitoring the quality
   of transport services.  A consideration of some of these metrics may
   form a set of work activities and a set of early deliverables for a
   group developing an active probe capability.

   During the early development of the SSPM-MIB, it became apparent that
   a one-way measurement protocol was required in order for the SSPM-MIB
   to control a one-way measurement.  This led to the current work with
   the IPPM WG on the development of the One-Way Measurement Protocol
   (OWDP) [ODP].  This work includes both the measurement protocol
   itself, as well as the development of a separate control protocol.
   This later control protocol is redundant with the current work on the
   SSPM-MIB.  The SSPM-MIB could be used as an alternative to the one-
   way delay control protocol.

5.2.  DISMAN

   The DISMAN working group has defined a set of 'active' tools for
   remote management.  Of relevance to this document are:

      + the pingMIB [RFC2925],

      + the DNS Lookup MIB [RFC2925],

      + the tracerouteMIB [RFC2925],





Kalbfleisch, et al.         Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


      + the scriptMIB [RFC3165], and

      + the expressionMIB [RFC2982].

   The pingMIB and tracerouteMIB define an active probe capability,
   primarily for the remote determination of path and path connectivity.
   There are some performance-related metrics collected from the
   pingMIB, and one could conceivably use these measurements for the
   evaluation of a limited set of performance statistics.  But there is
   a fundamental difference between determining connectivity and
   determining the quality of that connectivity.  However, in the
   context of performance monitoring, a fault can be viewed as not
   performing at all.  Therefore, both should be monitored with the same
   probes to reduce network traffic.

   The DNS Lookup MIB also includes some probe-like capabilities and
   performance time measurements for the DNS lookup.  This could be used
   to suggest details of a related session-level, active probe.

   The scriptMIB allows a network management application to distribute
   and manage scripts to remote devices.  Conceivably, these scripts
   could be designed to run a set of active probe monitors on remote
   devices.

5.3.  RMON

   The RMON working group has developed an extensive, passive monitoring
   capability defined in RFC 2819 [RFC2819] and RFC 2021 [RFC2021] as
   well as additional MIB modules.  Initially, the monitors collected
   statistics at the MAC layer, but the capability has now been extended
   to higher-layer statistics.  Higher-layer statistics are identified
   through the definition of a Protocol Directory [RFC2021].  See the
   RMONMIB framework document [RFC3577] for an overview of the RMONMIB
   capabilities.

   Within this context, the development of an active traffic source for
   performance monitoring fits well within the overall performance
   monitoring architecture being defined within the RMON WG.

5.4.  ApplMIB

   The ApplMIB working group defined a series of MIB modules that
   monitor various aspects of applications, processes, and services.

   The System Application MIB [RFC2287] describes a basic set of managed
   objects for fault, configuration, and performance management of
   applications from a systems perspective.  More specifically, the
   managed objects it defines are restricted to information that can be



Kalbfleisch, et al.         Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


   determined from the system itself and that does not require special
   instrumentation within the applications to make the information
   available.

   The Application MIB [RFC2564] complements the System Application MIB,
   providing for the management of applications' common attributes,
   which could not typically be observed without the cooperation of the
   software being managed.  There are attributes that provide
   information on application and communication performance.

   The WWW MIB [RFC2594] describes a set of objects for managing
   networked services in the Internet Community, particularly World Wide
   Web (WWW) services.  Performance attributes are available for the
   information about each WWW service, each type of request, each type
   of response, and top-accessed documents.

   In the development of synthetic application-level probes,
   consideration should be given to the relationship of the application
   MIB modules to the measurements being performed through a synthetic
   application-level probe.  Similar, cross-indexing issues arise within
   the context of the RMON monitoring and synthetic application-level
   active probes.

5.5.  SNMPCONF

   The Configuration Management with SNMP (SNMPCONF) working group has
   created the informational RFC 3512 [RFC3512], which outlines the most
   effective methods for using the SNMP Framework to accomplish
   configuration management.  This work includes recommendations for
   device-specific as well as network-wide (Policy) configuration.  The
   group is also chartered to write any MIB modules necessary to
   facilitate configuration management.  Specifically, they will write a
   MIB module that describes a network entity's capabilities and
   capacities, which can be used by management entities making policy
   decisions at a network level or device-specific level.

   Currently, the SNMPCONF working group is focused on the SNMP
   Configuration MIB for policy [RFC4011].  It is conceivable that one
   would want to monitor the performance of newly configured policies as
   they are implemented within networks.  This would require correlation
   of the implemented policy and a related performance monitoring policy
   that would specify synthetic probe definitions.  For synthetic
   probes, there would be a need for a configuration of a) a single
   probe, b) several probes, c) source and destination probes, and d)
   intermediate probes.  In addition, it may be necessary to configure
   any or all of these combinations simultaneously.  It is hoped that
   the work of SNMPCONF will suffice.  The scripting language defined by
   the SNMP Configuration MIB could allow for active monitoring to be



Kalbfleisch, et al.         Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


   activated and configured from a policy management script.  Further,
   the results of active monitoring could become arguments in further
   policy decisions.  This notion is reflected in the decision flow
   outlined in Figure 1 below.

5.6.  RTFM

   The Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) working group is
   concerned with issues relating to traffic flow measurements and usage
   reporting for network traffic and Internet accounting.  Various
   documents exist that describe requirements [RFC1272], traffic flow
   measurement architectures [RFC2722], and a traffic flow MIB
   [RFC2720].  The work in this group is focused on passive measurements
   of user traffic.  As such, its work is related to the monitoring work
   within the RMON WG.  Fundamentally, their attention has not been
   concerned with methods of active traffic generation.

5.7.  Relationship to Other Work: Summary

   In summary, the development of an active traffic generation
   capability (primarily for the purpose of performance monitoring)
   should draw upon various activities, both past and present, within
   the IETF.  Figure 1 shows the relationship of the various work
   activities briefly touched upon in this section.

   Horizontally, across the top of the figure are overall control
   functions, which would coordinate the various aspects of the
   performance monitoring systems.  Vertically at the bottom of the
   figure are the functions which comprise the minimum performance
   monitoring capability; i.e., traffic generation, monitoring and
   measurements, and data reduction.  Traffic generation is addressed in
   this MIB module.  Monitoring and measurement is addressed in the
   APM-MIB [RFC3729] and TPM-MIB [RFC4150] modules.  Data reduction is
   not yet addressed within the IETF.  But data reduction could include
   both spatial and temporal aggregations at different levels of
   reduction.  This is indicated in the figure by the arrow labeled
   "Various levels and span".

6.  MIB Structure

   This section presents the structure of the MIB module.  The objects
   are arranged into the following groups:

      o general information

      o source configuration

      o sink configuration

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


6.1.  General Information

   This section provides general information about the capabilities of
   the probe.  Currently, this information is related to the resolution
   of the probe clock and its source.

6.2.  Source Configuration

   The source is configured with a pair of tables.  The first,
   sspmSourceProfileTable, defines a set of profiles for monitoring.
   These profiles are then used by the second table,
   sspmSourceControlTable, to instantiate a specific measurement.  This
   MIB module takes an IP-centric view of the configuration of the
   measurement.

6.3.  Sink Configuration

   Configures the sink for measurements.  If the test is round-trip,
   then this table is on the same probe as the source configuration.  If
   the test is one-way, then the table is on a different probe.  The
   sspmSinkInstance is a unique identifier for the entry per probe.
   Additional attributes are provided for test type and test source to
   identify entries in the table uniquely.

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects that allow packets to be injected
   into the network for the purpose of measuring some performance
   characteristics.  As such, the MIB module may contain sensitive
   network and application data; e.g., user IDs and passwords.  Further,
   if security is compromised, this MIB module could provide a source
   for denial-of-service, and potential other, attacks.  These issues
   will be addressed within this section.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      + The sspmSourceProfileTable contains objects that configure link-
        level, IP, and application-level data used within test suites.
        These objects with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or
        read- create are:

         o sspmSourcePacketSize - configures the overall size of the
           test packets,

         o sspmSourceProfileTOS - sets the TOS field in the IPv4 and
           IPv6 headers,

         o sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteFill and
           sspmSourceProfileLooseSrcRteLen - give a list of IPv4 or IPv6
           addresses for the loose source route options in the IP
           headers,

         o sspmSourceProfileFlowLabel - sets the Flow Label in the IPv6
           header,

         o sspmSourceProfileTTL - sets the TTL field in the packet
           headers,

         o sspmSourceProfileNoFrag - sets the No Fragment bit in the
           packet headers,

         o sspmSourceProfile8021Tagging - sets the Tag field in the
           802.1 headers, and

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


         o sspmSourceProfileUsername and sspmSourceProfilePassword -
           these hold the ID and passwords specific to an application
           test profile.,

      + The sspmSourceControlTable contains objects that configure IP
        and application-level data used within a given test.  These
        objects with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
        create are:

         o sspmSourceControlSrc - controls the source IP address used on
           the test packets,

         o sspmSourceControlDestAddr - holds the destination address for
           the specific test packet,

         o sspmSourceControlTimeout, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist, and
           sspmSourceControlFrequency - control the nature and frequency
           of the test packet injection onto the network, and

         o sspmSourceControlFirstSeqNum and sspmSourceControlLastSeqNum
           - set the first and last sequence numbers for the specific
           test.

      + The sspmSinkTable contains objects that configure the recipient
        of the test packets.  As such, the objects in this table have no
        security issues related to them.

   Some attributes configure username and password information for some
   application-level protocols as indicated above.  Access to these
   attributes may provide unauthorized use of resources.  These
   attributes are: sspmSourceProfileUsername and
   sspmSourceProfilePassword.

   Some attributes configure the size and rate of traffic flows for the
   purpose of performance measurements.  Access to these attributes may
   exacerbate the use of this MIB module in denial-of-service attacks.
   It is possible to define a maximum packet rate on the device and to
   indicate this rate through the sspmSourceFrequency object.  This
   object reflects the maximum acceptable packet rate that a device
   supporting this MIB module is willing to generate.  This places a
   bound on setting the test packet rate through the
   sspmSourceControlFrequency object.  Other objects that control
   aspects of the test packets related to packet size and rate are
   sspmSourceControlTimeOut, sspmSourceControlSamplingDist and
   sspmSourceControlFrequency.






Kalbfleisch, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 33]

RFC 4149                        SSPM-MIB                     August 2005


   The objects sspmSourceControlSrc, sspmSourceControlDestAddr,
   sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteFill, and sspmSourceControlLooseSrcRteLen
   control the setting of the source and destination addresses on the
   packet headers and the routing of the packets.  The device should not
   allow the setting of source addresses on the test packets other than
   those that are administratively configured onto the device.  This is
   controlled by using the syntax InterfaceIndexOrZero for the control
   of the source address through the sspmSourceControlSrc object.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
