           RADIUS Attributes for Softwire Mechanisms Based on
                        Address plus Port (A+P)

Abstract

   IPv4-over-IPv6 transition mechanisms provide IPv4 connectivity
   services over IPv6 native networks during the IPv4/IPv6 coexistence
   period.  DHCPv6 options have been defined to configure clients for
   Lightweight 4over6, Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation
   (MAP-E), Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T)
   unicast softwire mechanisms, and multicast softwires.  However, in
   many networks, configuration information is stored in an
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server, which
   utilizes the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
   protocol to provide centralized management for users.  When a new
   transition mechanism is developed, new RADIUS attributes need to be
   defined correspondingly.

   This document defines new RADIUS attributes to carry softwire
   configuration parameters based on Address plus Port from a AAA server
   to a Broadband Network Gateway.  Both unicast and multicast
   attributes are covered.

1.  Introduction

   Providers have started deploying and transitioning to IPv6.  Several
   IPv4 service continuity mechanisms based on Address plus Port (A+P)
   [RFC6346] have been proposed for providing unicast IPv4-over-
   IPv6-only infrastructure, such as Mapping of Address and Port with
   Encapsulation (MAP-E) [RFC7597], Mapping of Address and Port using
   Translation (MAP-T) [RFC7599], and Lightweight 4over6 [RFC7596].
   Also, [RFC8114] specifies a generic solution for the delivery of IPv4
   multicast services to IPv4 clients over an IPv6 multicast network.
   For each of these mechanisms, DHCPv6 options have been specified for
   client configuration.

   In many networks, user configuration information is stored in an
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server.  AAA
   servers generally communicate using the Remote Authentication Dial In
   User Service (RADIUS) [RFC2865] protocol.  In a fixed broadband
   network, a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) acts as the access gateway
   for users.  That is, the BNG acts as both a AAA client to the AAA
   server and a DHCPv6 server for DHCPv6 messages sent by clients.
   Throughout this document, the term "BNG" describes a device
   implementing both the AAA client and DHCPv6 server functions.

   Since IPv4-in-IPv6 softwire configuration information is stored in a
   AAA server and user configuration information is mainly transmitted
   through DHCPv6 between the BNGs and Customer Premises Equipment (CEs,
   a.k.a., CPE), new RADIUS attributes are needed to propagate the
   information from the AAA servers to BNGs so that they can be provided
   to CEs using the existing DHCPv6 options.

   The RADIUS attributes defined in this document provide the
   configuration to populate the corresponding DHCPv6 options for
   unicast and multicast softwire configurations, specifically:

   *  "Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E)" [RFC7597]
      (DHCPv6 options defined in [RFC7598]).

   *  "Mapping of Address and Port using Translation (MAP-T)" [RFC7599]
      (DHCPv6 options defined in [RFC7598]).

   *  "Lightweight 4over6: An Extension to the Dual-Stack Lite
      Architecture" [RFC7596] (DHCPv6 options defined in [RFC7598]).

   *  "Unified IPv4-in-IPv6 Softwire Customer Premises Equipment (CPE):
      A DHCPv6-Based Prioritization Mechanism" [RFC8026].

   *  "Delivery of IPv4 Multicast Services to IPv4 Clients over an IPv6
      Multicast Network" [RFC8114] (DHCPv6 options defined in
      [RFC8115]).

   The contents of the attributes defined in this document have a 1:1
   mapping into the fields of the various DHCPv6 options in [RFC7598],
   [RFC8026], and [RFC8115].  Table 1 shows how the DHCPv6 options map
   to the corresponding RADIUS attribute.  For detailed mappings between
   each DHCPv6 option field and the corresponding RADIUS attribute or
   field, see Appendix A.

               Table 1: Mapping between DHCPv6 Options and
                            RADIUS Attributes

   A RADIUS attribute for Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] is defined in
   [RFC6519].

   This document targets deployments where a trusted relationship is in
   place between the RADIUS client and server.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The reader should be familiar with the concepts and terms defined in
   [RFC7596], [RFC7597], [RFC7599], and [RFC8026].

   The terms "multicast Basic Bridging BroadBand" element (mB4) and
   "multicast Address Family Transition Router" element (mAFTR) are
   defined in [RFC8114].

   Softwire46 (S46) is used throughout to denote any of the IPv4-in-IPv6
   softwire mechanisms listed above.  Additionally, the following
   abbreviations are used within the document:

   BNG:      Broadband Network Gateway

   BR:       Border Relay

   CE:       Customer Edge

   CoA:      Change-of-Authorization

   DMR:      Default Mapping Rule

   EA:       Embedded Address

   lwAFTR:   Lightweight Address Family Transition Router

   MAP-E:    Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation

   MAP-T:    Mapping of Address and Port using Translation

   PSID:     Port Set Identifier

   TLV:      Type, Length, Value

3.  New RADIUS Attributes

   This section defines the following attributes:

   1.  Softwire46-Configuration Attribute (Section 3.1):

       This attribute carries the configuration information for MAP-E,
       MAP-T, and Lightweight 4over6.  The configuration information for
       each Softwire46 mechanism is carried in the corresponding
       Softwire46 attributes.  Different attributes are required for
       each Softwire46 mechanism.

   2.  Softwire46-Priority Attribute (Section 3.2):

       Depending on the deployment scenario, a client may support
       several different Softwire46 mechanisms.  Therefore, a client may
       request configuration for more than one Softwire46 mechanism at a
       time.  The Softwire46-Priority Attribute contains information
       allowing the client to prioritize which mechanism to use,
       corresponding to OPTION_S46_PRIORITY defined in [RFC8026].

   3.  Softwire46-Multicast Attribute (Section 3.3):

       This attribute conveys the IPv6 prefixes to be used in [RFC8114]
       to synthesize IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses.  The BNG uses the
       IPv6 prefixes returned in the RADIUS Softwire46-Multicast
       Attribute to populate the DHCPv6 PREFIX64 Option [RFC8115].

   All of these attributes are allocated from the RADIUS "Extended Type"
   code space per [RFC6929].

   All of these attribute designs follow [RFC6158] and [RFC6929].

   This document adheres to the guidance in [RFC8044] for defining new
   RADIUS attributes.

3.1.  Softwire46-Configuration Attribute

   This attribute is of type "tlv", as defined in "Remote Authentication
   Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) Protocol Extensions" [RFC6929].  It
   contains some sub-attributes, with the following requirements:

   *  The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute MUST contain one or more of
      the following attributes: Softwire46-MAP-E, Softwire46-MAP-T, and/
      or Softwire46-Lightweight-4over6.

   *  The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute conveys the configuration
      information for MAP-E, MAP-T, or Lightweight 4over6.  The BNG
      SHALL use the configuration information returned in the RADIUS
      attribute to populate the DHCPv6 Softwire46 container option(s)
      defined in Section 5 of [RFC7598].

   *  The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute MAY appear in an Access-
      Accept packet.  It MAY also appear in an Access-Request packet to
      indicate a preferred Softwire46 configuration.  However, the
      server is not required to honor such a preference.

   *  The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute MAY appear in a CoA-Request
      packet.

   *  The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute MAY appear in an
      Accounting-Request packet.

   *  The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute MUST NOT appear in any
      other RADIUS packet.

   The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute is structured as follows:

   Type
      241

   Length
      Indicates the total length, in bytes, of all fields of this
      attribute, including the Type, Length, Extended-Type, and the
      entire length of the embedded attributes.

   Extended-Type
      9

   Value
      Contains one or more of the following attributes.  Each attribute
      type may appear once at most:

      Softwire46-MAP-E
         For configuring MAP-E clients.  For the construction of this
         attribute, refer to Section 3.1.1.1.

      Softwire46-MAP-T
         For configuring MAP-T clients.  For the construction of this
         attribute, refer to Section 3.1.1.2.

      Softwire46-Lightweight-4over6
         For configuring Lightweight 4over6 clients.  For the
         construction of this attribute, refer to Section 3.1.1.3.

   The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute is associated with the
   following identifier: 241.9.

3.1.1.  Softwire46 Attributes

   The Softwire46 attributes can only be encapsulated in the
   Softwire46-Configuration Attribute.  Depending on the deployment
   scenario, a client might request more than one transition mechanism
   at a time.  There MUST be at least one Softwire46 attribute
   encapsulated in one Softwire46-Configuration Attribute.  There MUST
   be at most one instance of each type of Softwire46 attribute
   encapsulated in one Softwire46-Configuration Attribute.

   There are three types of Softwire46 attributes, namely:

   1.  Softwire46-MAP-E (Section 3.1.1.1)

   2.  Softwire46-MAP-T (Section 3.1.1.2)

   3.  Softwire46-Lightweight 4over6 (Section 3.1.1.3)

   Each type of Softwire46 attribute contains a number of sub-
   attributes, defined in Section 3.1.3.  The hierarchy of the
   Softwire46 attributes is shown in Figure 1.  Section 3.1.2 describes
   which sub-attributes are mandatory, optional, or not permitted for
   each defined Softwire46 attribute.

                DHCPv6                         RADIUS

          Figure 2: Interaction between DHCPv6 and AAA Server with
                           RADIUS Authentication

   1.  The CE creates a DHCPv6 Solicit message.  For unicast softwire
       configuration, the message includes an OPTION_REQUEST_OPTION (6)
       with the Softwire46 Container option code(s) as defined in
       [RFC7598].  OPTION_S46_CONT_MAPE (94) should be included for MAP-
       E, OPTION_S46_CONT_MAPT (95) for MAP-T, and OPTION_S46_CONT_LW
       (96) for Lightweight 4over6.  For multicast configuration, the
       option number for OPTION_V6_PREFIX64 (113) is included in the
       client's Option Request Option (ORO).  The message is sent to the
       BNG.

   2.  On receipt of the DHCPv6 Solicit message, the BNG constructs a
       RADIUS Access-Request message containing a User-Name Attribute
       (1) (containing either a CE Media Access Control (MAC) address,
       interface-id, or both) and a User-Password Attribute (2) (with a
       preconfigured shared password between the CE and AAA server as
       defined in [RFC2865]).  The Softwire46-Configuration Attribute
       and/or Softwire46-Multicast Attribute are also included (as
       requested by the client).  The resulting message is sent to the
       AAA server.

   3.  The AAA server authenticates the request.  If this is successful,
       and a suitable configuration is available, an Access-Accept
       message is sent to the BNG containing the requested
       Softwire46-Configuration Attribute or Softwire46-Multicast
       Attribute.  It is the responsibility of the AAA server to ensure
       the consistency of the provided configuration.

   4.  The BNG maps the received softwire configuration into the
       corresponding fields in the DHCPv6 softwire configuration
       option(s).  These are included in the DHCPv6 Advertise message,
       which is sent to the CE.

   5.  The CE sends a DHCPv6 Request message.  In the ORO, the option
       codes of any of the required softwire options that were received
       in the DHCPv6 Advertise message are included.

   6.  The BNG sends a DHCPv6 Reply message to the client containing the
       softwire container option(s) enumerated in the ORO.

   The authorization operation could be done independently after the
   authentication process.  In this case, steps 1-5 are completed as
   above, then the following steps are performed:

   6a.  When the BNG receives the DHCPv6 Request, it constructs a RADIUS
        Access-Request message, which contains a Service-Type Attribute
        (6) with the value "Authorize Only" (17), the corresponding
        Softwire46-Configuration Attribute, and a State Attribute
        obtained from the previous authentication process according to
        [RFC5080].  The resulting message is sent to the AAA server.

   7a.  The AAA server checks the authorization request.  If it is
        approved, an Access-Accept message is returned to the BNG with
        the corresponding Softwire46-Configuration Attribute.

   8a.  The BNG sends a Reply message to the client containing the
        softwire container options enumerated in the ORO.

   In addition to the above, the following points need to be considered:

   *  In the configuration message flows described above, the Message-
      Authenticator (type 80) [RFC2869] should be used to protect both
      Access-Request and Access-Accept messages.

   *  If the BNG does not receive the corresponding
      Softwire46-Configuration Attribute in the Access-Accept message,
      it may fall back to creating the DHCPv6 softwire configuration
      options using the preconfigured Softwire46 configuration if this
      is present.

   *  If the BNG receives an Access-Reject from the AAA server, then the
      Softwire46 configuration must not be supplied to the client.

   *  As specified in Section 18.2.5 of [RFC8415] ("Creation and
      Transmission of Rebind Messages") if the DHCPv6 server to which
      the DHCPv6 Renew message was sent at time T1 has not responded by
      time T2, the CE (DHCPv6 client) should enter the Rebind state and
      attempt to contact any available server.  In this situation, a
      secondary BNG receiving the DHCPv6 message must initiate a new
      Access-Request message towards the AAA server.  The secondary BNG
      includes the Softwire46-Configuration Attribute in this Access-
      Request message.

   *  For Lightweight 4over6, the CE's binding state needs to be
      synchronized between the clients and the Lightweight AFTR
      (lwAFTR)/BR.  This can be achieved in two ways: static
      preconfiguration of the bindings on both the AAA server and lwAFTR
      or on demand, whereby the AAA server updates the lwAFTR with the
      CE's binding state as it is created or deleted.

   In some deployments, the DHCP server may use the Accounting-Request
   to report the softwire configuration returned to a requesting host to
   a AAA server.  It is the responsibility of the DHCP server to ensure
   the consistency of the configuration provided to the requesting
   hosts.  Reported data to a AAA server may be required for various
   operational purposes (e.g., regulatory).

   A configuration change (e.g., BR address) may result in an exchange
   of CoA-Requests between the BNG and the AAA server, as shown in
   Figure 3.  Concretely, when the BNG receives a CoA-Request message
   containing Softwire46 attributes, it sends a DHCPv6 Reconfigure
   message to the appropriate CE to inform that CE that an updated
   configuration is available.  Upon receipt of such a message, the CE
   sends a DHCPv6 Renew or Information-Request in order to receive the
   updated Softwire46 configuration.  In deployments where the BNG
   embeds a DHCPv6 relay, CoA-Requests can be used following the
   procedure specified in [RFC6977].

5.  Table of Attributes

   This document specifies three new RADIUS attributes, and their
   formats are as follows:

   *  Softwire46-Configuration Attribute: 241.9

   *  Softwire46-Priority Attribute: 241.10

   *  Softwire46-Multicast Attribute: 241.11

   Table 3 describes which attributes may be found in which kinds of
   packets and in what quantity.

6.  Security Considerations

   Section 9 of [RFC7596] discusses security issues related to
   Lightweight 4over6; Section 10 of [RFC7597] discusses security issues
   related to MAP-E; Section 13 of [RFC7599] discusses security issues
   related to MAP-T; and Section 9 of [RFC8114] discusses security
   issues related to the delivery of IPv4 multicast services to IPv4
   clients over an IPv6 multicast network.

   This document does not introduce any security issues inherently
   different from those already identified in Section 8 of [RFC2865] and
   Section 6 of [RFC5176] for CoA messages.  Known security
   vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol discussed in Section 7 of
   [RFC2607] and Section 7 of [RFC2869] apply to this specification.
   These well-established properties of the RADIUS protocol place some
   limitations on how it can safely be used, since there is some
   inherent requirement to trust the counterparty to not misbehave.

   Accordingly, this document targets deployments where a trusted
   relationship is in place between the RADIUS client and server, with
   communication optionally secured by IPsec or Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) [RFC6614].  The use of IPsec [RFC4301] for providing security
   when RADIUS is carried in IPv6 is discussed in [RFC3162].

   Security considerations for interactions between a Softwire46 CE and
   the BNG are discussed in Section 9 of [RFC7598] (DHCPv6 options for
   the configuration of Softwire46 address and port-mapped clients),
   Section 3 of [RFC8026] (a DHCPv6-based Softwire46 prioritization
   mechanism), and Section 5 of [RFC8115] (DHCPv6 options for
   configuration of IPv4-embedded IPv6 prefixes).

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made new code point assignments for RADIUS attributes as
   described in the following subsections.  The assignments should use
   the RADIUS registry available at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   radius-types/>.

7.1.  New RADIUS Attributes

   IANA has assigned the attribute types defined in this document from
   the RADIUS namespace as described in Section 2 (IANA Considerations)
   of [RFC3575], in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC8126].

   IANA has registered three new RADIUS attributes from the "Short
   Extended Space" section of [RFC6929].  The attributes are the
   Softwire46-Configuration Attribute, Softwire46-Priority Attribute,
   and Softwire46-Multicast Attribute:

      +--------+--------------------------+-----------+-------------+
      | Type   | Description              | Data Type | Reference   |
      +========+==========================+===========+=============+
      | 241.9  | Softwire46-Configuration | tlv       | Section 3.1 |
      +--------+--------------------------+-----------+-------------+
      | 241.10 | Softwire46-Priority      | tlv       | Section 3.2 |
      +--------+--------------------------+-----------+-------------+
      | 241.11 | Softwire46-Multicast     | tlv       | Section 3.3 |
      +--------+--------------------------+-----------+-------------+

                       Table 4: New RADIUS Attributes

7.2.  RADIUS Softwire46 Configuration and Multicast Attributes

   IANA has created a new registry called "RADIUS Softwire46
   Configuration and Multicast Attributes".

   All attributes in this registry have one or more parent RADIUS
   attributes in nesting (refer to [RFC6929]).

   This registry has been initially populated with the following values:

    +--------+-------------------------------+------------+-----------+
    | Value  | Description                   | Data Type  | Reference |
    +========+===============================+============+===========+

     Table 5: RADIUS Softwire46 Configuration and Multicast Attributes

   The registration procedure for this registry is Standards Action as
   defined in [RFC8126].

7.3.  Softwire46 Mechanisms and Their Identifying Option Codes

   The Softwire46-Priority Attribute conveys an ordered list of option
   codes assigned to Softwire46 mechanisms, for which IANA has created
   and will maintain a new registry titled "Option Codes Permitted in
   the Softwire46-Priority Attribute".

   Table 6 shows the initial version of allowed option codes and the
   Softwire46 mechanisms that they represent.  The option code for DS-
   Lite is derived from the IANA-allocated RADIUS Attribute Type value
   for DS-Lite [RFC6519].  The option codes for MAP-E, MAP-T, and
   Lightweight 4over6 are the TLV-Type values for the MAP-E, MAP-T, and
   Lightweight 4over6 attributes defined in Section 3.1.1.

            +-------------+----------------------+-----------+
            | Option Code | Softwire46 Mechanism | Reference |
            +=============+======================+===========+
            | 1           | MAP-E                | [RFC7597] |
            +-------------+----------------------+-----------+
            | 2           | MAP-T                | [RFC7599] |
            +-------------+----------------------+-----------+
            | 3           | Lightweight 4over6   | [RFC7596] |
            +-------------+----------------------+-----------+
            | 144         | DS-Lite              | [RFC6519] |
            +-------------+----------------------+-----------+

                 Table 6: Option Codes to S46 Mechanisms

   Additional option codes may be added to this list in the future using
   the IETF Review process described in Section 4.8 of [RFC8126].
