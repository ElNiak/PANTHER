   RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report (XR) Block for MPEG-2
  Transport Stream (TS) Program Specific Information (PSI) Independent
               Decodability Statistics Metrics Reporting

Abstract

   An MPEG-2 Transport Stream (TS) is a standard container format used
   in the transmission and storage of multimedia data.  Unicast/
   multicast MPEG-2 TS over RTP is widely deployed in IPTV systems.
   This document defines an RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Report
   (XR) block that allows the reporting of MPEG-2 TS decodability
   statistics metrics related to transmissions of MPEG-2 TS over RTP.
   The metrics specified in the RTCP XR block are not dependent on
   Program Specific Information (PSI) carried in MPEG-2 TS.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  MPEG-2 Transport Stream Decodability Metrics

   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has
   defined a set of syntax and information consistency tests and
   corresponding indicators [ETSI] that are recommended for the
   monitoring of MPEG-2 Transport Streams [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2013].  The
   tests and corresponding indicators are grouped according to priority:

   o  First priority - Necessary for decodability (basic monitoring)

   o  Second priority - Recommended for continuous or periodic
      monitoring

   o  Third priority - Recommended for application-dependent monitoring

   This memo is based on information consistency tests and resulting
   indicators defined by ETSI [ETSI] and defines a new block type to
   augment those defined in [RFC3611] for use with MPEG-2 Transport
   Stream (TS) [ISO-IEC.13818-1.2013].  The new block type supports
   reporting of the number of occurrences of each PSI-independent
   indicator in the first and second priorities; third priority
   indicators are not supported.

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   "Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"
   [RFC6390] provides guidance on the definition and specification of
   performance metrics.  "Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring
   Framework" [RFC6792] provides guidance on the reporting block format
   using RTCP XR.  The new report block described in this memo is in
   compliance with the monitoring architecture specified in [RFC6792]
   and the performance metrics framework [RFC6390].

RFC 6990                 RTCP XR TS Decodability             August 2013


1.4.  Applicability

   This block type allows a count of MPEG-2 Transport Stream quality
   metrics that are measured in accordance with ETSI TR 101290 [ETSI] to
   be reported by an endpoint.  These metrics are useful for identifying
   bitstream packetization and transport stream encoding problems that
   may affect the user's perception of a video service delivered over
   RTP.

2.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  MPEG-2 TS PSI-Independent Decodability Statistics Metrics Block

   ETSI TR 101290 [ETSI] generally defines metrics related to error
   events while this document contains counts of those metrics defined
   in [ETSI].  The block defined in this document reports MPEG-2 TS PSI-
   independent decodability statistics metrics beyond the information
   carried in the standard RTCP packet format, which are measured at the
   receiving end of the RTP stream.  It contains counts of eight metrics
   defined in ETSI TR 101290 [ETSI].  Information is reported about
   basic monitoring parameters necessary to ensure that the TS can be
   decoded, including:

   o  Transport Stream Synchronization Losses

   o  Sync byte errors

   o  Continuity count errors

   and continuous monitoring parameters necessary to ensure the
   continuous decoding, including:

   o  Transport errors

   o  Program Clock Reference (PCR) errors

   o  PCR repetition errors

   o  PCR discontinuity indicator errors

   o  PCR accuracy errors

   o  Presentation Time Stamp (PTS) errors

   The other parameters are ignored since they do not apply to all
   MPEG-2 implementations.  For further information on these parameters,
   see [ETSI].  Note that when the report of this block spans across
   more than one measurement interval [RFC6776], the count of the
   metrics (e.g., Sync byte errors and PCR errors) defined in [ETSI] may
   reflect a problem in the current or previous measurement interval.

   The MPEG-2 TS PSI-Independent Decodability Statistics Metrics Block
   has the following format:

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The constant 11, in accordance with the definition of this field
      in Section 3 of RFC 3611.  The block MUST be discarded if the
      block length is set to a different value.


   Synchronization source (SSRC) of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611.


   begin_seq: 16 bits

      The RTP sequence number corresponding to the start of the
      measurement period, as defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611.


   end_seq: 16 bits

      The RTP sequence number corresponding to the end of the
      measurement period, as defined in Section 4.1 of RFC 3611.


   TS_sync_loss_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of TS_sync_loss errors that occurred in the
      above sequence number interval.  A TS_sync_loss error occurs when
      there are two or more consecutive incorrect sync bytes within the
      MPEG-2 TS, as defined in Section 5.2.1 of [ETSI].


   Sync_byte_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of Sync_byte_errors that occurred in the
      above sequence number interval.  A sync byte error occurs when the
      sync byte is not equal to 0x47 in any TS packet contained in the
      MPEG-2 TS, as defined in Section 5.2.1 of [ETSI].


   Continuity_count_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of Continuity_count_errors that occurred in
      the above sequence number interval.  A Continuity_count_error
      occurs when any of the following faults happen within the MPEG-2
      TS -- incorrect packet order, a packet occurs more than twice, or
      a packet is lost, as defined in Section 5.2.1 of [ETSI].

      defined in Section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].


   PCR_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of PCR_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PCR_error occurs if the primary clock
      reference (PCR) is not seen for more than 100 ms within the MPEG-2
      TS, as defined in Section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].  The time interval
      between two consecutive PCR values should be no more than 40 ms.


   PCR_repetition_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of PCR_repetition_errors that occurred in
      the above sequence number interval.  A PCR_repetition_error occurs
      when the time interval between two consecutive PCR values is more

   PTS_error_count: 32 bits

      A count of the number of PTS_errors that occurred in the above
      sequence number interval.  A PTS_error occurs when the PTS
      repetition is more than 700 ms within the MPEG-2 TS, as defined in
      Section 5.2.2 of [ETSI].  Note that the PTS is contained in the
      MPEG-2 TS and is used to aid the decoder in presenting the program
      on time, at the correct speed, and synchronized.

4.  SDP Signaling

   RFC 3611 defines the use of the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of RTCP XR blocks.  However, XR
   blocks MAY be used without prior signaling (see Section 5 of RFC
   3611).

4.1.  SDP rtcp-xr Attribute Extension

   This session augments the SDP attribute "rtcp-xr" defined in
   Section 5.1 of RFC 3611 by providing an additional value of
   "xr-format" to signal the use of the report block defined in this
   document.  The ABNF [RFC5234] syntax is as follows.

   xr-format =/  xr-tpid-block

   xr-tpid-block = "ts-psi-indep-decodability"

4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in Offer/Answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameters, refer to Section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

5.  IANA Considerations

   New report block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.
   For general guidelines on IANA allocations for RTCP XR, refer to
   Section 6.2 of RFC 3611.

5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type Value

   This document assigns the block type value 22 in the IANA "RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry" to
   the "MPEG-2 Transport Stream PSI-Independent Decodability Statistics
   Metrics Block".

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers the new parameter "ts-psi-
   indep-decodability" in the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports
   (RTCP XR) Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact Information for Registrations

   The contact information for registrations is:

   Qin Wu (sunseawq@huawei.com)
   101 Software Avenue, Yuhua District
   Nanjing, Jiangsu  210012
   China

6.  Security Considerations

   There might be some relationship between reported error counters and
   contractual Service Level Agreements (SLAs); hence, an attack (e.g.,
   RTP endpoints reporting false data, or an attacker in the path
   modifying the data being reported) might deliberately corrupt these
   error counters, resulting in financial implications for the network
   operator (either as a result of unneeded performance metrics, or
   penalty charges for SLA failure).

   A solution to prevent such an attack is to apply an authentication
   and integrity protection framework for the RTCP XR block.  This can
   be accomplished using the RTP profile that combines Secure RTP
   [RFC3711] and the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback (AVPF) into
   Secure AVPF (SAVPF) [RFC5124].

   Besides this, the RTCP XR block in this document introduces no new
   security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
