             Really Explicit Congestion Notification (RECN)

Abstract

   This document proposes a new ICMP message that a router or host may
   use to advise a host to reduce the rate at which it sends, in cases
   where the host ignores other signals provided by packet loss and
   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).

1.  Introduction

   The deployment of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168]
   remains stalled.  While most operating systems support ECN, it is
   currently disabled by default because of fears that enabling ECN will
   break transport protocols.  This document proposes a new ICMP message
   that a router or host may use to advise a host to reduce the rate at
   which it sends, in cases where the host ignores other signals such as
   packet loss and ECN.  We call this message the "Really Explicit
   Congestion Notification" (RECN) message because it delivers a less
   subtle indication of congestion than packet loss and ECN.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Checksum

      The checksum is the 16-bit ones's complement of the one's
      complement sum of the ICMP message starting with the ICMP type
      field.  When an RECN message is encapsulated in an IPv6 packet,
      the computation includes a "pseudo-header" of IPv6 header fields
      as specified in Section 8.1 of [RFC2460].  For computing the
      checksum, the checksum field is first set to zero.

   Explicit Notification

      A 4-byte value that conveys an explicit notification in the ASCII
      format defined in [RFC20].  This field MUST NOT be set to zero.

   Description

      An RECN message SHOULD be sent by a router in response to a host
      that is generating traffic at a rate persistently unfair to other
      competing flows and that has not reacted to previous packet losses
      or ECN marks.

      The contents of an RECN message MUST be conveyed to the user
      responsible for the traffic.  Precisely how this is accomplished
      will depend on the capabilities of the host.  If text-to-speech
      capabilities are available, the contents should be converted to
      sound form and audibly rendered.  If the system is currently
      muted, a pop-up message will suffice.

2.1.  Advice to Implementers

   As the Explicit Notification field is only 4 bytes, it is not
   required that the word be null terminated.  A client implementation
   should be careful not to use more than those 4 bytes.  If a router
   chooses a word less than 4 bytes in size, it should null-terminate
   that word.

   A router should not necessarily send an RECN message every time it
   discards a packet due to congestion.  Rather, a router should send
   these messages whenever it discards a burst of packets from a single
   sender.  For every packet a router discards in a single burst, it
   should send an RECN message.  A router may form short sentences
   composed of different 4-byte words, and a host should play these
   sentences back to the user.  A router may escalate the content in the
   Explicit Notification field if it determines that a sender has not

   adjusted its transmission rate in response to previous RECN messages.
   There is no upper bound on the intensity of the escalation, either in
   content or sentence length.

2.2.  Relationship to ICMP Source Quench

   The RECN message was inspired by the ICMP Source Quench message,
   which is now deprecated [RFC6633].  Because the RECN message uses a
   similar approach, an RECN message uses the same ICMP type when
   encapsulated in IPv4 as was used by the ICMP Source Quench message.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This is an Experimental RFC; the experiment will conclude two years
   after the publication of this RFC.  During the experiment,
   implementers are free to use words of their own choosing (up to four
   letters) in RECN messages.  If RECN becomes a Standard of any kind, a
   list of allowed words will be maintained in an IANA registry.  There
   are no IANA actions required at this time.

4.  Security Considerations

   ICMP messages may be used in various attacks [RFC5927].  An attacker
   may use the RECN message to cause a host to reduce their transmission
   rate for no reason.  To prevent such an attack, a host must ensure
   the quoted message corresponds to an active flow on the system, and
   an attacker MUST set the security flag defined in [RFC3514] to 1 when
   the RECN message is carried in an IPv4 packet.
