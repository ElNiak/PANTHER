Abstract

   This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the
   Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema (RFC
   3703) based on the model extensions defined by the Policy Core
   Information Model (PCIM) Extensions (RFC 3460).  These changes and
   extensions consist of new LDAP object classes and attribute types.
   Some of the schema items defined in this document re-implement
   existing concepts in accordance with their new semantics introduced
   by RFC 3460.  The other schema items implement new concepts, not
   covered by RFC 3703.  This document updates RFC 3703.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the
   Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema
   [PCLS] based on the model extensions defined by the Policy Core
   Information Model (PCIM) Extensions [PCIM_EXT].  These changes and
   extensions consist of new LDAP object classes and attribute types
   [LDAP].  Some of the schema items defined in this document re-
   implement existing concepts in accordance with their new semantics
   introduced by [PCIM_EXT].  The other schema items implement new
   concepts, not covered by [PCLS].  This document updates RFC 3703
   [PCLS].

   In addition to the concepts defined by [PCIM_EXT], this document
   introduces two new classes: pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and
   pcelsVendorValueAuxClass.  These classes provide a standard extension
   mechanism for vendor-specific policy variables and policy values that
   have not been specifically modeled.

   Within the context of this document, the term "PCELS" (Policy Core
   Extension LDAP Schema) is used to refer to the LDAP object class,
   attribute type definitions and the associated recommendations
   contained in this document.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].

2.  Relationship to Other Policy Framework Documents

   This document contains an LDAP schema mapping for the classes defined
   in the "Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions" [PCIM_EXT].
   The LDAP schema defined in this document is an extension to the
   "Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema"
   [PCLS], which defines the mapping of the "Policy Core Information
   Model -- Version 1 Specification" [PCIM] to an LDAP schema.

   These three documents ([PCIM], [PCIM_EXT] and [PCLS]) are
   prerequisites for reading and understanding this document.

   Other documents may subsequently be produced with mappings of the
   same model to other storage or transport technologies.

3.  Inheritance Hierarchy for PCELS

   The object class and attribute type names defined in this document
   are prefixed 'pcels'.

   The diagram below illustrates the combined class hierarchy for the
   LDAP object classes defined in the following documents:

   - The class names prefixed 'pcels' are defined in this document.
   - The class names prefixed 'pcim' are defined in [PCLS].
   - The class names prefixed 'dlm1' are defined in [CIM_LDAP].
   - The class named 'top' is defined in [LDAP_SCHEMA].

   All the new object classes except for pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and
   pcelsVendorValueAuxClass, are mapped from concepts defined or
   modified by [PCIM_EXT].  The pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and
   pcelsVendorValueAuxClass classes are not mapped from [PCIM_EXT].
   They represent concepts introduced in this document.

4.  General Discussion of Mapping the Policy Core Information Model
    Extensions to LDAP

   The object classes described in this document contain certain
   optimizations for a directory that uses LDAP as its access protocol.
   An example is the use of auxiliary class attachment to LDAP entries
   for the realization of some of the associations defined in the
   information model.  For instance, the aggregation of a specific
   SimplePolicyCondition to a reusable PolicyRule [PCIM_EXT] may be
   realized by attaching a pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass to a
   pcelsRuleInstance entry.

   Note that other data stores might need to implement the associations
   differently.

4.1.  Summary of Class Mappings

   The classes and their properties defined in the information model
   [PCIM_EXT] map directly to LDAP object classes and attribute types.

   The details of this mapping are discussed case by case in section 5.

     Figure 2.  Mapping of Information Model Extension Classes to LDAP

   The pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass and pcelsVendorValueAuxClass classes
   are not mapped from [PCIM_EXT].  These classes are introduced in this
   document as a new extension mechanism for vendor-specific policy
   variables and values that have not been specifically modeled.  Just
   like for any other schema elements defined in this document or in

   [PCLS], a particular submodel schema generally will not need to use
   vendor specific variable and value classes.   Submodel schemas SHOULD
   apply the recommendations of section 5.10 of [PCIM_EXT] with regards
   to the supported and unsupported elements.

4.2.  Summary of Association Mappings

   The associations in the information model map to one or more of the
   following options:

      1.  Attributes that reference DNs (Distinguished Names)
      2.  Directory Information Tree (DIT) containment
          (i.e., superior-subordinate relationships) in LDAP
      3.  Auxiliary class attachment
      4.  Association object classes and attributes that reference DNs

   The details of this mapping are discussed case by case in section 5.

 Figure 3.  Mapping of Information Model Extension Associations to LDAP



Pana, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 12]

   Two [PCIM_EXT] associations are mapped to DIT containment:

      - PolicyRoleCollectionInSystem is a weak association and weak
        associations map well to DIT containment [CIM_LDAP] (without
        being limited to this mapping).  In the absence of additional
        constraints, DIT containment is chosen here as the optimal
        association mapping.

      - ReusablePolicy is mapped to DIT containment for scalability
        reasons.  It is expected that applications will associate a
        large number of policy instances to a ReusablePolicyContainer
        and DIT containment is a type of association that scales well.

4.3.  Summary of Changes since PCLS

   This section provides an overview of the changes relative to [PCLS]
   defined in this document:

   1.  The concept of a set of policies is introduced by two new object
       classes: pcelsPolicySet and pcelsPolicySetAssociation.  These
       classes enable the aggregation and relative prioritization of
       policies (rules and/or groups).  The attribute pcelsPriority is
       used by pcelsPolicySetAssociation instances to indicate the
       priority of a policy relative to the other policies aggregated by
       the same set.  Applications may use this attribute to apply
       appropriate ordering to the aggregated policies.  This new policy
       aggregation mechanism provides an alternative to the aggregation
       mechanism defined by [PCLS] (that defines
       pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass and/or pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass
       for attaching components to a pcimGroup).

   2.  The attribute pcimRoles defined by [PCLS] is used here by the
       pcelsPolicySet object class.  Thus, the role based policy
       selection mechanism is extended to all the subclasses of
       pcelsPolicySet.

   3.  A new attribute pcelsDecisionStrategy is added on the
       pcelsPolicySet class as a mapping from the decision mechanism.

   4.  A new class pcelsGroup (with two subclasses), implements the
       modified semantics of the PolicyGroup in accordance with
       [PCIM_EXT].  This new class inherits from its superclass
       pcelsPolicySet the ability to aggregate (with relative priority)
       other policy rules or groups.

   5.  A new class pcelsRule (with two subclasses), implements the
       modified semantics of the PolicyRule in accordance with
       [PCIM_EXT].  It does not include an absolute priority attribute,



Pana, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 4104                         PCELS                         June 2005


       but instances of non-abstract subclasses of pcelsRule can be
       prioritized relative to each other within a System (behavior
       inherited from its superclass: pcelsPolicySet).  The pcelsRule
       class also inherits from pcelsPolicySet the ability to aggregate
       other policy rules or groups, and thus, the ability to construct
       nested rule structures of arbitrary complexity.

   6.  A new attribute pcelsExecutionStrategy is added to the pcelsRule
       and pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass classes to allow the
       specification of the expected behavior in case of multiple
       actions aggregated by a rule or by a compound action.

   7.  Compound Conditions: The pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass class is
       added in order to map the CompoundPolicyCondition class.  A new
       class, pcelsConditionAssociation is used to aggregate policy
       conditions in a pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass.  The same class
       is also used to aggregate policy conditions in a pcelsRule.

   8.  Compound Actions: The pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass class is added
       in order to map the CompoundPolicyAction class.  A new class,
       pcelsActionAssociation is used to aggregate policy actions in a
       pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass.  The same class is also used to
       aggregate policy actions in a pcelsRule.

   9.  Simple Conditions, Simple Actions, Variables and Values: The
       simple condition, simple action, variable and value classes
       defined by [PCIM_EXT] are directly mapped to LDAP object classes.
       These are:  pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass,
       pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass, pcelsVariable and its subclasses, and
       pcelsValueAuxClass and its subclasses.

   10.  A general extension mechanism is introduced for representing
        policy variables and values that have not been specifically
        modeled.  The mechanism is intended for vendor-specific
        extensions.

   11.  Reusable Policy Repository: A new class (with two subclasses),
        pcelsReusableContainer is created as a subclass of
        pcimRepository.  While maintaining compatibility with older
        [PCLS] implementations, the addition of this class acknowledges
        the intent of [PCIM_EXT] to avoid the potential for confusion
        with the Policy Framework component named Policy Repository.
        The new class enables many-to-many associations between reusable
        policy containers.

   12.  The ReusablePolicy association defined in [PCIM_EXT] is realized
        through subordination to an instance of a non-abstract subclass
        of pcelsReusableContainer.  Thus, reusable policy components

RFC 4104                         PCELS                         June 2005


        (groups, rules, conditions, actions, variables and values) may
        be defined as stand-alone entries or stand-alone groups of
        related entries subordinated (DIT contained) to a
        pcelsReusableContainer.

   13.  Device level filter classes are added to the schema.

   14.  The pcelsRoleCollection class is added to the schema to allow
        the association of policy roles to resources represented as LDAP
        entries.

4.4.  Relationship to PCLS Classes

   Several [PCLS] classes are used in this document to derive other
   classes.  If a PCELS application requires a functionality provided by
   any of derived classes, then the [PCLS] class MUST also be supported
   by PCELS implementations.  These classes are:

    pcimPolicy
    pcimRuleConditionAssociation
    pcimRuleActionAssociation
    pcimConditionAuxClass
    pcimActionAuxClass
    pcimRepository

   Other [PCLS] classes are neither derived to nor superseded by classes
   defined in this document.  If a PCELS application requires a
   functionality provided by any of these classes, then the [PCLS] class
   SHOULD be used.  These classes are:

    pcimRuleValidityAssociation
    pcimTPCAuxClass
    pcimConditionVendorAuxClass
    pcimActionVendorAuxClass
    pcimPolicyInstance
    pcimElementAuxClass
    pcimSubtreesPtrAuxClass

   Among the classes defined in this document some implement concepts
   that supersede the concepts implemented by similar [PCLS] classes.
   PCELS implementations MAY support such [PCLS] classes.  These classes
   are:

    pcimGroup and its subclasses
    pcimRule and its subclasses
    pcimGroupContainmentAuxClass
    pcimRuleContainmentAuxClass
    the subclasses of pcimRepository

4.5.  Impact on Existing Implementations of the Policy Core LDAP Schema

    In general, the intent of PCELS is to extend the functionality
    offered by the Policy Core LDAP Schema.  For the most part, the
    compatibility with [PCLS] is preserved.  The few cases in which
    compatibility cannot be achieved due to fundamental changes imposed
    by [PCIM_EXT], are defined here as alternatives to the original
    implementation.

    PCELS does not obsolete nor deprecate the concepts implemented by
    [PCLS].  The new LDAP schema items are defined in this document in a
    way that avoids, to the extent possible, interference with the
    normal operation of a reasonably well-executed implementation of
    [PCLS].  The intent is to permit at least a harmless coexistence of
    the two models in the same data repository.

    However, it should be noted that the PCELS introduces the following
    changes that may have an impact on some [PCLS] implementations:

   1.  Some attributes originally used only by pcimRule or pcimGroup are
       now also used by classes unknown to [PCLS] implementations
       (pcelsPolicySet, pcelsRule and pcelsGroup).  In particular, the
       attribute pcimRoles is also used by pcelsPolicySet for role based
       policy selection.

   2.  Condition and action association classes originally used by only
       pcimRule are now used (through subclasses) by pcelsRule as well.

   3.  pcimRepository containers may include entries of types unknown to
       [PCLS] implementations.

   When the choice exists, PCELS implementations SHOULD support the new
   schema and MAY also support the one defined by [PCLS].  For example,
   if PolicyRule support is required, an implementation SHOULD be able
   to read or read-write (as applicable) pcelsRule entries.  The same
   implementation MAY be able to read or read-write pcimRule.

4.6.  The Association of PolicyVariable and PolicyValues
      to PolicySimpleCondition and PolicySimpleAction

   A PolicySimpleCondition, as well as a PolicySimpleAction, includes a
   single PolicyValue and a single PolicyVariable.  Each of them can be
   attached or referenced by a DN.

   The attachment helps create compact PolicyCondition and PolicyAction
   definitions that can be efficiently provisioned and retrieved from
   the repository.  On the other hand, referenced PolicyVariables and
   PolicyValues instances can be reused in the construction of multiple
   policies and permit an administrative partitioning of the data and
   policy definitions.

4.7.  The Aggregation of PolicyRules and PolicyGroups in PolicySets

   In [PCIM_EXT], the two aggregations PolicyGroupInPolicyGroup and
   PolicyRuleInPolicyGroup, are combined into a single aggregation
   PolicySetComponent.  This aggregation and the capability of
   association between a policy and the ReusablePolicyContainer offer
   new possibilities of reusability.  Furthermore, these aggregations
   introduce new semantics representing the execution of one PolicyRule
   within the scope of another PolicyRule.

   Since PolicySet is defined in [PCIM_EXT], it is mapped in this
   document to a new class pcelsPolicySet in order to provide an
   abstraction for a set of policy rules or groups.  The aggregation
   class PolicySetComponent in [PCIM_EXT] is mapped to a multi-value
   attribute pcelsPolicySetList in the pcelsPolicySet class and the
   attribute pcelsPolicySetDN in the pcelsPolicySetAssociation.  These
   attributes refer to the nested rules and groups.

   It is possible to store a rule/group nested in another rule/group in
   two ways.  The first way is to define the nested rule/group as
   specific to the nesting rule/group.  The second way is to define the
   nested rules/groups as reusable.

   These structural association classes are subordinated (DIT contained)
   to an instance of a non-abstract subclass of pcelsPolicySet and
   represent the association between the PolicySet and its nested
   rules/groups.  The reusable rules/groups are instantiated here as
   auxiliary classes and attached to pcimPolicyInstance entries in the
   reusable container.  Another option is to use the structural
   subclasses for defining reusable rules/groups.  The association
   classes belonging to a nesting policy set are reference the reusable
   rules/groups using the attribute pcelsPolicySetDN.

   A combination of both specific and reusable components is also
   allowed for the same policy set.

4.8.  The Aggregation of Actions/Conditions in PolicyRules and
      CompoundActions/CompoundConditions

   [PCIM_EXT] defines two new classes that allow the designer to create
   more complex conditions and actions.  CompoundPolicyCondition and
   CompoundPolicyAction classes are mapped in this document to
   pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass and pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass
   classes that are subclasses of
   pcimConditionAuxClass/pcimActionAuxClass.  The compound
   conditions/actions defined in [PCIM_EXT] extend the capability of the
   rule to associate, group and evaluate conditions or execute actions.
   The conditions/actions are associated to compounds conditions/actions
   in the same way as they are associated to the rules.

   In this section, how to store instances of these classes in an LDAP
   Directory is explained.  As a general rule, specific
   conditions/actions are subordinated (DIT contained) to the rule or
   compound condition/action that aggregates them and are attached to
   association class instances.  Reusable conditions/actions are
   subordinated to pcelsReusableContainer instances and attached to
   pcimPolicyInstance instances.

   The examples below illustrate the four possible cases combining
   specific/reusable compound/non-compound condition/action.  The rule
   has two compound conditions, each one has two different conditions.
   The schemes can be extended in order to store actions.

   The examples below are based on and extend those illustrated in the
   section 4.4 of [PCLS].

   Figure 6.  Specific Compound Conditions with Specific Components

   Because the compound conditions/actions are specific to the Rule,
   They are auxiliary attachments to instances of the structural classes
   pcelsConditionAssociation or pcelsActionAssociation.  These
   structural classes represent the association between the rule and the
   compound condition/action.  The rule specific conditions/actions are
   therefore subordinated (DIT contained) to the rule entry.

   The conditions/actions are tied to the compound conditions/actions in
   the same way the compound conditions/actions are tied to rules.
   Association classes realize the association between the aggregating
   compound conditions/actions and the specific conditions/actions.

   This case is similar to the first one.  The conditions/actions are
   reusable and are therefore not attached to the association classes,

   association classes tie the conditions/actions in located in a

      Figure 9.  Reusable Compound Conditions with Reusable Components

   All the conditions/actions are reusable so they are stored in
   reusable containers.  The figure above illustrates two different
   reusable policy containers, but the number of containers in the
   system is decided based on administrative reasons.  The conditions,
   actions, etc. may be stored in the same or different containers with
   no impact on the policy definition semantics.

5.  Class Definitions

   The semantics for the policy information classes that are to be
   mapped directly from the information model to an LDAP representation
   are detailed in [PCIM_EXT].  Consequently, this document presents
   only a brief reference to those semantics.  The focus here is on the
   mapping from the information model (which is independent of
   repository type and access protocol) to a form that can be accessed
   using LDAP.  For various reasons including LDAP specific
   optimization, this mapping is not always 1:1.  Some new classes and
   attributes (that were not part of [PCIM] or [PCIM_EXT]) needed to be
   created in order to implement the LDAP mapping.  These new LDAP-only
   classes are fully defined in this document.

   The following notes apply to this section in its entirety.

   Note 1: The formal language for specifying the classes, attributes,
   and DIT structure and content rules is that defined in [LDAP_SYNTAX].
   In the following definitions, the class and attribute definitions
   follow [LDAP_SYNTAX] but they are line-wrapped to enhance human
   readability.

   Note 2: Even though not explicitly noted in the following class and
   attribute definitions, implementations may define DIT structure and
   content rules where applicable and supported by the underlying LDAP
   infrastructure.  In such cases, the DIT structure rule considerations
   discussed in section 5 of [PCLS] must be applied to PCELS
   implementations as well.  The reasons and details are presented in
   [X.501].

   Note 3: Wherever possible, an equality, a substrings and an ordering
   matching rule are defined for a particular attribute.  This provides
   additional implementation flexibility.  However, in some cases, the
   LDAP matching semantics may not cover all the application needs.  For
   instance, different values of pcelsIPv4AddrList may be semantically
   equivalent.  The equality matching rule, caseIgnoreMatch, associated

   to this attribute type is not suitable for detecting this
   equivalence.  Implementers should not rely solely on LDAP syntaxes
   and matching rules for being consistent with this specification.

   Note 4: The following attribute definitions use only LDAP matching
   rules and syntax definitions from [LDAP_SYNTAX], [LDAP_SCHEMA] and
   [LDAP_MATCH].  The corresponding X.500 matching rules are defined in
   [X.520].

   Note 5: Some of the following attribute types MUST conform to
   additional constraints on various data types (e.g., the only valid
   values for pcelsDecisionStrategy are 1 and 2).  Just like the
   attribute semantics, the definition of the value structures, valid
   ranges, etc. is covered by [PCIM_EXT] for the corresponding
   properties while such constraints are only briefly mentioned in this
   document.  In all cases, if a constraint is violated, the entry
   SHOULD be treated as invalid and the policy rules or groups that
   refer to it SHOULD be treated as being disabled, meaning that the
   execution of such policy rules or groups SHOULD be stopped.

   Note 6: Some of the object classes defined in this section cannot or
   should not be directly instantiated because they are either defined
   as abstract or do not implement stand-alone semantics (e.g.,
   pcelsValueAuxClass).  Regarding instances of objects that inherit
   from such classes, the text refers to "instances of <class_name>"
   when in fact the strictly correct expression would be "instances of
   objects that belong to non-abstract subclasses of <class_name>".  The
   omission is intentional; it makes the text easier to read.

5.1.  The Abstract Class pcelsPolicySet

   The pcelsPolicySet class represents a set of policies with a common
   decision strategy and a common set of policy roles.  This class
   together with the pcelsPolicySetAssociation class defined in a
   subsequent section of this document provide sufficient information to
   allow applications to apply appropriate ordering to a set of
   policies.  The pcelsPolicySet is mapped from the PolicySet class
   [PCIM_EXT].  The pcelsPolicySet class is an abstract object class and
   it is derived from the pcimPolicy class [PCLS].

   The pcelsPolicySetList attribute of a pcelsPolicySet instance
   references subordinated pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries.  The
   aggregated pcelsPolicySet instances are either attached to the
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries as auxiliary object classes or
   referenced by the pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries using the
   pcelsPolicySetDN attribute.

RFC 4104                         PCELS                         June 2005


   The pcelsPolicySet class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.1
     NAME 'pcelsPolicySet'
     DESC 'Set of policies'
     SUP pcimPolicy
     ABSTRACT
     MAY ( pcelsPolicySetName
         $ pcelsDecisionStrategy
         $ pcimRoles
         $ pcelsPolicySetList )
   )

   One of the attributes of the pcelsPolicySet class, pcimRoles is
   defined in the section 5.3 of [PCLS].  In the pcelsPolicySet class
   the pcimRole attribute preserves its syntax and semantics as defined
   by [PCLS] and [PCIM].

   The pcelsPolicySetName attribute type may be used as naming attribute
   for pcelsPolicySet entries.  This attribute type is of syntax
   Directory String [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching rule of
   caseIgnoreMatch, an ordering matching rule of caseIgnoreOrderingMatch
   and a substrings matching rule of caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
   [LDAP_SYNTAX].  Attributes of this type can only have a single value.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.1
     NAME 'pcelsPolicySetName'
     DESC 'User-friendly name of a policy set'
     EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
     ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch
     SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The pcelsDecisionStrategy attribute type indicates the evaluation
   method for the policies aggregated in the policy set.  It is mapped
   from the PolicySet.PolicyDecisionStrategy property [PCIM_EXT].  This
   attribute type is of syntax Integer [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an
   equality matching rule of integerMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX] and an ordering
   matching rule of integerOrderingMatch [LDAP_MATCH].  Attributes of
   this type can only have a single value.  The only allowed values for
   attributes of this type are 1 (FirstMatching) and 2 (AllMatching).
   If this attribute is missing from a pcelsPolicySet instance,
   applications MUST assume a FirstMatching decision strategy for the
   policy set.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.2
     NAME 'pcelsDecisionStrategy'
     DESC 'Evaluation method for the components of a pcelsPolicySet'
     EQUALITY integerMatch
     ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The pcelsPolicySetList attribute type is used in the realization of
   the PolicySetComponent association [PCIM_EXT].  This attribute type
   is of syntax DN [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching rule of
   distinguishedNameMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX].  Attributes of this type can
   have multiple values.  The only allowed values for pcelsPolicySetList
   attributes are DNs of pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries.  In a
   pcelsPolicySet, the pcelsPolicySetList attribute represents the
   associations between this policy set and its components.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.3
     NAME 'pcelsPolicySetList'
     DESC 'Unordered set of DNs of pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries'
     EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
   )

   Note: A pcelsPolicySet instance aggregates other pcelsPolicySet
   instances using pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries (defined in the
   next section).  Applications can sort the components of a
   pcelsPolicySet using attributes of the pcelsPolicySetAssociation
   entries.  However, implementations should not expect the LDAP data
   store to provide a useful ordering of the pcelsPolicySetList values
   in a pcelsPolicySet instance or to return sets of matching
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries in a meaningful order.  Instead,
   applications SHOULD implement their own means for post-retrieval
   ordering of policy rules/groups based on
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation.pcelsPriority values.

5.2.  The Structural Class pcelsPolicySetAssociation

   The pcelsPolicySetAssociation class is used to associate PolicySet
   instances [PCIM_EXT] to other entries.  pcelsPolicySetAssociation
   entries are always subordinated to the aggregating entry.  When
   subordinated to an instance of pcelsPolicySet,
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation realizes a PolicySetComponent association
   [PCIM_EXT].  When subordinated to an instance of dlm1System
   [CIM_LDAP], pcelsPolicySetAssociation realizes a PolicySetInSystem
   association [PCIM_EXT].

   The pcelsPolicySetAssociation class is a structural object class and
   it is derived from the pcimPolicy class [PCLS].

   The aggregation of a reusable pcelsPolicySet instance is realized via
   the pcelsPolicySetDN attribute.  A non-reusable pcelsPolicySet
   instance is attached (as auxiliary subclass of pcelsPolicySet)
   directly to the pcelsPolicySetAssociation entry.

   When reading a pcelsPolicySetAssociation instance that has a
   pcelsPolicySet attached, the attribute pcelsPolicySetDN MUST be
   ignored.  Applications SHOULD remove the pcelsPolicySetDN value from
   a pcelsPolicySetAssociation upon attachment of a pcelsPolicySet to
   the entry.

   The pcelsPolicySetAssociation class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.2
     NAME 'pcelsPolicySetAssociation'
     DESC 'Associates a policy set to an aggregating entry'
     SUP pcimPolicy
     STRUCTURAL
     MUST ( pcelsPriority )
     MAY ( pcelsPolicySetName
         $ pcelsPolicySetDN )
   )

   The pcelsPriority attribute type indicates the priority of a policy
   set component.  This attribute type is of syntax Integer
   [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching rule of integerMatch
   [LDAP_SYNTAX] and an ordering matching rule of integerOrderingMatch
   [LDAP_MATCH].  Attributes of this type can only have single values.
   The only allowed values for attributes of this type are non-negative
   integers.  Within the set of pcelsPolicySetAssociation entries
   directly subordinated to a pcelsPolicySet or a dlm1System [CIM_LDAP],
   the pcelsPriority values MUST be unique.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.4
     NAME 'pcelsPriority'
     DESC 'Priority of a component'
     EQUALITY integerMatch
     ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The pcelsPolicySetDN attribute type is used in the aggregation of
   PolicySet instances [PCIM_EXT].  This attribute type is of syntax DN
   [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching rule of
   distinguishedNameMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX].  Attributes of this type can
   only have single values.  The only allowed values for
   pcelsPolicySetDN attributes are DNs of pcelsPolicySet entries.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.5
     NAME 'pcelsPolicySetDN'
     DESC 'DN of a pcelsPolicySet entry'
     EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

5.3.  The Three Policy Group Classes

   The pcelsGroup class is the base class for representing a policy
   group.  It is mapped from the modified PolicyGroup class [PCIM_EXT].
   The pcelsGroup class is derived from the pcelsPolicySet class.  To
   maximize flexibility, the pcelsGroup class is defined as abstract.
   An auxiliary subclass pcelsGroupAuxClass enables the attachment of a
   policy group to an existing entry, while a structural subclass
   pcelsGroupInstance permits the representation of a policy group as a
   standalone entry.

   The pcelsGroup class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.3
     NAME 'pcelsGroup'
     DESC 'Base class for representing a policy group'
     SUP pcelsPolicySet
     ABSTRACT
     MAY ( pcimGroupName )
   )

RFC 4104                         PCELS                         June 2005


   The pcelsGroupAuxClass class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.4
     NAME 'pcelsGroupAuxClass'
     DESC 'Auxiliary class for representing a policy group'
     SUP pcelsGroup
     AUXILIARY
   )

   The pcelsGroupInstance class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.5
     NAME 'pcelsGroupInstance'
     DESC 'Structural class for representing a policy group'
     SUP pcelsGroup
     STRUCTURAL
   )

   The pcimGroupName attribute type used by the pcelsGroup class is
   defined in the section 5.2 of [PCLS].  In the pcelsGroup object
   class, this attribute preserves its syntax and semantics as defined
   by [PCLS] and [PCIM].

   Note: PCELS implementations SHOULD support pcelsGroup and its two
   subclasses and MAY also support pcimGroup and its two subclasses
   [PCLS].  Applications that choose to support pcelsGroup and its two
   subclasses MUST use the aggregation mechanism provided by
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation for aggregating policy groups or policy
   rules in policy groups represented as instances of pcelsGroup.

5.4.  The Three Policy Rule Classes

   The pcelsRule class is the base class for representing a policy rule.
   It is mapped from the modified PolicyRule class [PCIM_EXT].  The
   pcelsRule class is derived from the pcelsPolicySet class.  To
   maximize flexibility, the pcelsRule class is defined as abstract.  An
   auxiliary subclass pcelsRuleAuxClass enables the attachment of a
   policy rule to an existing entry, while a structural subclass
   pcelsRuleInstance permits the representation of a policy rule as a
   standalone entry.

   When reading a pcelsRule instance that has a pcimConditionAuxClass
   attached, from the policy rule perspective the attribute
   pcelsConditionList MUST be ignored.  For example, if present, the
   attribute MUST NOT be considered an association between this policy
   rule and a policy condition.  Such situations may occur, for example,
   when a pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass is attached to a pcelsRule
   instance.

   When reading a pcelsRule instance that has a pcimActionAuxClass
   attached, from the policy rule perspective the attribute
   pcelsActionList MUST be ignored.  For example, if present, the
   attribute MUST NOT be considered an association between this policy
   rule and a policy action.  Such situations may occur, for example,
   when a pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass is attached to a pcelsRule
   instance.

   The pcelsRule class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.6
     NAME 'pcelsRule'
     DESC 'Base class for representing a policy rule'
     SUP pcelsPolicySet
     ABSTRACT
     MAY ( pcimRuleName
         $ pcimRuleEnabled
         $ pcimRuleUsage
         $ pcimRuleMandatory

         $ pcelsConditionListType
         $ pcelsConditionList
         $ pcelsActionList
         $ pcelsSequencedActions
         $ pcelsExecutionStrategy )
   )

   The pcelsRuleAuxClass class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.7
     NAME 'pcelsRuleAuxClass'
     DESC 'Auxiliary class for representing a policy rule'
     SUP pcelsRule
     AUXILIARY
   )

   The pcelsRuleInstance class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.8
     NAME 'pcelsRuleInstance'
     DESC 'Structural class for representing a policy rule'
     SUP pcelsRule

   Four of the attributes used by the pcelsRule class are defined in the
   section 5.3 of [PCLS].  These attributes are: pcimRuleName,
   pcimRuleEnabled, pcimRuleUsage and pcimRuleMandatory.  In the
   pcelsRule object class, these attributes preserve their syntax and
   semantics as defined by [PCLS] and [PCIM].

   The attributes pcimRuleValidityPeriodList, pcimRuleConditionListType,
   pcimRuleConditionList, pcimRuleActionList and
   pcimRuleSequencedActions defined in [PCLS] are not used by pcelsRule.
   Instead, this class uses the new attributes
   pcelsRuleValidityPeriodList, pcelsConditionListType,
   pcelsConditionList, pcelsActionList and pcelsSequencedActions.
   Except for pcelsRuleValidityPeriodList, the new attributes are also
   used for similar purpose by either pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass or
   pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass.

   The pcelsRuleValidityPeriodList attribute type is used in the
   realization of the PolicyRuleValidityPeriod association ([PCIM_EXT]
   and [PCIM]).  This attribute type is of syntax DN [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It
   has an equality matching rule of distinguishedNameMatch
   [LDAP_SYNTAX].  Attributes of this type can have multiple values.
   The only allowed values for pcelsRuleValidityPeriodList attributes
   are DNs of pcimRuleValidityAssociation entries.  In a pcelsRule, the
   pcelsRuleValidityPeriodList attribute represents the associations
   between this policy rule and its time period conditions.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.62
     NAME 'pcelsRuleValidityPeriodList'
     DESC 'Unordered set of DNs of pcimRuleValidityAssociation entries'
     EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
   )

   The pcelsConditionListType attribute type indicates whether the set
   of aggregated conditions is in disjunctive or conjunctive normal
   form.  It is mapped from the PolicyRule.ConditionListType property
   [PCIM] (identical to the CompoundPolicyCondition.ConditionListType
   property defined in [PCIM_EXT]).  This attribute type is of syntax
   Integer [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching rule of
   integerMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX] and an ordering matching rule of
   integerOrderingMatch [LDAP_MATCH].  Attributes of this type can only
   have a single value.  The only allowed values for attributes of this
   type are 1 (Disjunctive) and 2 (Conjunctive).  If this attribute is
   missing from a pcelsRule instance, applications MUST assume that the
   set of aggregated conditions is in disjunctive normal form.

   Note 1: Rule validity periods for an instance of pcelsRule are
   realized using the attribute pcelsRuleValidityPeriodList and
   pcimRuleValidityAssociation [PCLS] entries subordinated to the rule.

   If DIT structure rules and name forms are written for a PCELS
   implementation (as suggested in section 5.5 of [PCLS]), they would
   require that an instance of the pcimRuleValidityAssociation class
   have as its superior an instance of the pcelsRule class or, if
   applicable, an instance of the pcimRule class.  Any structure rules
   and name forms that require an instance of the
   pcimRuleValidityAssociation class to have as its superior only an
   instance of the pcimRule class, are in conflict and MUST be removed.

   Note 2: PCELS implementations SHOULD support pcelsRule and its two
   subclasses and MAY also support pcimRule and its two subclasses
   [PCLS].  Applications that choose to support pcelsRule and its two
   subclasses MUST use the aggregation mechanism provided by
   pcelsPolicySetAssociation for aggregating policy groups or policy
   rules in policy rules represented as instances of pcelsRule.

5.5.  The Structural Class pcelsConditionAssociation

   The pcelsConditionAssociation class is used in the aggregation of
   PolicyCondition instances [PCIM].  pcelsConditionAssociation entries
   are always subordinated to the aggregating entry.  When subordinated
   to an instance of pcelsRule, the pcelsConditionAssociation entry
   realizes the PolicyConditionInPolicyRule association [PCIM_EXT].
   When subordinated to an instance of pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass,
   the pcelsConditionAssociation entry realizes the
   PolicyConditionInPolicyCondition association [PCIM_EXT].

   The pcelsConditionAssociation class is a structural object class and
   it is derived from the pcimRuleConditionAssociation class [PCLS].

   The aggregation of a reusable instance of pcimConditionAuxClass is
   realized via the pcimConditionDN attribute.  A non-reusable instance
   of pcimConditionAuxClass is attached directly to the
   pcelsConditionAssociation entry.

   When reading a pcelsConditionAssociation entry that has a
   pcimConditionAuxClass instance attached, the attribute
   pcimConditionDN MUST be ignored.  Applications SHOULD remove the
   pcimConditionDN value from a pcelsConditionAssociation upon
   attachment of a pcimConditionAuxClass to the entry.

5.7.  The Auxiliary Class pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass

   The pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass class implements a Value matching
   condition for a Variable.  It is mapped from the
   SimplePolicyCondition class [PCIM_EXT].  The
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass class is an auxiliary object class and
   it is derived from the pcimConditionAuxClass class [PCLS].

   A reusable variable/value is associated to a
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass via the pcelsVariableDN/pcelsValueDN
   reference from the simple condition instance.  A non-reusable
   variable/value is associated directly as auxiliary object class to
   the same entry as the pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass instance.

   When reading a pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass instance that has an
   instance of pcelsVariable attached, the attribute pcelsVariableDN
   MUST be ignored.  Applications SHOULD remove the pcelsVariableDN
   value from a pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass instance upon attachment of
   a pcelsVariable instance to the same entry.

   When reading a pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass instance that has an
   instance of pcelsValue attached, the attribute pcelsValueDN MUST be
   ignored.  Applications SHOULD remove the pcelsValueDN value from a
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass instance upon attachment of a pcelsValue
   instance to the same entry.

   The pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass class is defined as follows:

   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass, the pcelsVariableDN attribute
   represents the association between this simple policy condition and
   its policy variable.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   The pcelsValueDN attribute type realizes the
   PolicyValueInSimplePolicyCondition association [PCIM_EXT].  This
   attribute type is of syntax DN [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality
   matching rule of distinguishedNameMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX].  Attributes of
   this type can only have a single value.  The only allowed values for
   pcelsValueDN attributes are DNs of pcelsValueAuxClass entries.  In a
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass, the pcelsValueDN attribute represents
   the association between this simple policy condition and its policy
   value.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.12
     NAME 'pcelsValueDN'
     DESC 'DN of a pcelsValueAuxClass entry'
     EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch

   )

   Note: An instance of pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass and an instance of
   pcelsSimpleConditionAuxClass MUST NOT be attached to the same entry.
   Because the two classes use the same mechanisms to associate
   Variables and Values, this restriction is necessary in order to avoid
   ambiguities.

5.8.  The Auxiliary Class pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass

   The pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass class represents a compound policy
   condition formed by the aggregation of other policy conditions.  It
   is mapped from the CompoundPolicyCondition class [PCIM_EXT].  The
   pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass class is an auxiliary object class and
   it is derived from the pcimConditionAuxClass class [PCLS].

     SUP pcimConditionAuxClass
     AUXILIARY
     MAY ( pcelsConditionListType
         $ pcelsConditionList )
   )

      If the pcelsConditionListType attribute is missing from a
   pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass instance, applications MUST assume
   that the set of aggregated conditions is in disjunctive normal form.

   In a pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass instance, the pcelsConditionList
   attribute represents the associations between this compound policy
   condition and the compounded conditions.

   These attribute types are defined in section 5.4.

   Like pcelsRule, instances of pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass use
   pcelsConditionList values and subordinated pcelsConditionAssociation
   entries to aggregate policy conditions.

5.9.  The Auxiliary Class pcelsCompoundFilterConditionAuxClass

   The pcelsCompoundFilterConditionAuxClass class represents a domain-
   level filter.  It is mapped from the CompoundFilterCondition class
   [PCIM_EXT].  The pcelsCompoundFilterConditionAuxClass class is an
   auxiliary object class and it is derived from the
   pcelsCompoundConditionAuxClass class.

   The pcelsCompoundFilterConditionAuxClass class is defined as follows:

   The pcelsIsMirrored attribute type indicates whether the traffic that
   mirrors the specified filter is to be treated as matching the filter.
   It is mapped from the CompoundFilterCondition.IsMirrored property
   [PCIM_EXT].  This attribute type is of syntax Boolean [LDAP_SYNTAX].
   It has an equality matching rule of booleanMatch [LDAP_MATCH].

   Attributes of this type can only have a single value.  If this
   attribute is missing from a pcelsCompoundFilterConditionAuxClass
   instance, applications MUST assume that the filter is not mirrored.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

5.10.  The Auxiliary Class pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass

   The pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass class implements the action of
   assigning a Value to a Variable.  It is mapped from the
   SimplePolicyAction class [PCIM_EXT].  The pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass
   class is an auxiliary object class and it is derived from the
   pcimActionAuxClass class [PCLS].

   A reusable variable/value is associated to a
   pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass via the pcelsVariableDN/pcelsValueDN
   reference from the simple action instance.  A non-reusable
   variable/value is associated directly as auxiliary object class to
   the same entry as the pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass instance.

   When reading a pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass instance that has an
   instance of pcelsVariable attached, the attribute pcelsVariableDN
   MUST be ignored.  Applications SHOULD remove the pcelsVariableDN
   value from a pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass instance upon attachment of a
   pcelsVariable instance to the same entry.

   When reading a pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass instance that has an
   instance of pcelsValue attached, the attribute pcelsValueDN MUST be

   In a pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass, the pcelsVariableDN attribute
   represents the association between this simple policy action and its
   policy variable.  It realizes the PolicyVariableInSimplePolicyAction
   association [PCIM_EXT].

   In a pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass, the pcelsValueDN attribute represents
   the association between this simple policy action and its policy
   value.  It realizes the PolicyValueInSimplePolicyAction association
   [PCIM_EXT].

   These attributes are defined in section 5.7.

   Note: An instance of pcelsSimpleActionAuxClass and an instance of

   If the pcelsExecutionStrategy attribute is missing from a
   pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass instance, applications MUST assume that
   all the actions are to be executed (Do all).

   These attribute types are defined in section 5.4.

   Like pcelsRule, instances of pcelsCompoundActionAuxClass use

5.14.  The Auxiliary Class pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass

   The pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass class is mapped from the
   PolicyImplicitVariable class [PCIM_EXT].  The
   pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass is an auxiliary object class and it is
   derived from the pcelsVariable class.

   The pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass class does not represent actual
   variables; these are introduced by its subclasses.
   pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass introduces the semantics of being an
   implicitly defined policy variable and these semantics are inherited
   by all its subclasses.  These semantics include those inherited from
   pcelsVariable that possibly represent either rule-specific or
   reusable policy variables.

   In order to preserve the ability to represent rule-specific or
   reusable variables, all the subclasses of
   pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass MUST also be auxiliary classes.

   The pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.18
     NAME 'pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass'
     DESC 'Implicitly defined policy variable'
     SUP pcelsVariable
     AUXILIARY
     MAY ( pcelsExpectedValueTypes )
   )

   The pcelsExpectedValueTypes attribute type represents the set of
   policy value types that may be used with this policy variable.  It is
   mapped from the PolicyImplicitVariable.ValueTypes property
   [PCIM_EXT].  This attribute type is of syntax Directory String
   [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching rule of caseIgnoreMatch
   [LDAP_SYNTAX].  Attributes of this type can have multiple values.

5.15.  The Subclasses of pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass

   The following classes are derived from the
   pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass class.  They are mapped from the
   corresponding subclasses of the PolicyImplicitVariable class
   [PCIM_EXT].  All the classes defined below are auxiliary object
   classes.

   Each one of the classes defined in this section introduces specific
   restrictions for the values of the pcelsExpectedValueTypes attribute.
   If this attribute is missing, applications MUST assume that all
   allowed value types are expected for the policy variable.

   Some of these classes have additional restrictions on the actual
   values of the associated policy value instances (e.g., only integers
   in the range 0..65535 must be used with a SourcePort variable).  The
   association between a pcelsImplicitVariableAuxClass instance and a
   pcelsValueAuxClass instance that contains values outside the valid
   range or set for that variable SHOULD be considered invalid.  The
   entry that realizes such association SHOULD be treated as invalid and
   the policy rules or groups that refer to it SHOULD be treated as
   being disabled, meaning that the execution of such policy rules or
   groups SHOULD be stopped.

5.18.  The Three Reusable Policy Container Classes

   The pcelsReusableContainer class represents a container of reusable

   pcimRepository class [PCLS].  To maximize flexibility, the
   pcelsReusableContainer class is defined as abstract.  An auxiliary
   subclass pcelsReusableContainerAuxClass enables the attachment of a
   reusable policy container to an existing entry, while a structural
   subclass pcelsReusableContainerInstance permits the representation of
   a reusable policy container as a standalone entry.

   The elements contained in a reusable policy container are aggregated
   via subordination to a pcelsReusableContainer instance (DIT
   containment).  A reusable policy container can include the elements
   of another reusable policy container by aggregating the container
   itself.  This is realized by DIT containment when the policy
   containers are subordinated to one another, or by reference when the

   Applications MUST assume 'all values' for optional (MAY) attributes
   not present in a pcelsIPHeadersFilter entry.

   [PCIM_EXT] defines several constraints for the IpHeadersFilter class
   and its properties.  All these constraints (even those that, for
   brevity, are not reiterated in this document) apply to the
   pcelsIPHeadersFilter class and its attributes.  A
   pcelsIPHeadersFilter entry that violates any of these constraints
   SHOULD be treated as invalid and the policy rules or groups
   associated to this entry SHOULD be treated as being disabled, meaning
   that the execution of such policy rules or groups SHOULD be stopped.

   The pcelsIPHdrVersion attribute type indicates the version of the IP
   addresses to be filtered on.  It is mapped from the
   IpHeadersFilter.HdrIpVersion property [PCIM_EXT].  This attribute
   type is of syntax Integer [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching
   rule of integerMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX] and an ordering matching rule of
   integerOrderingMatch [LDAP_MATCH].  Attributes of this type can only
   have a single value.  The only allowed values for attributes of this
   type are 4 and 6.

   In a pcelsIPHeadersFilter entry, the pcelsIPHdrVersion attribute type
   determines the size for the IP version dependent attribute values.
   These attributes are: pcelsIPHdrSourceAddress,
   pcelsIPHdrSourceAddressEndOfRange, pcelsIPHdrSourceMask,
   pcelsIPHdrDestAddress, pcelsIPHdrDestAddressEndOfRange and
   pcelsIPHdrDestMask.  Their valid values are as follows:
      for IPv4: OctetStrings with a size of 4
      for IPv6: OctetStrings with a size of 16 or 20

   If the pcelsIPHdrVersion attribute is missing from a
   pcelsFilterEntryBase instance, then the filter does not consider IP
   version in selecting matching packets.  In this case, the IP version
   dependent attributes (listed above) must not be present in the filter
   entry.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

5.22.  The Structural Class pcels8021Filter

   The pcels8021Filter class provides 802.1 attributes for performing
   filtering on 802.1 headers.  It is mapped from the 8021Filter class
   [PCIM_EXT].  The pcels8021Filter class is a structural object class
   and it is derived from the pcelsFilterEntryBase class.

   The pcels8021Filter class is defined as follows:

         $ pcels8021HdrProtocolID
         $ pcels8021HdrPriority
         $ pcels8021HdrVLANID )
   )

   Applications MUST assume 'all values' for optional (MAY) attributes
   not present in a pcels8021Filter entry.

   [PCIM_EXT] defines several constraints for the 8021Filter class and
   its properties.  All these constraints (even those that, for brevity,
   are not reiterated in this document) apply to the pcels8021Filter
   class and its attributes.  A pcels8021Filter entry that violates any
   of these constraints SHOULD be treated as invalid and the policy
   rules or groups associated to this entry SHOULD be treated as being
   disabled, meaning that the execution of such policy rules or groups
   SHOULD be stopped.

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.56
     NAME 'pcelsFilterDirection'
     DESC 'Direction to which this filter is applied'
     EQUALITY integerMatch
     ORDERING integerOrderingMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27
     SINGLE-VALUE
   )

   The pcelsFilterEntryList attribute type realizes the
   EntriesInFilterList association [PCIM_EXT].  This attribute type is
   of syntax DN [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has an equality matching rule of
   distinguishedNameMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX].  Attributes of this type can
   have multiple values.  The only allowed values for
   pcelsFilterEntryList attributes are DNs of pcelsFilterEntryBase
   entries.  In a pcelsFilterListAuxClass, the pcelsFilterEntryList
   attribute represents the associations between this filter collection
   and its components.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.57
     NAME 'pcelsFilterEntryList'
     DESC 'Unordered set of DNs of pcelsFilterEntryBase entries'
     EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
     SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
   )

   The EntrySequence property of the association EntriesInFilterList is
   restricted to a single value ('0') [PCIM_EXT] which makes it
   redundant.  Therefore, its mapping to an LDAP schema element is
   unnecessary.

5.24.  The Auxiliary Class pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass

   The pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass class provides a general extension
   mechanism for representing policy variables that have not been
   specifically modeled.  Instead, its two properties are used to define
   the content and format of the variable, as explained below.  This
   class is intended for vendor-specific extensions that are not
   amenable to using pcelsVariable; standardized extensions SHOULD NOT
   use this class.

   The pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass class is an auxiliary object class
   and it is derived from the pcelsVariable class.

   The pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass class is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.1.56
     NAME 'pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass'
     DESC 'Defines registered means to describe a policy variable'
     SUP pcelsVariable
     AUXILIARY
     MAY ( pcelsVendorVariableData $
           pcelsVendorVariableEncoding )
   )

   The pcelsVendorVariableData attribute provides a general mechanism
   for representing policy variables that have not been specifically
   modeled.  This attribute type is of syntax OctetString [LDAP_SYNTAX].
   It has an equality matching rule of octetStringMatch [LDAP_SCHEMA]
   and an ordering matching rule of octetStringOrderingMatch
   [LDAP_MATCH].  Attributes of this type can have multiple values.  In
   pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass instances, the format of the values for
   attributes of this type is identified by the OID stored in the
   pcelsVendorVariableEncoding attribute.

   This attribute type is defined as follows:

   ( 1.3.6.1.1.9.2.58
     NAME 'pcelsVendorVariableData'

   The pcelsVendorVariableEncoding attribute identifies the format for
   representing policy variables that have not been specifically
   modeled.  This attribute type is of syntax OID [LDAP_SYNTAX].  It has

   an equality matching rule of objectIdentifierMatch [LDAP_SYNTAX].
   Attributes of this type can only have a single value.  In
   pcelsVendorVariableAuxClass instances, the
   pcelsVendorVariableEncoding attribute is used to identify the format

5.25.  The Auxiliary Class pcelsVendorValueAuxClass

   The pcelsVendorValueAuxClass class provides a general extension
   mechanism for representing policy values that have not been
   specifically modeled.  Instead, its two properties are used to define
   the content and format of the policy value, as explained below.  This
   class is intended for vendor-specific extensions that are not
   amenable to using pcelsValueAuxClass; standardized extensions SHOULD
   NOT use this class.

   The pcelsVendorValueAuxClass class is an auxiliary object class and
   it is derived from the pcelsValueAuxClass class.

   The pcelsVendorValueAuxClass class is defined as follows:
