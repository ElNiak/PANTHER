          An Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Control Package
                for the Media Control Channel Framework

Abstract

   This document defines a Media Control Channel Framework Package for
   Interactive Voice Response (IVR) dialog interaction on media
   connections and conferences.  The package defines dialog management
   request elements for preparing, starting, and terminating dialog
   interactions, as well as associated responses and notifications.
   Dialog interactions are specified in a dialog language.  This package
   defines a lightweight IVR dialog language (supporting prompt
   playback, runtime controls, Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF)
   collection, and media recording) and allows other dialog languages to
   be used.  The package also defines elements for auditing package
   capabilities and IVR dialogs.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


1.  Introduction

   The Media Control Channel Framework [RFC6230] provides a generic
   approach for establishment and reporting capabilities of remotely
   initiated commands.  The Channel Framework -- an equivalent term for
   the Media Control Channel Framework -- utilizes many functions
   provided by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] for the
   rendezvous and establishment of a reliable channel for control
   interactions.  The Control Framework also introduces the concept of a
   Control Package.  A Control Package is an explicit usage of the
   Control Framework for a particular interaction set.  This document
   defines a Control Package for Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
   dialogs on media connections and conferences.  The term 'dialog' in
   this document refers to an IVR dialog and is completely unrelated to
   the notion of a SIP dialog.  The term 'IVR' is used in its inclusive
   sense, allowing media other than voice for dialog interaction.

   The package defines dialog management request elements for preparing,
   starting, and terminating dialog interactions, as well as associated
   responses and notifications.  Dialog interactions are specified using
   a dialog language where the language specifies a well-defined syntax
   and semantics for permitted operations (play a prompt, record input
   from the user, etc.).  This package defines a lightweight IVR dialog
   language (supporting prompt playback, runtime controls, DTMF
   collection, and media recording) and allows other dialog languages to
   be used.  These dialog languages are specified inside dialog
   management elements for preparing and starting dialog interactions.
   The package also defines elements for auditing package capabilities
   and IVR dialogs.

   This package has been designed to satisfy IVR requirements documented
   in "Media Server Control Protocol Requirements" [RFC5167] -- more
   specifically, REQ-MCP-28, REQ-MCP-29, and REQ-MCP-30.  It achieves
   this by building upon two major approaches to IVR dialog design.
   These approaches address a wide range of IVR use cases and are used
   in many applications that are extensively deployed today.

   First, the package is designed to provide the major IVR functionality
   of SIP media server languages such as netann [RFC4240], Media Server
   Control Markup Language (MSCML) [RFC5022], and Media Server Markup
   Language (MSML) [RFC5707], which themselves build upon more
   traditional non-SIP languages ([H.248.9], [RFC2897]).  A key
   differentiator is that this package provides IVR functionality using
   the Channel Framework.

   Second, its design is aligned with key concepts of the web model as
   defined in W3C Voice Browser languages.  The key dialog management
   mechanism is closely aligned with Call Control XML (CCXML) [CCXML10].



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The dialog functionality defined in this package can be largely seen
   as a subset of VoiceXML ([VXML20], [VXML21]): where possible, basic
   prompting, DTMF collection, and media recording features are
   incorporated, but not any advanced VoiceXML constructs (such as
   <form>, its interpretation algorithm, or a dynamic data model).  As
   W3C develops VoiceXML 3.0 [VXML30], we expect to see further
   alignment, especially in providing a set of basic independent
   primitive elements (such as prompt, collect, record, and runtime
   controls) that can be reused in different dialog languages.

   By reusing and building upon design patterns from these approaches to
   IVR languages, this package is intended to provide a foundation that
   is familiar to current IVR developers and sufficient for most IVR
   applications, as well as a path to other languages that address more
   advanced applications.

   This Control Package defines a lightweight IVR dialog language.  The
   scope of this dialog language is the following IVR functionality:

   o  playing one or more media resources as a prompt to the user

   o  runtime controls (including VCR controls like speed and volume)

   o  collecting DTMF input from the user according to a grammar

   o  recording user media input

   Out of scope for this dialog language are more advanced functions
   including ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), TTS (Text-to-Speech),
   fax, automatic prompt recovery ('media fallback'), and media
   transformation.  Such functionality can be addressed by other dialog
   languages (such as VoiceXML) used with this package, extensions to
   this package (addition of foreign elements or attributes from another
   namespace), or other Control Packages.

   The functionality of this package is defined by messages, containing
   XML [XML] elements, transported using the Media Control Channel
   Framework.  The XML elements can be divided into three types: dialog
   management elements; a dialog element that defines a lightweight IVR
   dialog language used with dialog management elements; and finally,
   elements for auditing package capabilities as well as dialogs managed
   by the package.

   Dialog management elements are designed to manage the general
   lifecycle of a dialog.  Elements are provided for preparing a dialog,
   starting the dialog on a conference or connection, and terminating
   execution of a dialog.  Each of these elements is contained in a
   Media Control Channel Framework CONTROL message sent to the media

   server.  When the appropriate action has been executed, the media
   server sends a REPORT message (or a 200 response to the CONTROL
   message if it can execute in time) with a response element indicating
   whether or not the operation was successful (e.g., if the dialog
   cannot be started, then the error is reported in this response).
   Once a dialog has been successfully started, the media server can
   send further event notifications in a framework CONTROL message.
   This package defines two event notifications: a DTMF event indicating
   the DTMF activity, and a dialogexit event indicating that the dialog
   has exited.  If the dialog has executed successfully, the dialogexit
   event includes information collected during the dialog.  If an error
   occurs during execution (e.g., a media resource failed to play, no
   recording resource available, etc.), then error information is
   reported in the dialogexit event.  Once a dialogexit event is sent,
   the dialog lifecycle is terminated.

   The dialog management elements for preparing and starting a dialog
   specify the dialog using a dialog language.  A dialog language has
   well-defined syntax and semantics for defined dialog operations.
   Typically, dialog languages are written in XML where the root element
   has a designated XML namespace and, when used as standalone
   documents, have an associated MIME media type.  For example, VoiceXML
   is an XML dialog language with the root element <vxml> with the
   designated namespace 'http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml' and standalone
   documents are associated with the MIME media type 'application/
   voicexml+xml' [RFC4267].

   This Control Package defines its own lightweight IVR dialog language.
   The language has a root element (<dialog>) with the same designated
   namespace as used for other elements defined in this package (see
   Section 8.2).  The root element contains child elements for playing
   prompts to the user, specifying runtime controls, collecting DTMF
   input from the user, and recording media input from the user.  The
   child elements can co-occur so as to provide 'play announcement',
   'prompt and collect', as well as 'prompt and record' functionality.

   The dialog management elements for preparing and starting a dialog
   can specify the dialog language either by including inline a fragment
   with the root element or by referencing an external dialog document.
   The dialog language defined in this package is specified inline.
   Other dialog languages, such as VoiceXML, can be used by referencing
   an external dialog document.

   The document is organized as follows.  Section 3 describes how this
   Control Package fulfills the requirements for a Media Control Channel
   Framework Control Package.  Section 4 describes the syntax and
   semantics of defined elements, including dialog management
   (Section 4.2), the IVR dialog element (Section 4.3), and audit

   elements (Section 4.4).  Section 5 describes an XML schema for these
   elements and provides extensibility by allowing attributes and
   elements from other namespaces.  Section 6 provides examples of
   package usage.  Section 7 describes important security considerations
   for use of this Control Package.  Section 8 provides information on
   IANA registration of this Control Package, including its name, XML
   namespace, and MIME media type.  It also establishes a registry for
   prompt variables.  Finally, Section 9 provides additional information
   on using VoiceXML when supported as an external dialog language.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14 [RFC2119] defines the key words "MUST",
   "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL".  In
   addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   The following additional terms are defined for use in this document:

   Dialog:  A dialog performs media interaction with a user following
      the concept of an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) dialog (this
      sense of 'dialog' is completely unrelated to a SIP dialog).  A
      dialog is specified as inline XML or via a URI reference to an
      external dialog document.  Traditional IVR dialogs typically
      feature capabilities such as playing audio prompts, collecting
      DTMF input, and recording audio input from the user.  More
      inclusive definitions include support for other media types,
      runtime controls, synthesized speech, recording and playback of
      video, recognition of spoken input, and mixed initiative
      conversations.

   Application Server:  A SIP [RFC3261] application server (AS) hosts
      and executes services such as interactive media and conferencing
      in an operator's network.  An AS influences and impacts the SIP
      session, in particular by terminating SIP sessions on a media
      server, which is under its control.

   Media Server:  A media server (MS) processes media streams on behalf
      of an AS by offering functionality such as interactive media,
      conferencing, and transcoding to the end user.  Interactive media
      functionality is realized by way of dialogs that are initiated by
      the application server.

3.  Control Package Definition

   This section fulfills the mandatory requirement for information that
   MUST be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
   Package, as detailed in Section 7 of [RFC6230].

3.1.  Control Package Name

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package to specify and
   register a unique name.

   The name of this Control Package is "msc-ivr/1.0" (Media Server
   Control - Interactive Voice Response - version 1.0).  Its IANA
   registration is specified in Section 8.1.

   Since this is the initial ("1.0") version of the Control Package,
   there are no backwards-compatibility issues to address.

3.2.  Framework Message Usage

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package to explicitly detail
   the CONTROL messages that can be used as well as provide an
   indication of directionality between entities.  This will include
   which role type is allowed to initiate a request type.

   This package specifies Control and response messages in terms of XML
   elements defined in Section 4, where the message bodies have the MIME
   media type defined in Section 8.4.  These elements describe requests,
   responses, and notifications and all are contained within a root
   <mscivr> element (Section 4.1).

   In this package, the MS operates as a Control Server in receiving
   requests from, and sending responses to, the AS (operating as Control
   Client).  Dialog management requests and responses are defined in
   Section 4.2.  Audit requests and responses are defined in
   Section 4.4.  Dialog management and audit responses are carried in a
   framework 200 response or REPORT message bodies.  This package's
   response codes are defined in Section 4.5.

   Note that package responses are different from framework response
   codes.  Framework error response codes (see Section 7 of [RFC6230])
   are used when the request or event notification is invalid; for
   example, a request is invalid XML (400), or not understood (500).

   The MS also operates as a Control Client in sending event
   notification to the AS (Control Server).  Event notifications
   (Section 4.2.5) are carried in CONTROL message bodies.  The AS MUST
   respond with a Control Framework 200 response.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


3.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

   This package requires that the XML schema in Section A.1 of [RFC6230]
   MUST be supported for media dialogs and conferences.

   The package uses "connectionid" and "conferenceid" attributes for
   various element definitions (Section 4).  The XML schema (Section 5)
   imports the definitions of these attributes from the framework
   schema.

3.4.  CONTROL Message Body

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package to define the
   control body that can be contained within a CONTROL command request
   and to indicate the location of detailed syntax definitions and
   semantics for the appropriate body types.

   When operating as Control Server, the MS receives Control message
   bodies with the MIME media type defined in Section 8.4 and containing
   an <mscivr> element (Section 4.1) with either a dialog management or
   audit request child element.

   The following dialog management request elements are carried in
   CONTROL message bodies to the MS: <dialogprepare> (Section 4.2.1),
   <dialogstart> (Section 4.2.2), and <dialogterminate> (Section 4.2.3)
   elements.

   The <audit> request element (Section 4.4.1) is also carried in
   CONTROL message bodies.

   When operating as Control Client, the MS sends CONTROL messages with
   the MIME media type defined in Section 8.4 and a body containing an
   <mscivr> element (Section 4.1) with a notification <event> child
   element (Section 4.2.5).

3.5.  REPORT Message Body

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to define
   the REPORT body that can be contained within a REPORT command
   request, or that no report package body is required.  This section
   indicates the location of detailed syntax definitions and semantics
   for the appropriate body types.





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 10]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   When operating as Control Server, the MS sends REPORT bodies with the
   MIME media type defined in Section 8.4 and containing a <mscivr>
   element (Section 4.1) with a response child element.  The response
   element for dialog management requests is a <response> element
   (Section 4.2.4).  The response element for an audit request is an
   <auditresponse> element (Section 4.4.2).

3.6.  Audit

   The Control Framework encourages Control Packages to specify whether
   auditing is available, how it is triggered, as well as the query/
   response formats.

   This Control Package supports auditing of package capabilities and
   dialogs on the MS.  An audit request is carried in a CONTROL message
   (see Section 3.4) and an audit response in a REPORT message (or a 200
   response to the CONTROL if it can execute the audit in time) (see
   Section 3.5).

   The syntax and semantics of audit request and response elements are
   defined in Section 4.4.

3.7.  Examples

   The Control Framework recommends Control Packages to provide a range
   of message flows that represent common flows using the package and
   this framework document.

   This Control Package provides examples of such message flows in
   Section 6.

4.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML elements for this package.  The elements
   are defined in the XML namespace specified in Section 8.2.

   The root element is <mscivr> (Section 4.1).  All other XML elements
   (requests, responses, and notification elements) are contained within
   it.  Child elements describe dialog management (Section 4.2) and
   audit (Section 4.4) functionality.  The IVR dialog element (contained
   within dialog management elements) is defined in Section 4.3.
   Response status codes are defined in Section 4.5 and type definitions
   in Section 4.6.

   Implementation of this Control Package MUST address the Security
   Considerations described in Section 7.





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 11]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   Implementation of this Control Package MUST adhere to the syntax and
   semantics of XML elements defined in this section and the schema
   (Section 5).  Since XML schema is unable to support some types of
   syntactic constraints (such as attribute and element co-occurrence),
   some elements in this package specify additional syntactic
   constraints in their textual definition.  If there is a difference in
   constraints between the XML schema and the textual description of
   elements in this section, the textual definition takes priority.

   The XML schema supports extensibility by allowing attributes and
   elements from other namespaces.  Implementations MAY support
   additional capabilities by means of attributes and elements from
   other (foreign) namespaces.  Attributes and elements from foreign
   namespaces are not described in this section.

   Some elements in this Control Package contain attributes whose value
   is a URI.  These elements include: <dialogprepare> (Section 4.2.1),
   <dialogstart> (Section 4.2.2), <media> (Section 4.3.1.5), <grammar>
   (Section 4.3.1.3.1), and <record> (Section 4.3.1.4).  The MS MUST
   support both HTTP [RFC2616] and HTTPS [RFC2818] protocol schemes for
   fetching and uploading resources, and the MS MAY support other
   schemes.  The implementation SHOULD support storage of authentication
   information as part of its configuration, including security
   certificates for use with HTTPS.  If the implementation wants to
   support user authentication, user certifications and passwords can
   also be stored as part of its configuration or the implementation can
   extend the schema (adding, for example, an http-password attribute in
   its own namespace) and then map user authentication information onto
   the appropriate headers following the HTTP authentication model
   [RFC2616].

   Some elements in this Control Package contain attributes whose value
   is descriptive text primarily for diagnostic use.  The implementation
   can indicate the language used in the descriptive text by means of a
   'desclang' attribute ([RFC2277], [RFC5646]).  The desclang attribute
   can appear on the root element as well as selected subordinate
   elements (see Section 4.1).  The desclang attribute value on the root
   element applies to all desclang attributes in subordinate elements
   unless the subordinate element has an explicit desclang attribute
   that overrides it.

   Usage examples are provided in Section 6.

4.1.  <mscivr>

   The <mscivr> element has the following attributes (in addition to
   standard XML namespace attributes such as xmlns):




McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 12]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   version:  a string specifying the mscivr package version.  The value
      is fixed as '1.0' for this version of the package.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

   desclang:  specifies the language used in descriptive text attributes
      of subordinate elements (unless the subordinate element provides a
      desclang attribute that overrides the value for its descriptive
      text attributes).  The descriptive text attributes on subordinate
      elements include: the reason attribute on <response>
      (Section 4.2.4), <dialogexit> (Section 4.2.5.1), and
      <auditresponse> (Section 4.4.2); desc attribute on <variabletype>
      and <format> (Section 4.4.2.2.5.1).  A valid value is a language
      identifier (Section 4.6.11).  The attribute is optional.  The
      default value is i-default (BCP 47 [RFC5646]).

   The <mscivr> element has the following defined child elements, only
   one of which can occur:

   1.  dialog management elements defined in Section 4.2:

       <dialogprepare>  prepare a dialog.  See Section 4.2.1.

       <dialogstart>  start a dialog.  See Section 4.2.2.

       <dialogterminate>  terminate a dialog.  See Section 4.2.3.

       <response>  response to a dialog request.  See Section 4.2.4.

       <event>  dialog or subscription notification.  See Section 4.2.5.

   2.  audit elements defined in Section 4.4:

       <audit>  audit package capabilities and managed dialogs.  See
          Section 4.4.1.

       <auditresponse>  response to an audit request.  See
          Section 4.4.2.

   For example, a request to the MS to start an IVR dialog playing a
   prompt:











McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 13]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="ssd3r3:sds345b">
     <dialog>
      <prompt>
       <media loc="http://www.example.com/welcome.wav"/>
      </prompt>
     </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   and a response from the MS that the dialog started successfully:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <response status="200" dialogid="d1"/>
   </mscivr>

   and finally a notification from the MS indicating that the dialog
   exited upon completion of playing the prompt:

  <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr"
          desclang="en">
   <event dialogid="d1">
    <dialogexit status="1" reason="successful completion of the dialog">
     <promptinfo termmode="completed"/>
    </dialogexit>
   </event>
  </mscivr>

   The language of the descriptive text in the reason attribute of
   <dialogexit> is explicitly indicated by the desclang attribute of the
   <mscivr> root element.

4.2.  Dialog Management Elements

   This section defines the dialog management XML elements for this
   Control Package.  These elements are divided into requests,
   responses, and notifications.

   Request elements are sent to the MS to request a specific dialog
   operation to be executed.  The following request elements are
   defined:

   <dialogprepare>:  prepare a dialog for later execution

   <dialogstart>:  start a (prepared) dialog on a connection or
      conference

   <dialogterminate>:  terminate a dialog



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 14]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   Responses from the MS describe the status of the requested operation.
   Responses are specified in a <response> element (Section 4.2.4) that
   includes a mandatory attribute describing the status in terms of a
   numeric code.  Response status codes are defined in Section 4.5.  The
   MS MUST respond to a request message with a response message.  If the
   MS is not able to process the request and carry out the dialog
   operation, the request has failed and the MS MUST indicate the class
   of failure using an appropriate 4xx response code.  Unless an error
   response code is specified for a class of error within this section,
   implementations follow Section 4.5 in determining the appropriate
   status code for the response.

   Notifications are sent from the MS to provide updates on the status
   of a dialog or operations defined within the dialog.  Notifications
   are specified in an <event> element (Section 4.2.5).

                        Figure 1: Dialog Lifecycle

   The MS implementation MUST adhere to the dialog lifecycle shown in
   Figure 1, where each dialog has the following states:

   IDLE:  the dialog is uninitialized.

   PREPARING:  the dialog is being prepared.  The dialog is assigned a
      valid dialog identifier (see below).  If an error occurs, the
      dialog transitions to the TERMINATED state and the MS MUST send a
      response indicating the error.  If the dialog is terminated before
      preparation is complete, the dialog transitions to the TERMINATED
      state and the MS MUST send a 410 response (Section 4.5) for the
      prepare request.

   PREPARED:  the dialog has been successfully prepared and the MS MUST
      send a 200 response indicating the prepare operation was
      successful.  If the dialog is terminated, then the MS MUST send a
      200 response, the dialog transitions to the TERMINATED state and
      the MS MUST send a dialogexit notification event (see
      Section 4.2.5.1).  If the duration the dialog remains in the
      PREPARED state exceeds the maximum preparation duration, the
      dialog transitions to the TERMINATED state and the MS MUST send a
      dialogexit notification with the appropriate error status code
      (see Section 4.2.5.1).  A maximum preparation duration of 300s is
      RECOMMENDED.

   STARTING:  the dialog is being started.  If the dialog has not
      already been prepared, it is first prepared and assigned a valid
      dialog identifier (see below).  If an error occurs the dialog
      transitions to the TERMINATED state and the MS MUST send a
      response indicating the error.  If the dialog is terminated, the
      dialog transitions to the TERMINATED state and the MS MUST send a
      410 response (Section 4.5) for the start request.

   STARTED:  the dialog has been successfully started and is now active.
      The MS MUST send a 200 response indicating the start operation was
      successful.  If any dialog events occur that were subscribed to,
      the MS MUST send a notifications when the dialog event occurs.
      When the dialog exits (due to normal termination, an error, or a
      terminate request), the MS MUST send a dialogexit notification
      event (see Section 4.2.5.1) and the dialog transitions to the
      TERMINATED state.

   TERMINATED:  the dialog is terminated and its dialog identifier is no
      longer valid.  Dialog notifications MUST NOT be sent for this
      dialog.

   Each dialog has a valid identifier until it transitions to a
   TERMINATED state.  The dialog identifier is assigned by the MS unless
   the <dialogprepare> or <dialogstart> request already specifies a

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   identifier (dialogid) that is not associated with any other dialog on
   the MS.  Once a dialog is in a TERMINATED state, its dialog
   identifier is no longer valid and can be reused for another dialog.

   The identifier is used to reference the dialog in subsequent
   requests, responses, and notifications.  In a <dialogstart> request,
   the dialog identifier can be specified in the prepareddialogid
   attribute indicating the prepared dialog to start.  In
   <dialogterminate> and <audit> requests, the dialog identifier is
   specified in the dialogid attribute, indicating which dialog is to be
   terminated or audited, respectively.  If these requests specify a
   dialog identifier already associated with another dialog on the MS,
   the MS sends a response with a 405 status code (see Section 4.5) and
   the same dialogid as in the request.  The MS MUST specify a dialog
   identifier in notifications associated with the dialog.  The MS MUST
   specify a dialog identifier in responses unless it is a response to a
   syntactically invalid request.

   For a given dialog, the <dialogprepare> or <dialogstart> request
   elements specify the dialog content to execute either by including
   inline a <dialog> element (the dialog language defined in this
   package; see Section 4.3) or by referencing an external dialog
   document (a dialog language defined outside this package).  When
   referencing an external dialog document, the request element contains
   a URI reference to the remote document (specifying the dialog
   definition) and, optionally, a type attribute indicating the MIME
   media type associated with the dialog document.  Consequently, the
   dialog language associated with a dialog on the MS is identified
   either inline by a <dialog> child element or by a src attribute
   referencing a document containing the dialog language.  The MS MUST
   support inline the IVR dialog language defined in Section 4.3.  The
   MS MAY support other dialog languages by reference.

4.2.1.  <dialogprepare>

   The <dialogprepare> request is sent to the MS to request preparation
   of a dialog.  Dialog preparation consists of (a) retrieving an
   external dialog document and/or external resources referenced within
   an inline <dialog> element and (b) validating the dialog document
   syntactically and semantically.

   A prepared dialog is executed when the MS receives a <dialogstart>
   request referencing the prepared dialog identifier (see
   Section 4.2.2).

   The <dialogprepare> element has the following attributes:





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 18]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   src:  specifies the location of an external dialog document to
      prepare.  A valid value is a URI (see Section 4.6.9).  The MS MUST
      support both HTTP [RFC2616] and HTTPS [RFC2818] schemes and the MS
      MAY support other schemes.  If the URI scheme is unsupported, the
      MS sends a <response> with a 420 status code (Section 4.5).  If
      the document cannot be retrieved within the timeout interval, the
      MS sends a <response> with a 409 status code.  If the document
      contains a type of dialog language that the MS does not support,
      the MS sends a <response> with a 421 status code.  The attribute
      is optional.  There is no default value.

   type:  specifies the type of the external dialog document indicated
      in the 'src' attribute.  A valid value is a MIME media type (see
      Section 4.6.10).  If the URI scheme used in the src attribute
      defines a mechanism for establishing the authoritative MIME media
      type of the media resource, the value returned by that mechanism
      takes precedence over this attribute.  The attribute is optional.
      There is no default value.

   maxage:  Used to set the max-age value of the 'Cache-Control' header
      in conjunction with an external dialog document fetched using
      HTTP, as per [RFC2616].  A valid value is a non-negative integer
      (see Section 4.6.4).  The attribute is optional.  There is no
      default value.

   maxstale:  Used to set the max-stale value of the 'Cache-Control'
      header in conjunction with an external dialog document fetched
      using HTTP, as per [RFC2616].  A valid value is a non-negative
      integer (see Section 4.6.4).  The attribute is optional.  There is
      no default value.

   fetchtimeout:  the maximum timeout interval to wait when fetching an
      external dialog document.  A valid value is a Time Designation
      (see Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is optional.  The default
      value is 30s.

   dialogid:  string indicating a unique name for the dialog.  If a
      dialog with the same name already exists on the MS, the MS sends a
      <response> with a 405 status code (Section 4.5).  If this
      attribute is not specified, the MS MUST create a unique name for
      the dialog (see Section 4.2 for dialog identifier assignment).
      The attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   The <dialogprepare> element has the following sequence of child
   elements:

   <dialog>  an IVR dialog (Section 4.3) to prepare.  The element is
      optional.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 19]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <params>:  specifies input parameters (Section 4.2.6) for dialog
      languages defined outside this specification.  The element is
      optional.  If a parameter is not supported by the MS for the
      external dialog language, the MS sends a <response> with a 427
      status code (Section 4.5).

   The dialog to prepare can be specified either inline with a <dialog>
   child element or externally (for dialog languages defined outside
   this specification) using the src attribute.  It is a syntax error if
   both an inline <dialog> element and a src attribute are specified and
   the MS sends a <response> with a 400 status code (see Section 4.5).
   The type, maxage, maxstale, and fetchtimeout attributes are only
   relevant when a dialog is specified as an external document.

   For example, a <dialogprepare> request to prepare an inline IVR
   dialog with a single prompt:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogprepare>
     <dialog>
      <prompt>
       <media loc="http://www.example.com/welcome.wav"/>
      </prompt>
     </dialog>
    </dialogprepare>
   </mscivr>

   In this example, a request with a specified dialogid to prepare a
   VoiceXML dialog document located externally:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogprepare dialogid="d2" type="application/voicexml+xml"
                   src="http://www.example.com/mydialog.vxml"
                   fetchtimeout="15s"/>
   </mscivr>

   Since MS support for dialog languages other than the IVR dialog
   language defined in this package is optional, if the MS does not
   support the dialog language, it would send a response with the status
   code 421 (Section 4.5).  Further information on using VoiceXML can be
   found in Section 9.

4.2.2.  <dialogstart>

   The <dialogstart> element is sent to the MS to start a dialog.  If
   the dialog has not been prepared, the dialog is prepared (retrieving
   external document and/or external resources referenced within
   <dialog> element and the dialog document validated syntactically and

   semantically).  Media processors (e.g., DTMF and prompt queue) are
   activated and associated with the specified connection or conference.

   The <dialogstart> element has the following attributes:

   src:  specifies the location of an external dialog document to start.
      A valid value is a URI (see Section 4.6.9).  The MS MUST support
      both HTTP [RFC2616] and HTTPS [RFC2818] schemes and the MS MAY
      support other schemes.  If the URI scheme is unsupported, the MS
      sends a <response> with a 420 status code (Section 4.5).  If the
      document cannot be retrieved with the timeout interval, the MS
      sends a <response> with a 409 status code.  If the document
      contains a type of dialog language that the MS does not support,
      the MS sends a <response> with a 421 status code.  The attribute
      is optional.  There is no default value.

   type:  specifies the type of the external dialog document indicated
      in the 'src' attribute.  A valid value is a MIME media type (see
      Section 4.6.10).  If the URI scheme used in the src attribute
      defines a mechanism for establishing the authoritative MIME media
      type of the media resource, the value returned by that mechanism
      takes precedence over this attribute.  The attribute is optional.
      There is no default value.

   maxage:  Used to set the max-age value of the 'Cache-Control' header
      in conjunction with an external dialog document fetched using
      HTTP, as per [RFC2616].  A valid value is a non-negative integer
      (see Section 4.6.4).  The attribute is optional.  There is no
      default value.

   maxstale:  Used to set the max-stale value of the 'Cache-Control'
      header in conjunction with an external dialog document fetched
      using HTTP, as per [RFC2616].  A valid value is a non-negative
      integer (see Section 4.6.4).  The attribute is optional.  There is
      no default value.

   fetchtimeout:  the maximum timeout interval to wait when fetching an
      external dialog document.  A valid value is a Time Designation
      (see Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is optional.  The default
      value is 30s.

   dialogid:  string indicating a unique name for the dialog.  If a
      dialog with the same name already exists on the MS, the MS sends a
      <response> with a 405 status code (Section 4.5).  If neither the
      dialogid attribute nor the prepareddialogid attribute is
      specified, the MS MUST create a unique name for the dialog (see
      Section 4.2 for dialog identifier assignment).  The attribute is
      optional.  There is no default value.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 21]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   prepareddialogid:  string identifying a dialog previously prepared
      using a dialogprepare (Section 4.2.1) request.  If neither the
      dialogid attribute nor the prepareddialogid attribute is
      specified, the MS MUST create a unique name for the dialog (see
      Section 4.2 for dialog identifier assignment).  The attribute is
      optional.  There is no default value.

   connectionid:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection on which
      this dialog is to be started (see Appendix A.1 of [RFC6230]).  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   conferenceid:  string identifying the conference on which this dialog
      is to be started (see Appendix A.1 of [RFC6230]).  The attribute
      is optional.  There is no default value.

   Exactly one of the connectionid or conferenceid attributes MUST be
   specified.  If both the connectionid and conferenceid attributes are
   specified or neither is specified, it is a syntax error and the MS
   sends a <response> with a 400 status code (Section 4.5).

   It is an error if the connection or conference referenced by a
   specific connectionid or conferenceid attribute is not available on
   the MS at the time the <dialogstart> request is executed.  If an
   invalid connectionid is specified, the MS sends a <response> with a
   407 status code (Section 4.5).  If an invalid conferenceid is
   specified, the MS sends a <response> with a 408 status code.

   The <dialogstart> element has the following sequence of child
   elements:

   <dialog>:  specifies an IVR dialog (Section 4.3) to execute.  The
      element is optional.

   <subscribe>:  specifies subscriptions to dialog events
      (Section 4.2.2.1).  The element is optional.

   <params>:  specifies input parameters (Section 4.2.6) for dialog
      languages defined outside this specification.  The element is
      optional.  If a parameter is not supported by the MS for the
      external dialog language, the MS sends a <response> with a 427
      status code (Section 4.5).

   <stream>:  determines the media stream(s) associated with the
      connection or conference on which the dialog is executed
      (Section 4.2.2.2).  The <stream> element is optional.  Multiple
      <stream> elements can be specified.





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 22]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The dialog to start can be specified either (a) inline with a
   <dialog> child element, (b) externally using the src attribute (for
   dialog languages defined outside this specification), or (c) by
   referencing a previously prepared dialog using the prepareddialogid
   attribute.  If exactly one of the src attribute, the
   prepareddialogid, or a <dialog> child element is not specified, it is
   a syntax error and the MS sends a <response> with a 400 status code
   (Section 4.5).  If the prepareddialogid and dialogid attributes are
   specified, it is also a syntax error and the MS sends a <response>
   with a 400 status code.  The type, maxage, maxstale, and fetchtimeout
   attributes are only relevant when a dialog is specified as an
   external document.

   The <stream> element provides explicit control over which media
   streams on the connection or conference are used during dialog
   execution.  For example, if a connection supports both audio and
   video streams, a <stream> element could be used to indicate that only
   the audio stream is used in receive mode.  In cases where there are
   multiple media streams of the same type for a dialog, the AS MUST use
   <stream> elements to explicitly specify the configuration.  If no
   <stream> elements are specified, then the default media configuration
   is that defined for the connection or conference.

   If a <stream> element is in conflict (a) with another <stream>
   element, (b) with specified connection or conference media
   capabilities, or (c) with a Session Description Protocol (SDP) label
   value as part of the connectionid (see Appendix A.1 of [RFC6230]),
   then the MS sends a <response> with a 411 status code (Section 4.5).
   If the media stream configuration is not supported by the MS, then
   the MS sends a <response> with a 428 status code (Section 4.5).

   The MS MAY support multiple, simultaneous dialogs being started on
   the same connection or conference.  For example, the same connection
   can receive different media streams (e.g., audio and video) from
   different dialogs, or receive (and implicitly mix where appropriate)
   the same type of media streams from different dialogs.  If the MS
   does not support starting another dialog on the same connection or
   conference, it sends a <response> with a 432 status code
   (Section 4.5) when it receives the second (or subsequent) dialog
   request.

   For example, a request to start an ivr dialog on a connection
   subscribing to DTMF notifications:








McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 23]

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="connection1">

       <media loc="http://www.example.com/getpin.wav"/>

     </dialog>
    <subscribe>
     <dtmfsub matchmode="all"/>
    </subscribe>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   In this example, the dialog is started on a conference where the
   conference only receives an audio media stream from the dialog:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart conferenceid="conference1">
     <dialog>
      <record maxtime="384000s"/>
     </dialog>
     <stream media="audio" direction="recvonly"/>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

4.2.2.1.  <subscribe>

   The <subscribe> element allows the AS to subscribe to, and be
   notified of, specific events that occur during execution of the
   dialog.  Notifications of dialog events are delivered using the
   <event> element (see Section 4.2.5).

   The <subscribe> element has no attributes.

   The <subscribe> element has the following sequence of child elements
   (0 or more occurrences):

   <dtmfsub>:  Subscription to DTMF input during the dialog
      (Section 4.2.2.1.1).  The element is optional.

   If a request has a <subscribe> with no child elements, the MS treats
   the request as if no <subscribe> element were specified.

   The MS MUST support <dtmfsub> subscription for the IVR dialog
   language defined in this specification (Section 4.3).  It MAY support
   other dialog subscriptions (specified using attributes and child
   elements from a foreign namespace).  If the MS does not support a

   subscription specified in a foreign namespace, the MS sends a
   response with a 431 status code (see Section 4.5).

4.2.2.1.1.  <dtmfsub>

   The <dtmfsub> element has the following attributes:

   matchmode:  controls which DTMF input is subscribed to.  Valid values
      are "all" - notify all DTMF key presses received during the
      dialog; "collect" - notify only DTMF input matched by the collect
      operation (Section 4.3.1.3); and "control" - notify only DTMF
      input matched by the runtime control operation (Section 4.3.1.2).
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is "all".

   The <dtmfsub> element has no child elements.

   DTMF notifications are delivered in the <dtmfnotify> element
   (Section 4.2.5.2).

   For example, the AS wishes to subscribe to DTMF key press matching a
   runtime control:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart dialogid="d3" connectionid="connection1">
     <dialog>
      <prompt>
       <media loc="http://www.example.com/getpin.wav"/>
      </prompt>
      <control ffkey="2" rwkey="3"/>
     </dialog>
    <subscribe>
     <dtmfsub matchmode="control"/>
    </subscribe>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   Each time a '2' or '3' DTMF input is received, the MS sends a
   notification event:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="d3">
      <dtmfnotify matchmode="collect" dtmf="2"
          timestamp="2008-05-12T12:13:14Z"/>

4.2.2.2.  <stream>

   The <stream> element has the following attributes:

   media:  a string indicating the type of media associated with the
      stream.  A valid value is a MIME type-name as defined in Section
      4.2 of [RFC4288].  The following values MUST be used for common
      types of media: "audio" for audio media, and "video" for video
      media.  See [IANA] for registered MIME type names.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

   label:  a string indicating the SDP label associated with a media
      stream [RFC4574].  The attribute is optional.

   direction:  a string indicating the direction of the media flow
      relative to the endpoint conference or connection.  Defined values
      are "sendrecv" (the endpoint can send media to, and receive media
      from, the dialog), "sendonly" (the endpoint can only send media to
      the dialog), "recvonly" (the endpoint can only receive media from
      the dialog), and "inactive" (stream is not to be used).  The
      default value is "sendrecv".  The attribute is optional.

   The <stream> element has the following sequence of child elements:

   <region>:  an element to specify the area within a mixer video layout
      where a media stream is displayed (Section 4.2.2.2.1).  The
      element is optional.

   <priority>:  an element to configure priority associated with the
      stream in the conference mix (Section 4.2.2.2.2).  The element is
      optional.

   If conferenceid is not specified or if the "media" attribute does not
   have the value of "video", then the MS ignores the <region> and
   <priority> elements.

   For example, assume a User Agent connection with multiple audio and
   video streams associated with the user and a separate web camera.  In
   this case, the dialog could be started to record only the audio and
   video streams associated with the user:

    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   Using the <region> element, the dialog can be started on a conference
   mixer so that the video output from the dialog is directed to a
   specific area within a video layout.  For example:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart conferenceid="conference1">
     <dialog>
      <prompt>
        <media loc="http://www.example.com/presentation.3gp"/>
      </prompt>
     </dialog>
     <stream media="video" direction="recvonly">
       <region>1</region>
     </stream>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

4.2.2.2.1.  <region>

   The <region> element is used to specify a named area within a
   presentation layout where a video media stream is displayed.  The MS
   could, for example, play video media into an area of a video layout
   where the layout and its named regions are specified using the Mixer
   Control Package [MIXER-CP].

   The <region> element has no attributes and its content model
   specifies the name of the region.

   If the region name is invalid, then the MS reports a 416 status code
   (Section 4.5) in the response to the request element containing the
   <region> element.

4.2.2.2.2.  <priority>

   The <priority> element is used to explicitly specify the priority of
   the dialog for presentation in a conference mix.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The <priority> element has no attributes and its content model
   specifies a positive integer (see Section 4.6.5).  The lower the
   value, the higher the priority.

4.2.3.  <dialogterminate>

   A dialog can be terminated by sending a <dialogterminate> request
   element to the MS.

   The <dialogterminate> element has the following attributes:

   dialogid:  string identifying the dialog to terminate.  If the
      specified dialog identifier is invalid, the MS sends a response
      with a 405 status code (Section 4.5).  The attribute is mandatory.

   immediate:  indicates whether or not a dialog in the STARTED state is
      to be terminated immediately (in other states, termination is
      always immediate).  A valid value is a boolean (see
      Section 4.6.1).  A value of true indicates that the dialog is
      terminated immediately and the MS MUST send a dialogexit
      notification (Section 4.2.5.1) without report information.  A
      value of false indicates that the dialog terminates after the
      current iteration and the MS MUST send a dialogexit notification
      with report information.  The attribute is optional.  The default
      value is false.

   The MS MUST reply to the <dialogterminate> request with a <response>
   element (Section 4.2.4), reporting whether or not the dialog was
   terminated successfully.

   For example, immediately terminating a STARTED dialog with dialogid
   "d4":

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogterminate dialogid="d4" immediate="true"/>
   </mscivr>

   If the dialog is terminated successfully, then the response to the
   dialogterminate request would be:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <response status="200" dialogid="d4"/>
   </mscivr>

4.2.4.  <response>

   Responses to dialog management requests are specified with a
   <response> element.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The <response> element has following attributes:

   status:  numeric code indicating the response status.  Valid values
      are defined in Section 4.5.  The attribute is mandatory.

   reason:  string specifying a reason for the response status.  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   desclang:  specifies the language used in the value of the reason
      attribute.  A valid value is a language identifier
      (Section 4.6.11).  The attribute is optional.  If not specified,
      the value of the desclang attribute on <mscivr> (Section 4.1)
      applies.

   dialogid:  string identifying the dialog.  If the request specifies a
      dialogid, then that value is used.  Otherwise, with
      <dialogprepare> and <dialogstart> requests, the dialogid generated
      by the MS is used.  If there is no available dialogid because the
      request is syntactically invalid (e.g., a <dialogterminate>
      request with no dialogid attribute specified), then the value is
      the empty string.  The attribute is mandatory.

   connectionid:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection
      associated with the dialog (see Appendix A.1 of [RFC6230]).  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   conferenceid:  string identifying the conference associated with the
      dialog (see Appendix A.1 of [RFC6230]).  The attribute is
      optional.  There is no default value.

   For example, a response when a dialog was prepared successfully:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <response status="200" dialogid="d5"/>
   </mscivr>

   The response if dialog preparation failed due to an unsupported
   dialog language:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <response status="421" dialogid="d5"
       reason="Unsupported dialog language: application/voicexml+xml"/>
   </mscivr>

   In this example, a <dialogterminate> request does not specify a
   dialogid:





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 29]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogterminate/>
   </mscivr>

   The response status indicates a 400 (Syntax error) status code and
   the dialogid attribute has an empty string value:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <response status="400" dialogid=" "
       reason="Attribute required: dialogid"/>
   </mscivr>

4.2.5.  <event>

   When a dialog generates a notification event, the MS sends the event
   using an <event> element.

   The <event> element has the following attributes:

   dialogid:  string identifying the dialog that generated the event.
      The attribute is mandatory.

   The <event> element has the following child elements, only one of
   which can occur:

   <dialogexit>:  indicates that the dialog has exited
      (Section 4.2.5.1).

   <dtmfnotify>:  indicates that a DTMF key press occurred
      (Section 4.2.5.2).

4.2.5.1.  <dialogexit>

   The <dialogexit> event indicates that a prepared or active dialog has
   exited because it is complete, it has been terminated, or an error
   occurred during execution (for example, a media resource cannot be
   played).  This event MUST be sent by the MS when the dialog exits.

   The <dialogexit> element has the following attributes:

   status:  a status code indicating the status of the dialog when it
      exits.  A valid value is a non-negative integer (see
      Section 4.6.4).  The MS MUST support the following values:

      0  indicates the dialog has been terminated by a <dialogterminate>
         request.

      1  indicates successful completion of the dialog.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 30]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


      2  indicates the dialog terminated because the connection or
         conference associated with the dialog has terminated.

      3  indicates the dialog terminated due to exceeding its maximum
         duration.

      4  indicates the dialog terminated due to an execution error.

      All other valid but undefined values are reserved for future use,
      where new status codes are assigned using the Standards Action
      process defined in [RFC5226].  The AS MUST treat any status code
      it does not recognize as being equivalent to 4 (dialog execution
      error).  The attribute is mandatory.

   reason:  a textual description that the MS SHOULD use to provide a
      reason for the status code, e.g., details about an error.  A valid
      value is a string (see Section 4.6.6).  The attribute is optional.
      There is no default value.

   desclang:  specifies the language used in the value of the reason
      attribute.  A valid value is a language identifier
      (Section 4.6.11).  The attribute is optional.  If not specified,
      the value of the desclang attribute on <mscivr> (Section 4.1)
      applies.

   The <dialogexit> element has the following sequence of child
   elements:

   <promptinfo>:  report information (Section 4.3.2.1) about the prompt
      execution in an IVR <dialog>.  The element is optional.

   <controlinfo>:  reports information (Section 4.3.2.2) about the
      control execution in an IVR <dialog>.  The element is optional.

   <collectinfo>:  reports information (Section 4.3.2.3) about the
      collect execution in an IVR <dialog>.  The element is optional.

   <recordinfo>:  reports information (Section 4.3.2.4) about the record
      execution in an IVR <dialog>.  The element is optional.

   <params>:  reports exit parameters (Section 4.2.6) for a dialog
      language defined outside this specification.  The element is
      optional.

   For example, when an active <dialog> exits normally, the MS sends a
   dialogexit <event> reporting information:

      <collectinfo dtmf="1234"  termmode="match"/>
     </dialogexit>
    </event>
   </mscivr>

4.2.5.2.  <dtmfnotify>

   The <dtmfnotify> element provides a notification of DTMF input
   received during the active dialog as requested by a <dtmfsub>
   subscription (Section 4.2.2.1).

   The <dtmfnotify> element has the following attributes:

   matchmode:  indicates the matching mode specified in the subscription
      request.  Valid values are as follows:

         "all" - all DTMF key presses notified individually;

         "collect" - only DTMF input matched by the collect operation
         notified; and

         "control" - only DTMF input matched by the control operation
         notified.

      The attribute is optional.  The default value is "all".

   dtmf:  DTMF key presses received according to the matchmode.  A valid
      value is a DTMF string (see Section 4.6.3) with no space between
      characters.  The attribute is mandatory.

   timestamp:  indicates the time (on the MS) at which the last key
      press occurred according to the matchmode.  A valid value is a
      dateTime expression (Section 4.6.12).  The attribute is mandatory.

   For example, a notification of DTMF input matched during the collect
   operation:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="d3">
      <dtmfnotify matchmode="collect" dtmf="3123"
        timestamp="2008-05-12T12:13:14Z"/>

4.2.6.  <params>

   The <params> element is a container for <param> elements
   (Section 4.2.6.1).

   The <params> element has no attributes, but the following child
   elements are defined (0 or more):

   <param>:  specifies a parameter name and value (Section 4.2.6.1).

   For example, usage with a dialog language defined outside this
   specification to send additional parameters into the dialog:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
   <dialogstart type="application/x-dialog"
                src="nfs://nas01/dialog4" connectionid="c1">

      <param name="prompt2">nfs://nas01/media2.3gp</param>
     </params>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

4.2.6.1.  <param>

   The <param> element describes a parameter name and value.

   The <param> element has the following attributes:

   name:  a string indicating the name of the parameter.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

   type:  specifies a type indicating how the inline value of the
      parameter is to be interpreted.  A valid value is a MIME media
      type (see Section 4.6.10).  The attribute is optional.  The
      default value is "text/plain".

   encoding:  specifies a content-transfer-encoding schema applied to
      the inline value of the parameter on top of the MIME media type
      specified with the type attribute.  A valid value is a content-
      transfer-encoding schema as defined by the "mechanism" token in
      Section 6.1 of [RFC2045].  The attribute is optional.  There is no
      default value.

   The <param> element content model is the value of the parameter.
   Note that a value that contains XML characters (e.g., "<") needs to
   be escaped following standard XML conventions.

4.3.  IVR Dialog Elements

   This section describes the IVR dialog language defined as part of
   this specification.  The MS MUST support this dialog language.

   The <dialog> element is an execution container for operations of
   playing prompts (Section 4.3.1.1), runtime controls
   (Section 4.3.1.2), collecting DTMF (Section 4.3.1.3), and recording
   user input (Section 4.3.1.4).  Results of the dialog execution
   (Section 4.3.2) are reported in a dialogexit notification event.

   Using these elements, three common dialog models are supported:

   playannouncements:  only a <prompt> element is specified in the
      container.  The prompt media resources are played in sequence.

   promptandcollect:  a <collect> element is specified and, optionally,
      a <prompt> element.  If a <prompt> element is specified and
      bargein is enabled, playing of the prompt is terminated when
      bargein occurs, and DTMF collection is initiated; otherwise, the
      prompt is played to completion before DTMF collection is
      initiated.  If no prompt element is specified, DTMF collection is
      initiated immediately.

   promptandrecord:  a <record> element is specified and, optionally, a
      <prompt> element.  If a <prompt> element is specified and bargein
      is enabled, playing of the prompt is terminated when bargein
      occurs, and recording is initiated; otherwise, the prompt is
      played to completion before recording is initiated.  If no prompt
      element is specified, recording is initiated immediately.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 34]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   In addition, this dialog language supports runtime ('VCR') controls
   enabling a user to control prompt playback using DTMF.

   Each of the core elements -- <prompt>, <control>, <collect>, and
   <record> -- are specified so that their execution and reporting is
   largely self-contained.  This facilitates their reuse in other dialog
   container elements.  Note that DTMF and bargein behavior affects
   multiple elements and is addressed in the relevant element
   definitions.

   Execution results are reported in the <dialogexit> notification event
   with child elements defined in Section 4.3.2.  If the dialog
   terminated normally (i.e., not due to an error or to a
   <dialogterminate> request), then the MS MUST report the results for
   the operations specified in the dialog:

   <prompt>:  <promptinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.1) with at least the
      termmode attribute specified.

   <control>:  <controlinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.2) if any runtime
      controls are matched.

   <collect>:  <collectinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.3) with the dtmf and
      termmode attributes specified.

   <record>:  <recordinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.4) with at least the
      termmode attribute and one <mediainfo> element specified.

   The media format requirements for IVR dialogs are undefined.  This
   package is agnostic to the media types and codecs for media resources
   and recording that need to be supported by an implementation.  For
   example, an MS implementation might only support audio and in
   particular the 'audio/basic' codec for media playback and recording.
   However, when executing a dialog, if an MS encounters a media type or
   codec that it cannot process, the MS MUST stop further processing and
   report the error using the dialogexit notification.

4.3.1.  <dialog>

   An IVR dialog to play prompts to the user, allow runtime controls,
   collect DTMF, or record input.  The dialog is specified using a
   <dialog> element.

   A <dialog> element has the following attributes:







McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 35]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   repeatCount:  number of times the dialog is to be executed.  A valid
      value is a non-negative integer (see Section 4.6.4).  A value of 0
      indicates that the dialog is repeated until halted by other means.
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is 1.

   repeatDur:  maximum duration for dialog execution.  A valid value is
      a time designation (see Section 4.6.7).  If no value is specified,
      then there is no limit on the duration of the dialog.  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   repeatUntilComplete:  indicates whether the MS terminates dialog
      execution when an input operation is completed successfully.  A
      valid value is a boolean (see Section 4.6.1).  A value of true
      indicates that dialog execution is terminated when an input
      operation associated with its child elements is completed
      successfully (see execution model below for precise conditions).
      A value of false indicates that dialog execution is terminated by
      other means.  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      false.

   The repeatDur attribute takes priority over the repeatCount attribute
   in determining maximum duration of the dialog.  See 'repeatCount' and
   'repeatDur' in the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language
   (SMIL) [W3C.REC-SMIL2-20051213] for further information.  In the
   situation where a dialog is repeated more than once, only the results
   of operations in the last dialog iteration are reported.

   The <dialog> element has the following sequence of child elements (at
   least one, any order):

   <prompt>:  defines media resources to play in sequence (see
      Section 4.3.1.1).  The element is optional.

   <control>:  defines how DTMF is used for runtime controls (see
      Section 4.3.1.2).  The element is optional.

   <collect>:  defines how DTMF is collected (see Section 4.3.1.3).  The
      element is optional.

   <record>:  defines how recording takes place (see Section 4.3.1.4).
      The element is optional.

   Although the behavior when both <collect> and <record> elements are
   specified in a request is not defined in this Control Package, the MS
   MAY support this configuration.  If the MS does not support this
   configuration, the MS sends a <response> with a 433 status code.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The MS has the following execution model for the IVR dialog after
   initialization (initialization errors are reported by the MS in the
   response):

   1.  If an error occurs during execution, then the MS terminates the
       dialog and reports the error in the <dialogexit> event by setting
       the status attribute (see Section 4.3.2).  Details about the
       error are specified in the reason attribute.

   2.  The MS initializes a counter to 0.

   3.  The MS starts a duration timer for the value of the repeatDur
       attribute.  If the timer expires before the dialog is complete,
       then the MS terminates the dialog and sends a dialogexit whose
       status attribute is set to 3 (see Section 4.2.5.1).  The MS MAY
       report information in the dialogexit gathered in the last
       execution cycle (if any).

   4.  The MS initiates a dialog execution cycle.  Each cycle executes
       the operations associated with the child elements of the dialog.
       If a <prompt> element is specified, then execute the element's
       prompt playing operation and activate any controls (if the
       <control> element is specified).  If no <prompt> is specified or
       when a specified <prompt> terminates, then start the collect
       operation or the record operation if the <collect> or <record>
       elements, respectively, are specified.  If subscriptions are
       specified for the dialog, then the MS sends a notification event
       when the specified event occurs.  If execution of a child element
       results in an error, the MS terminates dialog execution (and
       stops other child element operations) and the MS sends a
       dialogexit status event, reporting any information gathered.

   5.  If the dialog execution cycle completes successfully, then the MS
       increments the counter by one.  The MS terminates dialog
       execution if either of the following conditions is true:

       *  the value of the repeatCount attribute is greater than zero,
          and the counter is equal to the value of the repeatCount
          attribute.

       *  the value of the repeatUntilComplete attribute is true and one
          of the following conditions is true:

          +  <collect> reports termination status of 'match' or
             'stopped'.

          +  <record> reports termination status of 'stopped', 'dtmf',
             'maxtime', or 'finalsilence'.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


       When the MS terminates dialog execution, it sends a dialogexit
       (with a status of 1) reporting operation information collected in
       the last dialog execution cycle only.  Otherwise, another dialog
       execution cycle is initiated.

4.3.1.1.  <prompt>

   The <prompt> element specifies a sequence of media resources to play
   back in document order.

   A <prompt> element has the following attributes:

   xml:base:  A string declaring the base URI from which relative URIs
      in child elements are resolved prior to fetching.  A valid value
      is a URI (see Section 4.6.9).  The attribute is optional.  There
      is no default value.

   bargein:  Indicates whether user input stops prompt playback unless
      the input is associated with a specified runtime <control>
      operation (input matching control operations never interrupts
      prompt playback).  A valid value is a boolean (see Section 4.6.1).
      A value of true indicates that bargein is permitted and prompt
      playback is stopped.  A value of false indicates that bargein is
      not permitted: user input does not terminate prompt playback.  The
      attribute is optional.  The default value is true.

   The <prompt> element has the following child elements (at least one,
   any order, multiple occurrences of elements permitted):

   <media>:  specifies a media resource (see Section 4.3.1.5) to play.
      The element is optional.

   <variable>:  specifies a variable media announcement (see
      Section 4.3.1.1.1) to play.  The element is optional.

   <dtmf>:  generates one or more DTMF tones (see Section 4.3.1.1.2) to
      play.  The element is optional.

   <par>:  specifies media resources to play in parallel (see
      Section 4.3.1.1.3).  The element is optional.

   If the MS does not support the configuration required for prompt
   playback to the output media streams and a more specific error code
   is not defined for its child elements, the MS sends a <response> with
   a 429 status code (Section 4.5).  The MS MAY support transcoding
   between the media resource format and the output stream format.





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 38]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The MS has the following execution model for prompt playing after
   initialization:

   1.  The MS initiates prompt playback playing its child elements
       (<media>, <variable>, <dtmf>, and <par>) one after another in
       document order.

   2.  If any error (including fetching and rendering errors) occurs
       during prompt execution, then the MS terminates playback and
       reports its error status to the dialog container (see
       Section 4.3) with a <promptinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.1) where the
       termmode attribute is set to stopped and any additional
       information is set.

   3.  If DTMF input is received and the value of the bargein attribute
       is true, then the MS terminates prompt playback and reports its
       execution status to the dialog container (see Section 4.3) with a
       <promptinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.1) where the termmode attribute
       is set to bargein and any additional information is set.

   4.  If prompt playback is stopped by the dialog container, then the
       MS reports its execution status to the dialog container (see
       Section 4.3) with a <promptinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.1) where the
       termmode attribute is set to stopped and any additional
       information is set.

   5.  If prompt playback completes successfully, then the MS reports
       its execution status to the dialog container (see Section 4.3)
       with a <promptinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.1) where the termmode
       attribute is set to completed and any additional information is
       set.

4.3.1.1.1.  <variable>

   The <variable> element specifies variable announcements using
   predefined media resources.  Each variable has at least a type (e.g.,
   date) and a value (e.g., 2008-02-25).  The value is rendered
   according to the prompt variable type (e.g., 2008-02-25 is rendered
   as the date 25th February 2008).  The precise mechanism for
   generating variable announcements (including the location of
   associated media resources) is implementation specific.

   A <variable> element has the following attributes:

   type:  specifies the type of prompt variable to render.  This
      specification defines three values -- date (Section 4.3.1.1.1.1),
      time (Section 4.3.1.1.1.2), and digits (Section 4.3.1.1.1.3).  All
      other valid but undefined values are reserved for future use,



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 39]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


      where new values are assigned as described in Section 8.5.  A
      valid value is a string (see Section 4.6.6).  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   value:  specifies a string to be rendered according to the prompt
      variable type.  A valid value is a string (see Section 4.6.6).
      The attribute is mandatory.

   format:  specifies format information that the prompt variable type
      uses to render the value attribute.  A valid value is a string
      (see Section 4.6.6).  The attribute is optional.  There is no
      default value.

   gender:  specifies the gender that the prompt variable type uses to
      render the value attribute.  Valid values are "male" or "female".
      The attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   xml:lang:  specifies the language that the prompt variable type uses
      to render the value attribute.  A valid value is a language
      identifier (see Section 4.6.11).  The attribute is optional.
      There is no default value.

   The <variable> element has no children.

   This specification is agnostic to the type and codec of media
   resources into which variables are rendered as well as the rendering
   mechanism itself.  For example, an MS implementation supporting audio
   rendering could map the <variable> into one or more audio media
   resources.

   This package is agnostic to which <variable> types are supported by
   an implementation.  If a <variable> element configuration specified
   in a request is not supported by the MS, the MS sends a <response>
   with a 425 status code (Section 4.5).

4.3.1.1.1.1.  Date Type

   The date variable type provides a mechanism for dynamically rendering
   a date prompt.

   The <variable> type attribute MUST have the value "date".

   The <variable> format attribute MUST be one of the following values
   and comply with its rendering of the value attribute:

   mdy  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as sequence composed of month, then day, then year.




McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 40]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   ymd  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as sequence composed of year, then month, then day.

   dym  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as sequence composed of day, then year, then month.

   dm   indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as sequence composed of day then month.

   The <variable> value attribute MUST comply with a lexical
   representation of date where

   yyyy '-' mm '-' dd

   as defined in Section 3.2.9 of [XMLSchema:Part2].

   For example,

     <variable type="date" format="dmy" value="2010-11-25"
     xml:lang="en" gender="male"/>

   describes a variable date prompt where the date can be rendered in
   audio as "twenty-fifth of November two thousand and ten" using a list
   of <media> resources:

   <media loc="nfs://voicebase/en/male/25th.wav"/>
   <media loc="nfs://voicebase/en/male/of.wav"/>
   <media loc="nfs://voicebase/en/male/november.wav"/>
   <media loc="nfs://voicebase/en/male/2000.wav"/>
   <media loc="nfs://voicebase/en/male/and.wav"/>
   <media loc="nfs://voicebase/en/male/10.wav"/>

4.3.1.1.1.2.  Time Type

   The time variable type provides a mechanism for dynamically rendering
   a time prompt.

   The <variable> type attribute MUST have the value "time".

   The <variable> format attribute MUST be one of the following values
   and comply with its rendering of the value attribute:

   t12  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as a time in traditional 12-hour format using am or pm (for
        example, "twenty-five minutes past 2 pm" for "14:25").






McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 41]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   t24  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as a time in 24-hour format (for example, "fourteen twenty-five"
        for "14:25").

   The <variable> value attribute MUST comply with a lexical
   representation of time where

   hh ':' mm ( ':' ss )?

   as defined in Section 3.2.8 of [XMLSchema:Part2].

4.3.1.1.1.3.  Digits Type

   The digits variable type provides a mechanism for dynamically
   rendering a digit sequence.

   The <variable> type attribute MUST have the value "digits".

   The <variable> format attribute MUST be one of the following values
   and comply with its rendering of the value attribute:

   gen  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as a general digit string (for example, "one two three" for
        "123").

   crn  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as a cardinal number (for example, "one hundred and twenty-
        three" for "123").

   ord  indicating that the <variable> value attribute is to be rendered
        as an ordinal number (for example, "one hundred and twenty-
        third" for "123").

   The <variable> value attribute MUST comply with the lexical
   representation

      d+

   i.e., one or more digits.

4.3.1.1.2.  <dtmf>

   The <dtmf> element specifies a sequence of DTMF tones for output.

   DTMF tones could be generated using <media> resources where the
   output is transported as RTP audio packets.  However, <media>
   resources are not sufficient for cases where DTMF tones are to be
   transported as DTMF RTP [RFC4733] or in event packages.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 42]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   A <dtmf> element has the following attributes:

   digits:  specifies the DTMF sequence to output.  A valid value is a
      DTMF string (see Section 4.6.3).  The attribute is mandatory.

   level:  used to define the power level for which the DTMF tones will
      be generated.  Values are expressed in dBm0.  A valid value is an
      integer in the range of 0 to -96 (dBm0).  Larger negative values
      express lower power levels.  Note that values lower than -55 dBm0
      will be rejected by most receivers (TR-TSY-000181, ITU-T Q.24A).
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is -6 (dBm0).

   duration:  specifies the duration for which each DTMF tone is
      generated.  A valid value is a time designation (see
      Section 4.6.7).  The MS MAY round the value if it only supports
      discrete durations.  The attribute is optional.  The default value
      is 100 ms.

   interval:  specifies the duration of a silence interval following
      each generated DTMF tone.  A valid value is a time designation
      (see Section 4.6.7).  The MS MAY round the value if it only
      supports discrete durations.  The attribute is optional.  The
      default value is 100 ms.

   The <dtmf> element has no children.

   If a <dtmf> element configuration is not supported, the MS sends a
   <response> with a 426 status code (Section 4.5).

4.3.1.1.3.  <par>

   The <par> element allows media resources to be played in parallel.
   Each of its child elements specifies a media resource (or a sequence
   of media resources using the <seq> element).  When playback of the
   <par> element is initiated, the MS begins playback of all its child
   elements at the same time.  This element is modeled after the <par>
   element in SMIL [W3C.REC-SMIL2-20051213].

   The <par> element has the following attributes:

   endsync:  indicates when playback of the element is complete.  Valid
      values are "first" (indicates that the element is complete when
      any child element reports that it is complete) and "last"
      (indicates it is complete when every child elements are complete).
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is "last".

   If the value is "first", then playback of other child elements is
   stopped when one child element reports it is complete.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 43]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The <par> element has the following child elements (at least one, any
   order, multiple occurrences of each element permitted):

   <seq>:  specifies a sequence of media resources to play in parallel
      with other <par> child elements (see Section 4.3.1.1.3.1).  The
      element is optional.

   <media>:  specifies a media resource (see Section 4.3.1.5) to play.
      The MS is responsible for assigning the appropriate media
      stream(s) when more than one is available.  The element is
      optional.

   <variable>:  specifies a variable media announcement (see
      Section 4.3.1.1.1) to play.  The element is optional.

   <dtmf>:  generates one or more DTMF tones (see Section 4.3.1.1.2) to
      play.  The element is optional.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a <par> element contains only one <media>
   element of the same media type (i.e., same type-name as defined in
   Section 4.6.10).  If a <par> element configuration is not supported,
   the MS sends a <response> with a 435 status code (Section 4.5).

   Runtime <control>s (Section 4.3.1.2) apply to each child element
   playing in parallel.  For example, pause and resume controls cause
   all child elements to be paused and resumed, respectively.

   If the <par> element is stopped by the prompt container (e.g.,
   bargein or dialog termination), then playback of all child elements
   is stopped.  The playback duration (Section 4.3.2.1) reported for the
   <par> element is the duration of parallel playback, not the
   cumulative duration of each child element played in parallel.

   For example, a request to playback audio and video media in parallel:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
   <dialogstart connectionid="c1">
     <dialog>
      <prompt>
       <par>

       </par>
      </prompt>
     </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   When the <prompt> element is executed, it begins playback of its
   child element in document-order sequence.  In this case, there is
   only one child element, a <par> element itself containing audio and
   video <media> child elements.  Consequently, playback of both audio
   and video media resources is initiated at the same time.  Since the
   endsync attribute is not specified, the default value "last" applies.
   The <par> element playback is complete when the media resource with
   the longest duration is complete.

4.3.1.1.3.1.  <seq>

   The <seq> element specifies media resources to be played back in
   sequence.  This allows a sequence of media resources to be played at
   the same time as other children of a <par> element are played in
   parallel, for example, a sequence of audio resources while a video
   resource is played in parallel.  This element is modeled after the
   <seq> element in SMIL [W3C.REC-SMIL2-20051213].

   The <seq> element has no attributes.

   The <seq> element has the following child elements (at least one, any
   order, multiple occurrences of each element permitted):

   <media>:  specifies a media resource (see Section 4.3.1.5) to play.
      The element is optional.

   <variable>:  specifies a variable media announcement (see
      Section 4.3.1.1.1) to play.  The element is optional.

   <dtmf>:  generates one or more DTMF tones (see Section 4.3.1.1.2) to
      play.  The element is optional.

   Playback of a <seq> element is complete when all child elements in
   the sequence are complete.  If the <seq> element is stopped by the
   <par> container, then playback of the current child element is
   stopped (remaining child elements in the sequence are not played).

   For example, a request to play a sequence of audio resources in
   parallel with a video media:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
   <dialogstart connectionid="c1">
     <dialog>
      <prompt>
       <par endsync="first">
        <seq>
          <media type="audio/x-wav"
               loc="http://www.example.com/media/date.wav"/>
          <media type="audio/x-wav"
               loc="http://www.example.com/media/intro.wav"/>
          <media type="audio/x-wav"
               loc="http://www.example.com/media/main.wav"/>
          <media type="audio/x-wav"
               loc="http://www.example.com/media/end.wav"/>
        </seq>
        <media type="video/3gpp;codecs='s263'"
               loc="rtsp://www.example.com/media/camera.3gp"/>
       </par>
      </prompt>
     </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   When the <prompt> element is executed, it begins playback of the
   <par> element containing a <seq> element and a video <media> element.
   The <seq> element itself contains a sequence of audio <media>
   elements.  Consequently, playback of the video media resource is
   initiated at the same time as playback of the sequence of the audio
   media resources is initiated.  Each audio resource is played back
   after the previous one completes.  Since the endsync attribute is set
   to "first", the <par> element playback is complete when either all
   the audio resources in <seq> have been played to completion or the
   video <media> is complete, whichever occurs first.

4.3.1.2.  <control>

   The <control> element defines how DTMF input is mapped to runtime
   controls, including prompt playback controls.





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 46]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   DTMF input matching these controls MUST NOT cause prompt playback to
   be interrupted (i.e., no prompt bargein), but causes the appropriate
   operation to be applied, for example, speeding up prompt playback.

   DTMF input matching these controls has priority over <collect> input
   for the duration of prompt playback.  If an incoming DTMF character
   matches a specified runtime control, then the DTMF character is
   consumed: it is not added to the digit buffer and so is not available
   to the <collect> operation.  Once prompt playback is complete,
   runtime controls are no longer active.

   The <control> element has the following attributes:

   gotostartkey:  maps a DTMF key to skip directly to the start of the
      prompt.  A valid value is a DTMF character (see Section 4.6.2).
      The attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   gotoendkey:  maps a DTMF key to skip directly to the end of the
      prompt.  A valid value is a DTMF character (see Section 4.6.2).
      The attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   skipinterval:  indicates how far an MS skips backwards or forwards
      through prompt playback when the rewind (rwkey) of fast forward
      key (ffkey) is pressed.  A valid value is a Time Designation (see
      Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      6s.

   ffkey:  maps a DTMF key to a fast forward operation equal to the
      value of 'skipinterval'.  A valid value is a DTMF character (see
      Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.  There is no default
      value.

   rwkey:  maps a DTMF key to a rewind operation equal to the value of
      'skipinterval'.  A valid value is a DTMF character (see
      Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.  There is no default
      value.

   pauseinterval:  indicates how long an MS pauses prompt playback when
      the pausekey is pressed.  A valid value is a Time Designation (see
      Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      10s.

   pausekey:  maps a DTMF key to a pause operation equal to the value of
      'pauseinterval'.  A valid value is a DTMF character (see
      Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.  There is no default
      value.

   resumekey:  maps a DTMF key to a resume operation.  A valid value is
      a DTMF character (see Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.
      There is no default value.

   volumeinterval:  indicates the increase or decrease in playback
      volume (relative to the current volume) when the volupkey or
      voldnkey is pressed.  A valid value is a percentage (see
      Section 4.6.8).  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      10%.

   volupkey:  maps a DTMF key to a volume increase operation equal to
      the value of 'volumeinterval'.  A valid value is a DTMF character
      (see Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.  There is no
      default value.

   voldnkey:  maps a DTMF key to a volume decrease operation equal to
      the value of 'volumeinterval'.  A valid value is a DTMF character
      (see Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.  There is no
      default value.

   speedinterval:  indicates the increase or decrease in playback speed
      (relative to the current speed) when the speedupkey or speeddnkey
      is pressed.  A valid value is a percentage (see Section 4.6.8).
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is 10%.

   speedupkey:  maps a DTMF key to a speed increase operation equal to
      the value of the speedinterval attribute.  A valid value is a DTMF
      character (see Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.  There
      is no default value.

   speeddnkey:  maps a DTMF key to a speed decrease operation equal to
      the value of the speedinterval attribute.  A valid value is a DTMF
      character (see Section 4.6.2).  The attribute is optional.  There
      is no default value.

   external:  allows one or more DTMF keys to be declared as external
      controls (for example, video camera controls); the MS can send
      notifications when a matching key is activated using <dtmfnotify>
      (Section 4.2.5.2).  A valid value is a DTMF string (see
      Section 4.6.3).  The attribute is optional.  There is no default
      value.

   If the same DTMF is specified in more than one DTMF key control
   attribute -- except the pausekey and resumekey attributes -- the MS
   sends a <response> with a 413 status code (Section 4.5).

   The MS has the following execution model for runtime control after
   initialization:



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 48]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   1.  If an error occurs during execution, then the MS terminates
       runtime control and the error is reported to the dialog
       container.  The MS MAY report controls executed successfully
       before the error in <controlinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.2).

   2.  Runtime controls are active only during prompt playback (if no
       <prompt> element is specified, then runtime controls are
       ignored).  If DTMF input matches any specified keys (for example,
       the ffkey), then the MS applies the appropriate operation
       immediately.  If a seek operation (ffkey, rwkey) attempts to go
       beyond the beginning or end of the prompt queue, then the MS
       automatically truncates it to the prompt queue beginning or end,
       respectively.  If a volume operation (voldnkey, volupkey)
       attempts to go beyond the minimum or maximum volume supported by
       the platform, then the MS automatically limits the operation to
       minimum or maximum supported volume, respectively.  If a speed
       operation (speeddnkey, speedupkey) attempts to go beyond the
       minimum or maximum playback speed supported by the platform, then
       the MS automatically limits the operation to minimum or maximum
       supported speed, respectively.  If the pause operation attempts
       to pause output when it is already paused, then the operation is
       ignored.  If the resume operation attempts to resume when the
       prompts are not paused, then the operation is ignored.  If a
       seek, volume, or speed operation is applied when output is
       paused, then the MS also resumes output automatically.

   3.  If DTMF control subscription has been specified for the dialog,
       then each DTMF match of a control operation is reported in a
       <dtmfnotify> notification event (Section 4.2.5.2).

   4.  When the dialog exits, all control matches are reported in a
       <controlinfo> element (Section 4.3.2.2).

4.3.1.3.  <collect>

   The <collect> element defines how DTMF input is collected.

   The <collect> element has the following attributes:

   cleardigitbuffer:  indicates whether the digit buffer is to be
      cleared.  A valid value is a boolean (see Section 4.6.1).  A value
      of true indicates that the digit buffer is to be cleared.  A value
      of false indicates that the digit buffer is not to be cleared.
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is true.

   timeout:  indicates the maximum time to wait for user input to begin.
      A valid value is a Time Designation (see Section 4.6.7).  The
      attribute is optional.  The default value is 5s.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 49]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   interdigittimeout:  indicates the maximum time to wait for another
      DTMF when the collected input is incomplete with respect to the
      grammar.  A valid value is a Time Designation (see Section 4.6.7).
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is 2s.

   termtimeout:  indicates the maximum time to wait for the termchar
      character when the collected input is complete with respect to the
      grammar.  A valid value is a Time Designation (see Section 4.6.7).
      The attribute is optional.  The default value is 0s (no delay).

   escapekey:  specifies a DTMF key that indicates collected grammar
      matches are discarded and the DTMF collection is to be re-
      initiated.  A valid value is a DTMF character (see Section 4.6.2).
      The attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   termchar:  specifies a DTMF character for terminating DTMF input
      collection using the internal grammar.  It is ignored when a
      custom grammar is specified.  A valid value is a DTMF character
      (see Section 4.6.2).  To disable termination by a conventional
      DTMF character, set the parameter to an unconventional character
      like 'A'.  The attribute is optional.  The default value is '#'.

   maxdigits:  The maximum number of digits to collect using an internal
      digits (0-9 only) grammar.  It is ignored when a custom grammar is
      specified.  A valid value is a positive integer (see
      Section 4.6.5).  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      5.

   The following matching priority is defined for incoming DTMF:
   termchar attribute, escapekey attribute, and then as part of a
   grammar.  For example, if "1" is defined as the escapekey attribute
   and as part of a grammar, then its interpretation as an escapekey
   takes priority.

   The <collect> element has the following child element:

   <grammar>:  indicates a custom grammar format (see
      Section 4.3.1.3.1).  The element is optional.

   The custom grammar takes priority over the internal grammar.  If a
   <grammar> element is specified, the MS MUST use it for DTMF
   collection.

   The MS has the following execution model for DTMF collection after
   initialization:

   1.  The DTMF collection buffer MUST NOT receive DTMF input matching
       <control> operations (see Section 4.3.1.2).



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 50]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   2.  If an error occurs during execution, then the MS terminates
       collection and reports the error to the dialog container (see
       Section 4.3).  The MS MAY report DTMF collected before the error
       in <collectinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.3).

   3.  The MS clears the digit buffer if the value of the
       cleardigitbuffer attribute is true.

   4.  The MS activates an initial timer with the duration of the value
       of the timeout attribute.  If the initial timer expires before
       any DTMF input is received, then collection execution terminates,
       the <collectinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.3) has the termmode
       attribute set to noinput and the execution status is reported to
       the dialog container.

   5.  When the first DTMF collect input is received, the initial timer
       is canceled and DTMF collection begins.  Each DTMF input is
       collected unless it matches the value of the escapekey attribute
       or the termchar attribute when the internal grammar is used.
       Collected input is matched against the grammar to determine if it
       is valid and, if valid, whether collection is complete.  Valid
       DTMF patterns are either a simple digit string where the maximum
       length is determined by the maxdigits attribute and that can be
       optionally terminated by the character in the termchar attribute,
       or a custom DTMF grammar specified with the <grammar> element.

   6.  After escapekey input, or a valid input that does not complete
       the grammar, the MS activates a timer for the value of the
       interdigittimeout attribute or the termtimeout attribute.  The MS
       only uses the termtimeout value when the grammar does not allow
       any additional input; otherwise, the MS uses the
       interdigittimeout.

   7.  If DTMF collect input matches the value of the escapekey
       attribute, then the MS re-initializes DTMF collection: i.e., the
       MS discards collected DTMFs already matched against the grammar,
       and the MS attempts to match incoming DTMF (including any pending
       in the digit buffer) as described in Step 5 above.

   8.  If the collect input is not valid with respect to the grammar or
       an interdigittimeout timer expires, the MS terminates collection
       execution and reports execution status to the dialog container
       with a <collectinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.3) where the termmode
       attribute is set to nomatch.

   9.  If the collect input completes the grammar or if a termtimeout
       timer expires, then the MS terminates collection execution and
       reports execution status to the dialog container with



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 51]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


       <collectinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.3) where the termmode attribute
       is set to match.

4.3.1.3.1.  <grammar>

   The <grammar> element allows a custom grammar, inline or external, to
   be specified.  Custom grammars permit the full range of DTMF
   characters including '*' and '#' to be specified for DTMF pattern
   matching.

   The <grammar> element has the following attributes:

   src:  specifies the location of an external grammar document.  A
      valid value is a URI (see Section 4.6.9).  The MS MUST support
      both HTTP [RFC2616] and HTTPS [RFC2818] schemes and the MS MAY
      support other schemes.  If the URI scheme is unsupported, the MS
      sends a <response> with a 420 status code (Section 4.5).  If the
      resource cannot be retrieved within the timeout interval, the MS
      sends a <response> with a 409 status code.  If the grammar format
      is not supported, the MS sends a <response> with a 424 status
      code.  The attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   type:  identifies the preferred type of the grammar document
      identified by the src attribute.  A valid value is a MIME media
      type (see Section 4.6.10).  If the URI scheme used in the src
      attribute defines a mechanism for establishing the authoritative
      MIME media type of the media resource, the value returned by that
      mechanism takes precedence over this attribute.  The attribute is
      optional.  There is no default value.

   fetchtimeout:  the maximum interval to wait when fetching a grammar
      resource.  A valid value is a Time Designation (see
      Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      30s.

   The <grammar> element allows inline grammars to be specified.  XML
   grammar formats MUST use a namespace other than the one used in this
   specification.  Non-XML grammar formats MAY use a CDATA section.

   The MS MUST support the Speech Recognition Grammar Specification
   [SRGS] XML grammar format ("application/srgs+xml") and MS MAY support
   the Key Press Markup Language (KPML) [RFC4730] or other grammar
   formats.  If the grammar format is not supported by the MS, then the
   MS sends a <response> with a 424 status code (Section 4.5).

   For example, the following fragment shows DTMF collection with an
   inline SRGS grammar:

4.3.1.4.  <record>

   The <record> element specifies how media input is recorded.

   The <record> element has the following attributes:

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   timeout:  indicates the time to wait for user input to begin.  A
      valid value is a Time Designation (see Section 4.6.7).  The
      attribute is optional.  The default value is 5s.

   vadinitial:  controls whether Voice Activity Detection (VAD) is used
      to initiate the recording operation.  A valid value is a boolean
      (see Section 4.6.1).  A value of true indicates the MS MUST
      initiate recording if the VAD detects voice on the configured
      inbound audio streams.  A value of false indicates that the MS
      MUST NOT initiate recording using VAD.  The attribute is optional.
      The default value is false.

   vadfinal:  controls whether VAD is used to terminate the recording
      operation.  A valid value is a boolean (see Section 4.6.1).  A
      value of true indicates the MS MUST terminate recording if the VAD
      detects a period of silence (whose duration is specified by the
      finalsilence attribute) on configured inbound audio streams.  A
      value of false indicates that the MS MUST NOT terminate recording
      using VAD.  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      false.

   dtmfterm:  indicates whether the recording operation is terminated by
      DTMF input.  A valid value is a boolean (see Section 4.6.1).  A
      value of true indicates that recording is terminated by DTMF
      input.  A value of false indicates that recording is not
      terminated by DTMF input.  The attribute is optional.  The default
      value is true.

   maxtime:  indicates the maximum duration of the recording.  A valid
      value is a Time Designation (see Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is
      optional.  The default value is 15s.

   beep:  indicates whether a 'beep' is to be played immediately prior
      to initiation of the recording operation.  A valid value is a
      boolean (see Section 4.6.1).  The attribute is optional.  The
      default value is false.

   finalsilence:  indicates the interval of silence that indicates the
      end of voice input.  This interval is not part of the recording
      itself.  This parameter is ignored if the vadfinal attribute has
      the value false.  A valid value is a Time Designation (see
      Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      5s.

   append:  indicates whether recorded data is appended or not to a
      recording location if a resource already exists.  A valid value is
      a boolean (see Section 4.6.1).  A value of true indicates that
      recorded data is appended to the existing resource at a recording



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 54]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


      location.  A value of false indicates that recorded data is to
      overwrite the existing resource.  The attribute is optional.  The
      default value is false.

      When a recording location is specified using the HTTP or HTTPS
      protocol, the recording operation SHOULD be performed using the
      HTTP GET and PUT methods, unless the HTTP server provides a
      special interface for recording uploads and appends (e.g., using
      POST).  When the append attribute has the value false, the
      recording data is uploaded to the specified location using HTTP
      PUT and replaces any data at that location on the HTTP origin
      server.  When append has the value true, the existing data (if
      any) is first downloaded from the specified location using HTTP
      GET, then the recording data is appended to the existing recording
      (note that this might require codec conversion and modification to
      the existing data), then the combined recording is uploaded to the
      specified location using HTTP PUT.  HTTP errors are handled as
      described in [RFC2616].

      When the recording location is specified using protocols other
      than HTTP or HTTPS, the mapping of the append operation onto the
      upload protocol scheme is implementation specific.

   If either the vadinitial or vadfinal attribute is set to true and the
   MS does not support VAD, the MS sends a <response> with a 434 status
   code (Section 4.5).

   The <record> element has the following child element (0 or more
   occurrences):

   <media>:  specifies the location and type of the media resource for
      uploading recorded data (see Section 4.3.1.5).  The MS MUST
      support both HTTP [RFC2616] and HTTPS [RFC2818] schemes for
      uploading recorded data and the MS MAY support other schemes.  The
      MS uploads recorded data to this resource as soon as possible
      after recording is complete.  The element is optional.

   If multiple <media> elements are specified, then media input is to be
   recorded in parallel to multiple resource locations.

   If no <media> child element is specified, the MS MUST record media
   input but the recording location and the recording format are
   implementation specific (e.g., the MS records audio in the WAV format
   to a local disk accessible by HTTP).  The recording location and
   format are reported in <recordinfo> (Section 4.3.2.4) when the dialog
   terminates.  The recording MUST be available from this location until
   the connection or conference associated with the dialog on the MS
   terminates.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 55]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   If the MS does not support the configuration required for recording
   from the input media streams to one or more <media> elements and a
   more specific error code is not defined for its child elements, the
   MS sends a <response> with a 423 status code (Section 4.5).

   Note that an MS MAY support uploading recorded data to recording
   locations at the same time the recording operation takes place.  Such
   implementations need to be aware of the requirements of certain
   recording formats (e.g., WAV) for metadata at the beginning of the
   uploaded file, that the finalsilence interval is not part of the
   recording and how these requirements interact with the URI scheme.

   The MS has the following execution model for recording after
   initialization:

   1.  If an error occurs during execution (e.g., authentication or
       communication error when trying to upload to a recording
       location), then the MS terminates record execution and reports
       the error to the dialog container (see Section 4.3).  The MS MAY
       report data recorded before the error in <recordinfo> (see
       Section 4.3.2.4).

   2.  If DTMF input (not matching a <control> operation) is received
       during prompt playback and the prompt bargein attribute is set to
       true, then the MS activates the record execution.  Otherwise, the
       MS activates it after the completion of prompt playback.

   3.  If a beep attribute with the value of true is specified, then the
       MS plays a beep tone.

   4.  The MS activates a timer with the duration of the value of the
       timeout attribute.  If the timer expires before the recording
       operation begins, then the MS terminates the recording execution
       and reports the status to dialog container with <recordinfo> (see
       Section 4.3.2.4) where the termmode attribute is set to noinput.

   5.  Initiation of the recording operation depends on the value of the
       vadinitial attribute.  If vadinitial has the value false, then
       the recording operation is initiated immediately.  Otherwise, the
       recording operation is initiated when voice activity is detected.

   6.  When the recording operation is initiated, a timer is started for
       the value of the maxtime attribute (maximum duration of the
       recording).  If the timer expires before the recording operation
       is complete, then the MS terminates recording execution and
       reports the execution status to the dialog container with
       <recordinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.4) where the termmode attribute
       set to maxtime.



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 56]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   7.  During the record operation input, media streams are recording to
       a location and format specified in one or more <media> child
       elements.  If no <media> child element is specified, the MS
       records input to an implementation-specific location and format.

   8.  If the dtmfterm attribute has the value true and DTMF input is
       detected during the record operation, then the MS terminates
       recording and its status is reported to the dialog container with
       a <recordinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.4) where the termmode attribute
       is set to dtmf.

   9.  If vadfinal attribute has the value true, then the MS terminates
       the recording operation when a period of silence, with the
       duration specified by the value of the finalsilence attribute, is
       detected.  This period of silence is not part of the final
       recording.  The status is reported to the dialog container with a
       <recordinfo> (see Section 4.3.2.4) where the termmode attribute
       is set to finalsilence.

   For example, a request to record audio and video input to separate
   locations:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
   <dialogstart connectionid="c1">

       <media type="video/3gpp;codecs='s263'"
           loc="http://www.example.com/upload/video.3gp"/>
      </record>
     </dialog>

   When the <record> element is executed, it immediately begins
   recording of the audio and video (since vadinitial is false) where
   the destination locations are specified in the <media> child
   elements.  Recording is completed when the duration reaches 30s or
   the connection is terminated.

4.3.1.5.  <media>

   The <media> element specifies a media resource to playback from (see
   Section 4.3.1.1) or record to (see Section 4.3.1.4).  In the playback
   case, the resource is retrieved and in the recording case, recording
   data is uploaded to the resource location.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   A <media> element has the following attributes:

   loc:  specifies the location of the media resource.  A valid value is
      a URI (see Section 4.6.9).  The MS MUST support both HTTP
      [RFC2616] and HTTPS [RFC2818] schemes and the MS MAY support other
      schemes.  If the URI scheme is not supported by the MS, the MS
      sends a <response> with a 420 status code (Section 4.5).  If the
      resource is to be retrieved but the MS cannot retrieve it within
      the timeout interval, the MS sends a <response> with a 409 status
      code.  If the format of the media resource is not supported, the
      MS sends a <response> with a 429 status code.  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   type:  specifies the type of the media resource indicated in the loc
      attribute.  A valid value is a MIME media type (see
      Section 4.6.10) that, depending on its definition, can include
      additional parameters (e.g., [RFC4281]).  If the URI scheme used
      in the loc attribute defines a mechanism for establishing the
      authoratitive MIME media type of the media resource, the value
      returned by that mechanism takes precedence over this attribute.
      If additional media parameters are specified, the MS MUST use them
      to determine media processing.  For example, [RFC4281] defines a
      'codec' parameter for media types like video/3gpp that would
      determine which media streams are played or recorded.  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   fetchtimeout:  the maximum interval to wait when fetching a media
      resource.  A valid value is a Time Designation (see
      Section 4.6.7).  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      30s.

   soundLevel:  playback soundLevel (volume) for the media resource.  A
      valid value is a percentage (see Section 4.6.8).  The value
      indicates increase or decrease relative to the original recorded
      volume of the media.  A value of 100% (the default) plays the
      media at its recorded volume, a value of 200% will play the media
      twice recorded volume, 50% at half its recorded volume, a value of
      0% will play the media silently, and so on.  See 'soundLevel' in
      SMIL [W3C.REC-SMIL2-20051213] for further information.  The
      attribute is optional.  The default value is 100%.

   clipBegin:  offset from start of media resource to begin playback.  A
      valid value is a Time Designation (see Section 4.6.7).  The offset
      is measured in normal media playback time from the beginning of
      the media resource.  If the clipBegin offset is after the end of
      media (or the clipEnd offset), no media is played.  See
      'clipBegin' in SMIL [W3C.REC-SMIL2-20051213] for further
      information.  The attribute is optional.  The default value is 0s.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   clipEnd:  offset from start of media resource to end playback.  A
      valid value is a Time Designation (see Section 4.6.7).  The offset
      is measured in normal media playback time from the beginning of
      the media resource.  If the clipEnd offset is after the end of
      media, then the media is played to the end.  If clipBegin is after
      clipEnd, then no media is played.  See 'clipEnd' in SMIL
      [W3C.REC-SMIL2-20051213] for further information.  The attribute
      is optional.  There is no default value.

   The fetchtimeout, soundLevel, clipBegin, and clipEnd attributes are
   only relevant in the playback use case.  The MS ignores these
   attributes when using the <media> for recording.

   The <media> element has no children.

4.3.2.  Exit Information

   When the dialog exits, information about the specified operations is
   reported in a <dialogexit> notification event (Section 4.2.5.1).

4.3.2.1.  <promptinfo>

   The <promptinfo> element reports the information about prompt
   execution.  It has the following attributes:

   duration:  indicates the duration of prompt playback in milliseconds.
      A valid value is a non-negative integer (see Section 4.6.4).  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   termmode:  indicates how playback was terminated.  Valid values are
      'stopped', 'completed', or 'bargein'.  The attribute is mandatory.

   The <promptinfo> element has no child elements.

4.3.2.2.  <controlinfo>

   The <controlinfo> element reports information about control
   execution.

   The <controlinfo> element has no attributes and has 0 or more
   <controlmatch> child elements each describing an individual runtime
   control match.

4.3.2.2.1.  <controlmatch>

   The <controlmatch> element has the following attributes:





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 59]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   dtmf:  DTMF input triggering the runtime control.  A valid value is a
      DTMF string (see Section 4.6.3) with no space between characters.
      The attribute is mandatory.

   timestamp:  indicates the time (on the MS) at which the control was
      triggered.  A valid value is a dateTime expression
      (Section 4.6.12).  The attribute is mandatory.

   The <controlmatch> element has no child elements.

4.3.2.3.  <collectinfo>

   The <collectinfo> element reports the information about collect
   execution.

   The <collectinfo> element has the following attributes:

   dtmf:  DTMF input collected from the user.  A valid value is a DTMF
      string (see Section 4.6.3) with no space between characters.  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   termmode:  indicates how collection was terminated.  Valid values are
      'stopped', 'match', 'noinput', or 'nomatch'.  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   The <collectinfo> element has no child elements.

4.3.2.4.  <recordinfo>

   The <recordinfo> element reports information about record execution
   (Section 4.3.1.4).

   The <recordinfo> element has the following attributes:

   termmode:  indicates how recording was terminated.  Valid values are
      'stopped', 'noinput', 'dtmf', 'maxtime', and 'finalsilence'.  The
      attribute is mandatory.

   duration:  indicates the duration of the recording in milliseconds.
      A valid value is a non-negative integer (see Section 4.6.4).  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

   The <recordinfo> element has the following child element (0 or more
   occurrences):

   <mediainfo>:  indicates information about a recorded media resource
      (see Section 4.3.2.4.1).  The element is optional.




McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 60]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   When the record operation is successful, the MS MUST specify a
   <mediainfo> element for each recording location.  For example, if the
   <record> element contained three <media> child elements, then the
   <recordinfo> would contain three <mediainfo> child elements.

4.3.2.4.1.  <mediainfo>

   The <mediainfo> element reports information about a recorded media
   resource.

   The <mediainfo> element has the following attributes:

   loc:  indicates the location of the media resource.  A valid value is
      a URI (see Section 4.6.9).  The attribute is mandatory.

   type:  indicates the format of the media resource.  A valid value is
      a MIME media type (see Section 4.6.10).  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   size:  indicates the size of the media resource in bytes.  A valid
      value is a non-negative integer (see Section 4.6.4).  The
      attribute is optional.  There is no default value.

4.4.  Audit Elements

   The audit elements defined in this section allow the MS to be audited
   for package capabilities as well as dialogs managed by the package.
   Auditing is particularly important for two use cases.  First, it
   enables discovery of package capabilities supported on an MS before
   an AS starts a dialog on connection or conference.  The AS can then
   use this information to create request elements using supported
   capabilities and, in the case of codecs, to negotiate an appropriate
   SDP for a User Agent's connection.  Second, auditing enables
   discovery of the existence and status of dialogs currently managed by
   the package on the MS.  This could be used when one AS takes over
   management of the dialogs if the AS that initiated the dialogs fails
   or is no longer available (see Security Considerations described in
   Section 7).

4.4.1.  <audit>

   The <audit> request element is sent to the MS to request information
   about the capabilities of, and dialogs currently managed with, this
   Control Package.  Capabilities include supported dialog languages,
   grammar formats, record and media types, as well as codecs.  Dialog
   information includes the status of managed dialogs as well as codecs.

   The <audit> element has the following attributes:



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 61]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   capabilities:  indicates whether package capabilities are to be
      audited.  A valid value is a boolean (see Section 4.6.1).  A value
      of true indicates that capability information is to be reported.
      A value of false indicates that capability information is not to
      be reported.  The attribute is optional.  The default value is
      true.

   dialogs:  indicates whether dialogs currently managed by the package
      are to be audited.  A valid value is a boolean (see
      Section 4.6.1).  A value of true indicates that dialog information
      is to be reported.  A value of false indicates that dialog
      information is not to be reported.  The attribute is optional.
      The default value is true.

   dialogid:  string identifying a specific dialog to audit.  The MS
      sends a response with a 406 status code (Section 4.5) if the
      specified dialog identifier is invalid.  The attribute is
      optional.  There is no default value.

   If the dialogs attribute has the value true and dialogid attribute is
   specified, then only audit information about the specified dialog is
   reported.  If the dialogs attribute has the value false, then no
   dialog audit information is reported even if a dialogid attribute is
   specified.

   The <audit> element has no child elements.

   When the MS receives an <audit> request, it MUST reply with an
   <auditresponse> element (Section 4.4.2), which includes a mandatory
   attribute describing the status in terms of a numeric code.  Response
   status codes are defined in Section 4.5.  If the request is
   successful, the <auditresponse> contains (depending on attribute
   values) a <capabilities> element (Section 4.4.2.2) reporting package
   capabilities and a <dialogs> element (Section 4.4.2.3) reporting
   managed dialog information.  If the MS is not able to process the
   request and carry out the audit operation, the audit request has
   failed and the MS MUST indicate the class of failure using an
   appropriate 4xx response code.  Unless an error response code is
   specified for a class of error within this section, implementations
   follow Section 4.5 in determining the appropriate status code for the
   response.

   For example, a request to audit capabilities and dialogs managed by
   the package:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
     <audit/>
   </mscivr>



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 62]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   In this example, only capabilities are to be audited:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
     <audit dialogs="false"/>
   </mscivr>

   With this example, only a specific dialog is to be audited:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
     <audit capabilities="false" dialogid="d4"/>
   </mscivr>

4.4.2.  <auditresponse>

   The <auditresponse> element describes a response to an <audit>
   request.

   The <auditresponse> element has the following attributes:

   status:  numeric code indicating the audit response status.  The
      attribute is mandatory.  Valid values are defined in Section 4.5.

   reason:  string specifying a reason for the status.  The attribute is
      optional.

   desclang:  specifies the language used in the value of the reason
      attribute.  A valid value is a language identifier
      (Section 4.6.11).  The attribute is optional.  If not specified,
      the value of the desclang attribute on <mscivr> (Section 4.1)
      applies.

   The <auditresponse> element has the following sequence of child
   elements:

   <capabilities>  element (Section 4.4.2.2) describing capabilities of
      the package.  The element is optional.

   <dialogs>  element (Section 4.4.2.3) describing information about
      managed dialogs.  The element is optional.

   For example, a successful response to an <audit> request requesting
   capabilities and dialogs information:

      <subtype>telephone-event</subtype>
     </codec>
   </codecs>

4.4.2.1.1.  <codec>

   The <codec> element describes a codec on the MS.  The element is
   modeled on the <codec> element in the XCON conference information
   data model [XCON-DATA-MODEL] but allows addition information (e.g.,
   rate, speed, etc.) to be specified.

   The <codec> element has the following attributes:

     <codec name="audio">
      <subtype>telephone-event</subtype>
     </codec>
    </codecs>
   </dialogaudit>

4.5.  Response Status Codes

   This section describes the response codes in Table 1 for the status
   attribute of dialog management <response> (Section 4.2.4) and audit
   <auditresponse> (Section 4.4.2) responses.  The MS MUST support the
   status response codes defined here.  All other valid but undefined
   values are reserved for future use, where new status codes are
   assigned using the Standards Action process defined in [RFC5226].
   The AS MUST treat any responses it does not recognize as being
   equivalent to the x00 response code for all classes.  For example, if



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                   [Page 71]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   an AS receives an unrecognized response code of 499, it can safely
   assume that there was something wrong with its request and treat the
   response as if it had received a 400 (Syntax error) response code.

   4xx responses are definite failure responses from a particular MS.
   The reason attribute in the response SHOULD identify the failure in
   more detail, for example, "Mandatory attribute missing: src in media
   element" for a 400 (Syntax error) response code.

   The AS SHOULD NOT retry the same request without modification (for
   example, correcting a syntax error or changing the connectionid to
   use one available on the MS).  However, the same request to a
   different MS might be successful, for example, if another MS supports
   a capability required in the request.

   4xx failure responses can be grouped into three classes: failure due
   to a syntax error in the request (400); failure due to an error
   executing the request on the MS (405-419); and failure due to the
   request requiring a capability not supported by the MS (420-439).

   In cases where more than one request code could be reported for a
   failure, the MS SHOULD use the most specific error code of the
   failure class for the detected error.  For example, if the MS detects
   that the dialogid in the request is invalid, then it uses a 406
   status code.  However, if the MS merely detects that an execution
   error occurred, then 419 is used.

                           Table 1: Status Codes

4.6.  Type Definitions

   This section defines types referenced in attribute and element
   definitions.

4.6.1.  Boolean

   The value space of boolean is the set {true, false, 1, 0} as defined
   in Section 3.2.2 of [XMLSchema:Part2].  In accordance with this
   definition, the concept of false can be lexically represented by the
   strings "0" and "false" and the concept of true by the strings "1"
   and "true"; implementations MUST support both styles of lexical
   representation.

4.6.2.  DTMFChar

   A DTMF character.  The value space is the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
   7, 8, 9, #, *, A, B, C, D}.

4.6.3.  DTMFString

   A string composed of one or more DTMFChars.

4.6.4.  Non-Negative Integer

   The value space of non-negative integer is the infinite set
   {0,1,2,...} as defined in Section 3.3.20 of [XMLSchema:Part2].

   Implementation Note: It is RECOMMENDED that implementations at least
   support a maximum value of a 32-bit integer (2,147,483,647).

4.6.5.  Positive Integer

   The value space of positive integer is the infinite set {1,2,...} as
   defined in Section 3.3.25 of [XMLSchema:Part2].

   Implementation Note: It is RECOMMENDED that implementations at least
   support a maximum value of a 32-bit integer (2,147,483,647).

4.6.6.  String

   A string in the character encoding associated with the XML element as
   defined in Section 3.2.1 of [XMLSchema:Part2].

4.6.7.  Time Designation

   A time designation consists of a non-negative real number followed by
   a time unit identifier.

   The time unit identifiers are "ms" (milliseconds) and "s" (seconds).

   Examples include: "3s", "850ms", "0.7s", ".5s", and "+1.5s".

4.6.8.  Percentage

   A percentage consists of a positive integer followed by "%".

   Examples include: "100%", "500%", and "10%".

4.6.9.  URI

   Uniform Resource Indicator as defined in [RFC3986].

4.6.10.  MIME Media Type

   A string formatted as an IANA MIME media type [MIME.mediatypes].  The
   ABNF [RFC5234] production for the string is:

   type = type-name "/" subtype-name *(";" parameter)

   parameter = parameter-name "=" value

   where "type-name" and "subtype-name" are defined in Section 4.2 of
   [RFC4288], "parameter-name" is defined in Section 4.3 of [RFC4288],
   and "value" is defined in Section 5.1 of [RFC2045].

4.6.11.  Language Identifier

   A language identifier labels information content as being of a
   particular human language variant.  Following the XML specification
   for language identification [XML], a legal language identifier is
   identified by a [RFC5646] code and matched according to [RFC4647].

4.6.12.  DateTime

   A string formatted according to the XML schema definition of a
   dateTime type [XMLSchema:Part2].

5.  Formal Syntax

   This section defines the XML schema for IVR Control Package.  The
   schema is normative.

   The schema defines datatypes, attributes, dialog management, and IVR
   dialog elements in the urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr namespace.  In
   most elements the order of child elements is significant.  The schema
   is extensible: elements allow attributes and child elements from
   other namespaces.  Elements from outside this package's namespace can
   occur after elements defined in this package.

   The schema is dependent upon the schema (framework.xsd) defined in
   Appendix A.1 of the Control Framework [RFC6230].  It is also
   dependent upon the W3C (xml.xsd) schema for definitions of XML
   attributes (e.g., xml:base).

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsd:schema targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr"
 elementFormDefault="qualified" blockDefault="#all"
 xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr"

 <xsd:annotation>
  <xsd:documentation>
   IETF MediaCtrl IVR 1.0 (20110104)

   This is the schema of the IETF MediaCtrl IVR Control
   Package.

   The schema namespace is urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr

6.  Examples

   This section provides examples of the IVR Control Package.

6.1.  AS-MS Dialog Interaction Examples

   The following example assume a Control Channel has been established
   and synced as described in the Media Control Channel Framework
   [RFC6230].

   The XML messages are in angled brackets (with the root <mscivr>
   omitted); the REPORT status is in round brackets.  Other aspects of
   the protocol are omitted for readability.

6.1.1.  Starting an IVR Dialog

   An IVR dialog is started successfully, and dialogexit notification
   <event> is sent from the MS to the AS when the dialog exits normally.

6.1.4.  Terminating a Dialog

   An IVR dialog is started successfully, and then terminated by the AS.
   The dialogexit event is sent to the AS when the dialog exits.

             Application Server (AS)                   Media Server (MS)

                |                                             |

   Note that in (6) the <response> payload to the <dialogterminate/>
   request is carried on a framework 200 response since it could
   complete the requested operation before the transaction timeout.

6.2.  IVR Dialog Examples

   The following examples show how <dialog> is used with
   <dialogprepare>, <dialogstart>, and <event> elements to play prompts,
   set runtime controls, collect DTMF input, and record user input.

   The examples do not specify all messages between the AS and MS.

6.2.1.  Playing Announcements

   This example prepares an announcement composed of two prompts where
   the dialog repeatCount is set to 2.

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
   <dialogprepare>
      <dialog repeatCount="2">
       <prompt>
         <media loc="http://www.example.com/media/Number_09.wav"/>
         <media loc="http://www.example.com/media/Number_11.wav"/>
       </prompt>
      </dialog>
   </dialogprepare>
   </mscivr>

   If the dialog is prepared successfully, a <response> is returned with
   status 200 and a dialog identifier assigned by the MS:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
     <response status="200" dialogid="vxi78"/>
   </mscivr>

   The prepared dialog is then started on a conference playing the
   prompts twice:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart prepareddialogid="vxi78" conferenceid="conference11"/>
   </mscivr>

   In the case of a successful dialog, the output is provided in
   <event>; for example:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="vxi78">
       <dialogexit status="1">
          <promptinfo termmode="completed" duration="24000"/>
       </dialogexit>
    </event>
   </mscivr>

6.2.2.  Prompt and Collect

   In this example, a prompt is played and then the MS waits for 30s for
   a two digit sequence:






McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 109]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <dialog>
     <prompt>
      <media loc="http://www.example.com/prompt1.wav"/>
     </prompt>
     <collect timeout="30s" maxdigits="2"/>
    </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   If no user input is collected within 30s, then the following
   notification event would be returned:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="vxi81">
       <dialogexit status="1" >
          <promptinfo termmode="completed" duration="4000"/>
          <collectinfo termmode="noinput"/>
       </dialogexit>
    </event>
   </mscivr>

   The collect operation can be specified without a prompt.  Here the MS
   just waits for DTMF input from the user (the maxdigits attribute of
   <collect> defaults to 5):

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
     <dialog>
      <collect/>
     </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   If the dialog is successful, then dialogexit <event> contains the
   dtmf collected in its result parameter:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="vxi80">
       <dialogexit status="1">
          <collectinfo dtmf="12345" termmode="match"/>
       </dialogexit>
    </event>
   </mscivr>

   And finally, in this example, one of the input parameters is invalid:




McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 110]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
   <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <dialog repeatCount="two">
      <prompt>
        <media loc="http://www.example.com/prompt1.wav"/>
      </prompt>
      <collect cleardigitbuffer="true"
      timeout="4s" interdigittimeout="2s"
      termtimeout="0s" maxdigits="2"/>
    </dialog>
   </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   The error is reported in the response:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <response status="400" dialogid="vxi82"
     reason="repeatCount attribute value invalid: two"/>
   </mscivr>

6.2.3.  Prompt and Record

   In this example, the user is prompted, then their input is recorded
   for a maximum of 30 seconds.

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
   <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
       <dialog>
         <prompt>
          <media loc="http://www.example.com/media/sayname.wav"/>
         </prompt>
         <record dtmfterm="false" maxtime="30s" beep="true"/>
       </dialog>
   </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   If successful and the recording is terminated by DTMF, the following
   is returned in a dialogexit <event>:













McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 111]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="vxi83">
     <dialogexit status="1">
      <recordinfo termmode="dtmf">
       <mediainfo type="audio/x-wav"
         loc="http://www.example.com/recording1.wav"/>
      </recordinfo>
     </dialogexit>
    </event>
   </mscivr>

6.2.4.  Runtime Controls

   In this example, a prompt is played with the collect operation and
   runtime controls activated.

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <dialog>
     <prompt bargein="true">
      <media loc="http://www.example.com/prompt1.wav"/>
     </prompt>
     <control ffkey="5" rwkey="6" speedupkey="3"
              speeddnkey="4"/>
     <collect maxdigits="2"/>
    </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   Once the dialog is active, the user can press keys 3, 4, 5, and 6 to
   execute runtime controls on the prompt queue.  The keys do not cause
   bargein to occur.  If the user presses any other key, then the prompt
   is interrupted and DTMF collect begins.  Note that runtime controls
   are not active during the collect operation.

   When the dialog is completed successfully, then both control and
   collect information is reported.

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="vxi81">
       <dialogexit status="1">
          <promptinfo termmode="bargein"/>
          <controlinfo>
           <controlmatch dtmf="4" timestamp="2008-05-12T12:13:14Z"/>
           <controlmatch dtmf="3" timestamp="2008-05-12T12:13:15Z"/>
           <controlmatch dtmf="5" timestamp="2008-05-12T12:13:16Z"/>
          </controlinfo>
          <collectinfo termmode="match" dtmf="14"/>
       </dialogexit>
    </event>
   </mscivr>

6.2.5.  Subscriptions and Notifications

   In this example, a looped dialog is started with subscription for
   notifications each time the user input matches the collect grammar:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS">
     <dialog repeatCount="0">
      <collect maxdigits="2"/>
     </dialog>
     <subscribe>
      <dtmfsub matchmode="collect"/>
     </subscribe>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   Each time the user input the DTMF matching the grammar, the following
   notification event would be sent:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="vxi81">
       <dtmfnotify matchmode="collect" dtmf="12"
        timestamp="2008-05-12T12:13:14Z"/>
    </event>
   </mscivr>

   If no user input was provided, or the input did not match the
   grammar, the dialog would continue to loop until terminated (or an
   error occurred).

6.2.6.  Dialog Repetition until DTMF Collection Complete

   This example is a prompt and collect dialog to collect the PIN from
   the user.  The repeatUntilComplete attribute in the <dialog> is set



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 113]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   to true in this case so that when the grammar collection is complete,
   the MS automatically terminates the dialog repeat cycle and reports
   the results in a <dialogexit> event.

      <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
       <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS">
        <dialog repeatCount="3" repeatUntilComplete="true">
         <prompt bargein="true">
           <media loc="http://example.com/please_enter_your_pin.vox"/>
         </prompt>
         <collect maxdigits="4"/>
        </dialog>
       </dialogstart>
      </mscivr>

   If the user barges in on the prompt and <collect> receives DTMF input
   matching the grammar, the dialog cycle is considered complete and the
   MS returns the following:

      <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
       <event dialogid="vxi81">
         <dialogexit status="1">
           <promptinfo duration="3654" termmode="bargein"/>
           <collectinfo dtmf="1234" termmode="match"/>
         </dialogexit>
       </event>
      </mscivr>

   If no user input was provided, or the input did not match the
   grammar, the dialog would loop for a maximum of 3 times.

6.3.  Other Dialog Languages

   The following example requests that a VoiceXML dialog is started:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart dialogid="d2"
                 connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS"
                 type="application/voicexml+xml"
                 src="http://www.example.com/mydialog.vxml"
                 fetchtimeout="15s">
     <params>
      <param name="prompt1">nfs://nas01/media1.3gp</param>
      <param name="prompt2">nfs://nas01/media2.3gp</param>
     </params>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>




McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 114]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   If the MS does not support this dialog language, then the response
   would have the status code 421 (Section 4.5).  However, if it does
   support the VoiceXML dialog language, it would respond with a 200
   status, activate the VoiceXML dialog, and make the <params> available
   to the VoiceXML script as described in Section 9.

   When the VoiceXML dialog exits, exit namelist parameters are
   specified using <params> in the dialogexit event:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <event dialogid="d2">
      <dialogexit status="1">
       <params>
        <param name="username">peter</param>
        <param name="pin">1234</param>
       </params>
      </dialogexit>
     </event>
   </mscivr>

6.4.  Foreign Namespace Attributes and Elements

   An MS can support attributes and elements from foreign namespaces
   within the <mscivr> element.  For example, the MS could support a
   <listen> element (in a foreign namespace) for speech recognition by
   analogy to how <collect> supports DTMF collection.

   In the following example, a prompt and collect request is extended
   with a <listen> element:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr"
    xmlns:ex="http://www.example.com/mediactrl/extensions/1">
    <dialogstart connectionid="7HDY839:HJKSkyHS~HUwkuh7ns">
    <dialog>
     <prompt>
      <media loc="http://www.example.com/prompt1.wav"/>
     </prompt>
     <collect timeout="30s" maxdigits="4"/>
     <ex:listen maxtimeout="30s" >
       <ex:grammar src="http://example.org/pin.grxml"/>
     </ex:listen>
    </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   In the <mscivr> root element, the xmlns:ex attribute declares that
   "ex" is associated with the foreign namespace URI
   "http://www.example.com/mediactrl/extensions/1".  The <ex:listen>,



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 115]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   its attributes, and child elements are associated with this
   namespace.  This <listen> could be defined so that it activates an
   SRGS grammar and listens for user input matching the grammar in a
   similar manner to DTMF collection.

   If an MS receives this request but does not support the <listen>
   element, then it would send a 431 response:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <response status="431" dialogid="d560"
     reason="unsupported foreign listen element"/>
   </mscivr>

   If the MS does support this foreign element, it would send a 200
   response and start the dialog with speech recognition.  When the
   dialog exits, it provides information about the <listen> execution
   within <dialogexit>, again using elements in a foreign namespace such
   as <listeninfo> below:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr"
    xmlns:ex="http://www.example.com/mediactrl/extensions/1">

       <ex:listeninfo speech="1 2 3 4" termmode="match"/>
      </dialogexit>
     </event>
   </mscivr>

   Note that in reply the AS sends a Control Framework 200 response even
   though the notification event contains an element in a foreign
   namespace that it might not understand.

7.  Security Considerations

   As this Control Package processes XML markup, implementations MUST
   address the security considerations of [RFC3023].

   Implementations of this Control Package MUST address security,
   confidentiality, and integrity of messages transported over the
   Control Channel as described in Section 12 of "Media Control Channel
   Framework" [RFC6230], including Transport Level Protection, Control
   Channel Policy Management, and Session Establishment.  In addition,
   implementations MUST address security, confidentiality, and integrity
   of User Agent sessions with the MS, both in terms of SIP signaling
   and associated RTP media flow; see [RFC6230] for further details on
   this topic.  Finally, implementations MUST address security,





McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 116]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   confidentiality, and integrity of sessions where, following a URI
   scheme, an MS uploads recordings or retrieves documents and resources
   (e.g., fetching a grammar document from a web server using HTTPS).

   Adequate transport protection and authentication are critical,
   especially when the implementation is deployed in open networks.  If
   the implementation fails to correctly address these issues, it risks
   exposure to malicious attacks, including (but not limited to):

   Denial of Service:  An attacker could insert a request message into
      the transport stream causing specific dialogs on the MS to be
      terminated immediately.  For example, <dialogterminate
      dialogid="XXXX" immediate="true">, where the value of "XXXX" could
      be guessed or discovered by auditing active dialogs on the MS
      using an <audit> request.  Likewise, an attacker could impersonate
      the MS and insert error responses into the transport stream so
      denying the AS access to package capabilities.

   Resource Exhaustion:  An attacker could insert into the Control
      Channel new request messages (or modify existing ones) with, for
      instance, <dialogprepare> elements with a very long fetchtimeout
      attribute and a bogus source URL.  At some point, this will
      exhaust the number of connections that the MS is able to make.

   Phishing:  An attacker with access to the Control Channel could
      modify the "loc" attribute of the <media> element in a dialog to
      point to some other audio file that had different information from
      the original.  This modified file could include a different phone
      number for people to call if they want more information or need to
      provide additional information (such as governmental, corporate,
      or financial information).

   Data Theft:  An attacker could modify a <record> element in the
      Control Channel so as to add a new recording location:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart>
     <dialog>
      <record>
         <media type="audio/x-wav" loc="(Good URI)"/>
         <media type="audio/x-wav" loc="(Attacker's URI)"/>
      </record>
     </dialog>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>






McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 117]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   The recorded data would be uploaded to two locations indicated by the
   "{Good URI}" and the "{Attacker's URI}".  This allows the attacker to
   steal the recorded audio (which could include sensitive or
   confidential information) without the originator of the request
   necessarily being aware of the theft.

   The Media Control Channel Framework permits additional security
   policy management, including resource access and Control Channel
   usage, to be specified at the Control Package level beyond that
   specified for the Media Control Channel Framework (see Section 12.3
   of [RFC6230]).

   Since creation of IVR dialogs is associated with media processing
   resources (e.g., DTMF detectors, media playback and recording, etc.)
   on the MS, the security policy for this Control Package needs to
   address how such dialogs are securely managed across more than one
   Control Channel.  Such a security policy is only useful for secure,
   confidential, and integrity-protected channels.  The identity of
   Control Channels is determined by the channel identifier, i.e., the
   value of the cfw-id attribute in the SDP and 'Dialog-ID' header in
   the channel protocol (see [RFC6230]).  Channels are the same if they
   have the same identifier; otherwise, they are different.  This
   Control Package imposes the following additional security policies:

   Responses:  The MS MUST only send a response to a dialog management
      or audit request using the same Control Channel as the one used to
      send the request.

   Notifications:  The MS MUST only send notification events for a
      dialog using the same Control Channel as it received the request
      creating the dialog.

   Auditing:  The MS MUST only provide audit information about dialogs
      that have been created on the same Control Channel as the one upon
      the <audit> request is sent.

   Rejection:  The MS SHOULD reject requests to audit or manipulate an
      existing dialog on the MS if the channel is not the same as the
      one used when the dialog was created.  The MS rejects a request by
      sending a Control Framework 403 response (see Section 7.4 and
      Section 12.3 of [RFC6230]).  For example, if a channel with
      identifier 'cfw1234' has been used to send a request to create a
      particular dialog and the MS receives on channel 'cfw98969' a
      request to audit or terminate the dialog, then the MS sends a 403
      framework response.






McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 118]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   There can be valid reasons why an implementation does not reject an
   audit or dialog manipulation request on a different channel from the
   one that created the dialog.  For example, a system administrator
   might require a separate channel to audit dialog resources created by
   system users and to terminate dialogs consuming excessive system
   resources.  Alternatively, a system monitor or resource broker might
   require a separate channel to audit dialogs managed by this package
   on an MS.  However, the full implications need to be understood by
   the implementation and carefully weighted before accepting these
   reasons as valid.  If the reasons are not valid in their particular
   circumstances, the MS rejects such requests.

   There can also be valid reasons for 'channel handover' including high
   availability support or where one AS needs to take over management of
   dialogs after the AS that created them has failed.  This could be
   achieved by the Control Channels using the same channel identifier,
   one after another.  For example, assume a channel is created with the
   identifier 'cfw1234' and the channel is used to create dialogs on the
   MS.  This channel (and associated SIP dialog) then terminates due to
   a failure on the AS.  As permitted by the Control Framework, the
   channel identifier 'cfw1234' could then be reused so that another
   channel is created with the same identifier 'cfw1234', allowing it to
   'take over' management of the dialogs on the MS.  Again, the
   implementation needs to understand the full implications and
   carefully weight them before accepting these reasons as valid.  If
   the reasons are not valid for their particular circumstances, the MS
   uses the appropriate SIP mechanisms to prevent session establishment
   when the same channel identifier is used in setting up another
   Control Channel (see Section 4 of [RFC6230]).

9.  Using VoiceXML as a Dialog Language

   The IVR Control Package allows, but does not require, the MS to
   support other dialog languages by referencing an external dialog
   document.  This section provides MS implementations that support the
   VoiceXML dialog language ([VXML20], [VXML21], [VXML30]) with
   additional details about using these dialogs in this package.  This
   section is normative for an MS that supports the VoiceXML dialog
   language.

   This section covers preparing (Section 9.1), starting (Section 9.2),
   terminating (Section 9.3), and exiting (Section 9.4) VoiceXML dialogs
   as well as handling VoiceXML call transfer (Section 9.5).

9.1.  Preparing a VoiceXML Dialog

   A VoiceXML dialog is prepared by sending the MS a request containing
   a <dialogprepare> element (Section 4.2.1).  The type attribute is set
   to "application/voicexml+xml" and the src attribute to the URI of the
   VoiceXML document that is to be prepared by the MS.  For example:







McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 122]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogprepare type="application/voicexml+xml"
                   src="http://www.example.com/mydialog.vxml"
                   fetchtimeout="15s"/>
   </mscivr>

   The VoiceXML dialog environment uses the <dialogprepare> request as
   an opportunity to fetch and validate the initial document indicated
   by the src attribute along with any resources referenced in the
   VoiceXML document marked as prefetchable.  The maxage and maxstale
   attributes, if specified, control how the initial VoiceXML document
   is fetched using HTTP (see [RFC2616]).  Note that the fetchtimeout
   attribute is not defined in VoiceXML for an initial document, but the
   MS MUST support this attribute in its VoiceXML environment.

   If a <params> child element of <dialogprepare> is specified, then the
   MS MUST map the parameter information into a VoiceXML session
   variable object as described in Section 9.2.3.

   The success or failure of the VoiceXML document preparation is
   reported in the MS response.  For example, if the VoiceXML document
   cannot be retrieved, then a 409 error response is returned.  If the
   document is syntactically invalid according to VoiceXML, then a 400
   response is returned.  If successful, the response includes a
   dialogid attribute whose value the AS can use in <dialogstart>
   element to start the prepared dialog.

9.2.  Starting a VoiceXML Dialog

   A VoiceXML dialog is started by sending the MS a request containing a
   <dialogstart> element (Section 4.2.2).  If a VoiceXML dialog has
   already been prepared using <dialogprepare>, then the MS starts the
   dialog indicated by the prepareddialogid attribute.  Otherwise, a new
   VoiceXML dialog can be started by setting the type attribute to
   "application/voicexml+xml" and the src attribute to the URI of the
   VoiceXML document.  For example:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="ssd3r3:sds345b"
                 type="application/voicexml+xml"
                 src="http://www.example.com/mydialog.vxml"
                 fetchtimeout="15s"/>
   </mscivr>

   The maxage and maxstale attributes, if specified, control how the
   initial VoiceXML document is fetched using HTTP (see [RFC2616]).
   Note that the fetchtimeout attribute is not defined in VoiceXML for
   an initial document, but the MS MUST support this attribute in its



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 123]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   VoiceXML environment.  Note also that support for <dtmfsub>
   subscriptions (Section 4.2.2.1.1) and their associated dialog
   notification events is not defined in VoiceXML.  If such a
   subscription is specified in a <dialogstart> request, then the MS
   sends a 439 error response (see Section 4.5).

   The success or failure of starting a VoiceXML dialog is reported in
   the MS response as described in Section 4.2.2.

   When the MS starts a VoiceXML dialog, the MS MUST map session
   information into a VoiceXML session variable object.  There are 3
   types of session information: protocol information (Section 9.2.1),
   media stream information (Section 9.2.2), and parameter information
   (Section 9.2.3).

9.2.1.  Session Protocol Information

   If the connectionid attribute is specified, the MS assigns protocol
   information from the SIP dialog associated with the connection to the
   following session variables in VoiceXML:

   session.connection.local.uri  Evaluates to the SIP URI specified in
      the 'To:' header of the initial INVITE.

   session.connection.remote.uri  Evaluates to the SIP URI specified in
      the 'From:' header of the initial INVITE.

   session.connection.originator  Evaluates to the value of
      session.connection.remote (MS receives inbound connections but
      does not create outbound connections).

   session.connection.protocol.name  Evaluates to "sip".  Note that this
      is intended to reflect the use of SIP in general, and does not
      distinguish between whether the connection accesses the MS via SIP
      or SIP Secure (SIPS) procedures.

   session.connection.protocol.version  Evaluates to "2.0".

   session.connection.redirect  This array is populated by information
      contained in the 'History-Info' header [RFC4244] in the initial
      INVITE or is otherwise undefined.  Each entry (hi-entry) in the
      'History-Info' header is mapped, in the order it appeared in the
      'History-Info' header, into an element of the
      session.connection.redirect array.  Properties of each element of
      the array are determined as follows:

      uri    Set to the hi-targeted-to-uri value of the History-Info
             entry



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 124]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


      pi     Set to 'true' if hi-targeted-to-uri contains a
             'Privacy=history' parameter, or if the INVITE 'Privacy'
             header includes 'history'; 'false' otherwise

      si     Set to the value of the 'si' parameter if it exists;
             undefined otherwise

      reason Set verbatim to the value of the 'Reason' parameter of hi-
             targeted-to-uri

   session.connection.aai  Evaluates to the value of a SIP header with
      the name "aai" if present; undefined otherwise.

   session.connection.protocol.sip.requesturi  This is an associative
      array where the array keys and values are formed from the URI
      parameters on the SIP Request-URI of the initial INVITE.  The
      array key is the URI parameter name.  The corresponding array
      value is obtained by evaluating the URI parameter value as a
      string.  In addition, the array's toString() function returns the
      full SIP Request-URI.

   session.connection.protocol.sip.headers  This is an associative array
      where each key in the array is the non-compact name of a SIP
      header in the initial INVITE converted to lowercase (note the case
      conversion does not apply to the header value).  If multiple
      header fields of the same field name are present, the values are
      combined into a single comma-separated value.  Implementations
      MUST at a minimum include the 'Call-ID' header and MAY include
      other headers.  For example,
      session.connection.protocol.sip.headers["call-id"] evaluates to
      the Call-ID of the SIP dialog.

   If a conferenceid attribute is specified, then the MS populates the
   following session variables in VoiceXML:

   session.conference.name  Evaluates to the value of the conferenceid
      attribute.

9.2.2.  Session Media Stream Information

   The media streams of the connection or conference to use for the
   dialog are described in Section 4.2.2, including use of <stream>
   elements (Section 4.2.2.2) if specified.  The MS maps media stream
   information into the VoiceXML session variable
   session.connection.protocol.sip.media for a connection, and
   session.conference.media for a conference.  In both variables, the
   value of the variable is an array where each array element is an
   object with the following properties:



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 125]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   type  This required property indicates the type of the media
      associated with the stream (see Section 4.2.2.2 <stream> type
      attribute definition).

   direction  This required property indicates the directionality of the
      media relative to the endpoint of the dialog (see Section 4.2.2.2
      <stream> direction attribute definition).

   format  This property is optional.  If defined, the value of the
      property is an array.  Each array element is an object that
      specifies information about one format of the media stream.  The
      object contains at least one property called name whose value is
      the subtype name of the media format [RFC4855].  Other properties
      may be defined with string values; these correspond to required
      and, if defined, optional parameters of the format.

   As a consequence of this definition, when a connectionid is specified
   there is an array entry in session.connection.protocol.sip.media for
   each media stream used by the VoiceXML dialog.  For an example,
   consider a connection with bidirectional G.711 mu-law audio sampled
   at 8kHz where the dialog is started with

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="ssd3r3:sds345b"
                 type="application/voicexml+xml"
                 src="http://www.example.com/mydialog.vxml"
                 fetchtimeout="15s">
     <stream media="audio" direction="recvonly"/>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   In this case, session.connection.protocol.sip.media[0].type evaluates
   to "audio", session.connection.protocol.sip.media[0].direction
   evaluates to "recvonly" (i.e., the endpoint only receives media from
   the dialog -- the endpoint does not send media to the dialog),
   session.connection.protocol.sip.media[0].format[0].name evaluates to
   "PCMU", and session.connection.protocol.sip.media[0].format[0].rate
   evaluates to "8000".

   Note that the session variable is updated if the connection or
   conference media session characteristics for the VoiceXML dialog
   change (e.g., due to a SIP re-INVITE).

9.2.3.  Session Parameter Information

   Parameter information is specified in the <params> child element of
   <dialogprepare> and <dialogstart> elements, where each parameter is
   specified using a <param> element.  The MS maps parameter information
   into VoiceXML session variables as follows:

   session.values  This is an associative array mapped to the <params>
      element.  It is undefined if no <params> element is specified.  If
      a <params> element is specified in both <dialogprepare> and
      <dialogstart> elements for the same dialog, then the array is
      first initialized with the <params> specified in the
      <dialogprepare> element and then updated with the <params>
      specified in the <dialogstart> element; in cases of conflict, the
      <dialogstart> parameter value take priority.  Array keys and
      values are formed from <param> children of the <params> element.
      Each array key is the value of the name attribute of a <param>
      element.  If the same name is used in more than one <param>
      element, then the array key is associated with the last <param> in
      document order.  The corresponding value for each key is an object
      with two required properties: a "type" property evaluating to the
      value of the type attribute, and a "content" property evaluating
      to the content of the <param>.  In addition, this object's
      toString() function returns the value of the "content" property as
      a string.

   For example, a VoiceXML dialog started with one parameter:

   <mscivr version="1.0" xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:msc-ivr">
    <dialogstart connectionid="ssd3r3:sds345b"
                 type="application/voicexml+xml"
                 src="http://www.example.com/mydialog.vxml"
                 fetchtimeout="15s">
     <params>
      <param name="mode">playannouncement</param>
     </params>
    </dialogstart>
   </mscivr>

   In this case, session.values would be defined with one item in the
   array where session.values['mode'].type evaluates to "text/plain"
   (the default value), session.values['mode'].content evaluates to
   "playannouncement", and session.values['mode'].toString() also
   evaluates to "playannouncement".

   The MS sends an error response (see Section 4.2.2) if a <param> is
   not supported by the MS (e.g., the parameter type is not supported).

9.3.  Terminating a VoiceXML Dialog

   When the MS receives a request with a <dialogterminate> element
   (Section 4.2.3), the MS throws a 'connection.disconnect.hangup' event
   into the specified VoiceXML dialog.  Note that if the immediate
   attribute has the value true, then the MS MUST NOT return <params>
   information when the VoiceXML dialog exits (even if the VoiceXML
   dialog provides such information) -- see Section 9.4.

   If the connection or conference associated with the VoiceXML dialog
   terminates, then the MS throws a 'connection.disconnect.hangup' event
   into the specified VoiceXML dialog.

9.4.  Exiting a VoiceXML Dialog

   The MS sends a <dialogexit> notification event (Section 4.2.5.1) when
   the VoiceXML dialog is complete, has been terminated, or exits due to
   an error.  The <dialogexit> status attribute specifies the status of
   the VoiceXML dialog when it exits and its <params> child element
   specifies information, if any, returned from the VoiceXML dialog.

   A VoiceXML dialog exits when it processes a <disconnect> element, an
   <exit> element, or an implicit exit according to the VoiceXML form
   interpretation algorithm (FIA).  If the VoiceXML dialog executes a
   <disconnect> and then subsequently executes an <exit> with namelist
   information, the namelist information from the <exit> element is
   discarded.

   The MS reports namelist variables in the <params> element of the
   <dialogexit>.  Each <param> reports on a namelist variable.  The MS
   set the <param> name attribute to the name of the VoiceXML variable.
   The MS sets the <param> type attribute according to the type of the
   VoiceXML variable.  The MS sets the <param> type to 'text/plain' when
   the VoiceXML variable is a simple ECMAScript value.  If the VoiceXML
   variable is a recording, the MS sets the <param> type to the MIME
   media type of the recording and encodes the recorded content as CDATA
   in the <param> (see Section 4.2.6.1 for an example).  If the VoiceXML
   variable is a complex ECMAScript value (e.g., object, array, etc.),
   the MS sets the <param> type to 'application/json' and converts the
   variable value to its JSON value equivalent [RFC4627].  The behavior
   resulting from specifying an ECMAScript object with circular
   references is not defined.

   If the expr attribute is specified on the VoiceXML <exit> element
   instead of the namelist attribute, the MS creates a <param> element
   with the reserved name '__exit'.  If the value is an ECMAScript
   literal, the <param> type is 'text/plain' and the content is the
   literal value.  If the value is a variable, the <param> type and



McGlashan, et al.            Standards Track                  [Page 128]

RFC 6231                   IVR Control Package                  May 2011


   content are set in the same way as a namelist variable; for example,
   an expr attribute referencing a variable with a simple ECMAScript
   value has the type 'text/plain' and the content is set to the
   ECMAScript value.  To allow the AS to differentiate between a
   <dialogexit> notification event resulting from a VoiceXML
   <disconnect> from one resulting from an <exit>, the MS creates a
   <param> with the reserved name '__reason', the type 'text/plain', and
   a value of "disconnect" (without brackets) to reflect the use of
   VoiceXML's <disconnect> element, and the value of "exit" (without
   brackets) to an explicit <exit> in the VoiceXML dialog.  If the
   VoiceXML session terminates for other reasons (such as encountering
   an error), this parameter MAY be omitted or take on platform-specific
   values prefixed with an underscore.

   Table 2 provides some examples of VoiceXML <exit> usage and the
   corresponding <params> element in the <dialogexit> notification
   event.  It assumes the following VoiceXML variable names and values:
   userAuthorized=true, pin=1234, and errors=0.  The <param> type
   attributes ('text/plain') are omitted for clarity.

9.5.  Call Transfer

   While VoiceXML is at its core a dialog language, it also provides
   optional call transfer capability.  It is NOT RECOMMENDED to use
   VoiceXML's call transfer capability in networks involving application
   servers.  Rather, the AS itself can provide call routing

   functionality by taking signaling actions based on the data returned
   to it, either through VoiceXML's own data submission mechanisms or
   through the mechanism described in Section 9.4.  If the MS encounters
   a VoiceXML dialog requesting call transfer capability, the MS SHOULD
   raise an error event in the VoiceXML dialog execution context: an
   error.unsupported.transfer.blind event if blind transfer is
   requested, error.unsupported.transfer.bridge if bridge transfer is
   requested, or error.unsupported.transfer.consultation if consultation
   transfer is requested.
