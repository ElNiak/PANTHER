Abstract

   This document describes an RTP [1] payload format for transporting
   the coordinates of a dynamic pointer that may be used during a
   presentation. Although a mouse can be used as the pointer, this
   payload format is not intended and may not have all functionalities
   needed to implement a general mouse event transmission mechanism.

1. Introduction

   In most presentations, significant information is conveyed through
   the use of viewgraphs and a pointer. This makes accurate transmission
   of them vital in remote conferencing applications. Using regular
   video of a presenter's display for this purpose is problematic
   because, while the viewgraphs require a high spatial resolution, the
   pointer movements need to be sampled and transmitted at a high
   temporal resolution so that the presenter's pointing actions can be
   displayed synchronously with the corresponding audio and video
   signals. In many instances, this synchronization carries vital
   information.  As an example, consider a speaker pointing at two
   alternatives on a viewgraph in sequence and saying "this one is
   better than this".  To satisfy both high spatial and high temporal
   resolution requirements, at least S-VHS quality video may need to be
   used. Codecs that can compress S-VHS video effectively in real-time
   are expensive for this purpose, and transmitting such video
   uncompressed requires very high bandwidths.

RFC 2862       RTP Payload Format for Real-Time Pointers       June 2000


   A much simpler and economical system can be designed by capturing and
   transmitting the pointer coordinates separately [2]. The pointer
   coordinates with respect to a displayed viewgraph can easily be
   obtained in electronic presentation systems. For presentations
   prepared for optical systems, such as transparencies for overhead
   projectors, an arrangement where the viewgraph is captured in a frame
   buffer on a computer can be used to associate the pointer coordinates
   with the displayed viewgraph. For capturing transparencies, printed
   material, or even three dimensional objects, a document camera and a
   personal computer or workstation based video capture card can be
   used.  This arrangement can handle electronic viewgraphs by feeding
   the video output of the computer that displays them to the video
   capture card through an appropriate converter also. A side benefit of
   this is that it allows using a presenter's own computer to transmit
   electronic viewgraphs without connecting it to, for example, an
   intranet. The captured image is then displayed along with the
   capturing computer's mouse pointer on the presenter's display using a
   projector. The presenter moves the pointer on the display using a
   regular or maybe a wireless mouse whose location can easily be
   captured by appropriate software running on the capturing computer.

   This document describes an RTP payload format to transmit the pointer
   coordinates captured in one of the ways described above using RTP.
   Although, a mouse can be used as the pointer, this payload format is
   not intended and may not have all functionalities needed to implement
   a  general mouse event transmission mechanism.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

               Figure 1 - An RTP packet for Real-Time Pointer

   Fig. 1 shows an RTP packet carrying real-time pointer coordinates.
   This payload format does not have a payload specific header.

2.1. RTP Header Usage:

   Payload Type (PT): The assignment of an RTP payload type for this new
   packet format is outside the scope of this document, and will not be
   specified here. It is expected that the RTP profile for a particular
   class of applications will assign a payload type for this encoding,
   or if that is not done then a payload type in the dynamic range shall
   be chosen.

   Marker (M) bit: Set to one if the pointer icon is changed in this
   packet.

   Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used.

   Sequence Number: Set as described in RFC1889 [1].

   Timestamp: The sampling time for the pointer location measured by a
   90kHz clock.

   SSRC: Set as described in RFC1889 [1].

   CC and CSRC fields are used as described in RFC 1889 [1].

   RTCP SHOULD be used as defined in RFC 1889 [1].

2.2. Payload:

   The pointer's x and y coordinates are measured from the upper left
   corner of the associated display window. They are represented as a
   fraction of the corresponding edge length of the display window using
   12 bits, positive, fixed point numbers between 0 and (1 - 2^-12).

   L (left), R (right) and/or M (middle) bits are pointer special
   effects flags. Their use is application dependent and MUST be
   established out-of-band. Applications MAY ignore these bits.

   PIN: Pointer Icon Number (3 bits) selects a pointer icon.  The
   association between the PIN numbers and the icon pictures MUST be
   established out-of-band. PIN = 0 represents a default pointer icon.
   Applications which only support a single pointer icon SHOULD set the
   PIN field to zero. Applications MAY ignore non-zero PIN values on
   reception, and display a default icon.

4. Security Considerations

   RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
   are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
   specification [1].

   This payload type does not exhibit any significant non-uniformity in
   the receiver side computational complexity for packet processing  to
   cause a potential denial-of-service threat.
