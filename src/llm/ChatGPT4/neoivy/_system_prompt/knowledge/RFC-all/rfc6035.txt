 Session Initiation Protocol Event Package for Voice Quality Reporting

Abstract

   This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event
   package that enables the collection and reporting of metrics that
   measure the quality for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.
   Voice call quality information derived from RTP Control Protocol
   Extended Reports (RTCP-XR) and call information from SIP is conveyed
   from a User Agent (UA) in a session, known as a reporter, to a third
   party, known as a collector.  A registration for the application/ vq-
   rtcpxr media type is also included.

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


1.  Introduction

   Real-time communications over IP networks use SIP for signaling with
   RTP/RTCP for media transport and reporting, respectively.  These
   protocols are very flexible and can support an extremely wide
   spectrum of usage scenarios.  For this reason, extensions to these
   protocols must be specified in the context of a specific usage
   scenario.  In this memo, extensions to SIP are proposed to support
   the reporting of RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports [4] metrics.

1.1.  Applicability Statement

   RTP is utilized in many different architectures and topologies.  RFC
   5117 [13] lists and describes the following topologies: point-to-
   point, point-to-multipoint using multicast, point-to-multipoint using
   the translator from RFC 3550, point-to-multipoint using the mixer
   model from RFC 3550, point-to-multipoint using video-switching
   Multipoint Control Units (MCUs), point-to-multipoint using RTCP-
   terminating MCU, and non-symmetric mixer/translators.  As the
   Abstract of this document points out, this specification is for
   reporting quality of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) sessions.
   As such, only the first topology, point to point, is currently
   supported by this specification.  This reflects both current VoIP
   deployments, which are predominantly point to point using unicast,
   and the state of research in the area of quality.

   How to accurately report the quality of a multipart conference or a
   session involving multiple hops through translators and mixers is
   currently an area of research in the industry.  However, this
   mechanism can easily be used for centrally mixed conference calls, in
   which each leg of the conferences is just a point-to-point call.
   This mechanism could be extended to cover additional RTP topologies
   in the future once these topics progress out of the realm of research
   and into actual Internet deployments.

1.2.  Use of the Mechanism

   RTCP reports are usually sent to other participating endpoints in a
   session.  This can make the collection of performance information by
   an administrator or management system quite complex to implement.  In
   the usage scenarios addressed in this memo, the data contained in
   RTCP XR VoIP metrics reports (RFC 3611 [4]) are forwarded to a
   central collection server systems using SIP.

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


   Applications residing in the server or elsewhere can aid in network
   management to alleviate bandwidth constraints and also to support
   customer service by identifying and acknowledging calls of poor
   quality.  However, specifying such applications is beyond the scope
   of this paper.

   There is a large portfolio of quality parameters that can be
   associated with VoIP, but only a minimal necessary number of
   parameters are included on the RTCP-XR reports:

   1.  The codec type, as resulting from the Session Description
       Protocol (SDP) offer-answer negotiation in SIP,

   2.  The burst gap loss density and max gap duration, since voice cut-
       outs are the most annoying quality impairment in VoIP,

   3.  Round-trip delay, because it is critical to conversational
       quality,

   4.  Conversational quality as a catch-all for other voice quality
       impairments, such as randomly distributed packet loss, jitter,
       annoying silent suppression effects, etc.

   In specific usage scenarios where other parameters are required,
   designers can include other parameters beyond the scope of this
   paper.

   RTCP reports are best effort only, and though they are very useful,
   they have a number of limitations as discussed in [3].  This must be
   considered when using RTCP reports in managed networks.

   This document defines a new SIP event package, vq-rtcpxr, and a new
   MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr, that enable the collection and
   reporting of metrics that measure quality for RTP [3] sessions.  The
   definitions of the metrics used in the event package are based on
   RTCP Extended Reports [4] and RTCP [3]; a mapping between the SIP
   event parameters and the parameters within the aforementioned RFCs is
   defined within this document in Section 4.6.2.

   Monitoring of voice quality is believed to be the highest priority
   for usage of this mechanism, and as such, the metrics in the event
   package are largely tailored for voice quality measurements.  The
   event package is designed to be extensible.  However, the negotiation
   of such extensions is not defined in this document.

   The event package supports reporting the voice quality metrics for
   both the inbound and outbound directions.  Voice quality metrics for
   the inbound direction can generally be computed locally by the

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


   reporting endpoint; however, voice quality metrics for the outbound
   direction are computed by the remote endpoint and sent to the
   reporting endpoint using the RTCP Extended Reports [4].

   The configuration of the usage of this event package is not covered
   in this document.  It is the recommendation of this document that the
   SIP configuration framework [15] be used.  This is discussed in
   Section 4.8.

   The event package SHOULD be used with the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY method;
   however, it MAY also be used with the PUBLISH method [8] for backward
   compatibility with some existing implementations.  Message flow
   examples for both methods are provided in this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

3.  SIP Events for VoIP Quality Reporting

   This document defines a SIP events package [5] for Voice over IP
   performance reporting.  A SIP UA can send these events to an entity
   that can make the information available to other applications.  For
   purposes of illustration, the entities involved in SIP vq-rtcpxr
   event reporting will be referred to as follows:

   o  REPORTER: an entity involved in the measurement and reporting of
      media quality, i.e., the SIP UA involved in a media session.

   o  COLLECTOR: an entity that receives SIP vq-rtcpxr events.  A
      COLLECTOR may be a proxy server or another entity that is capable
      of supporting SIP vq-rtcpxr events.

3.1.  SUBSCRIBE NOTIFY Method

   The COLLECTOR SHALL send a SUBSCRIBE to the REPORTER to explicitly
   establish the relationship.  The REPORTER SHOULD send the voice
   quality metric reports using the NOTIFY method.  The REPORTER MUST
   NOT send any vq-rtcpxr events if a COLLECTOR address has not been
   configured.  The REPORTER populates the Request-URI according to the
   rules for an in-dialog request.  The COLLECTOR MAY send a SUBSCRIBE
   to a SIP Proxy acting on behalf of the reporting SIP UAs.







Pendleton, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


3.2.  PUBLISH Method

   A SIP UA that supports this specification MAY also send the service
   quality metric reports using the PUBLISH method [8]; however, this
   approach SHOULD NOT be used, in general, on the public Internet.  The
   PUBLISH method MAY be supported for backward compatibility with
   existing implementations.

   The REPORTER MAY therefore populate the Request-URI of the PUBLISH
   method with the address of the COLLECTOR.  To ensure security of SIP
   proxies and the COLLECTOR, the REPORTER MUST be configured with the
   address of the COLLECTOR, preferably using the SIP UA configuration
   framework [15], as described in Section 5.8.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the REPORTER send an OPTIONS message to the
   COLLECTOR to ensure support of the PUBLISH message.

      If PUBLISH is not supported, then the REPORTER can only wait for a
      SUBSCRIBE request from the COLLECTOR and then deliver the
      information in NOTIFYs.  If a REPORTER sends a PUBLISH to a
      COLLECTOR that does not support or allow this method, a 501 Not
      Implemented or a 405 Method Not Allowed response will be received,
      and the REPORTER will stop publication.

3.3.  Multi-Party and Multi-Segment Calls

   A voice quality metric report may be sent for each session
   terminating at the REPORTER, and it may contain multiple report
   bodies.  For a multi-party call, the report MAY contain report bodies
   for the session between the reporting endpoint and each remote
   endpoint for which there was an RTP session during the call.

   Multi-party services such as call hold and call transfer can result
   in the user participating in a series of concatenated sessions,
   potentially with different choices of codec or sample rate, although
   these may be perceived by the user as a single call.  A REPORTER MAY
   send a voice quality metric report at the end of each session or MAY
   send a single voice quality metric report containing an application/
   vq-rtcpxr body for each segment of the call.

3.4.  Overload Avoidance

   Users of this extension should ensure that they implement general SIP
   mechanisms for avoiding overload.  For instance, an overloaded proxy
   or COLLECTOR MUST send a 503 Service Unavailable or other 5xx
   response with an appropriate Retry-After time specified.  REPORTERs
   MUST act on these responses and respect the Retry-After time




Pendleton, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


   interval.  In addition, future SIP extensions to better handle
   overload as covered in [14] should be followed as they are
   standardized.

   To avoid overload of SIP Proxies or COLLECTORS, it is important to do
   capacity planning and to minimize the number of reports that are
   sent.

   Approaches to avoiding overload include:

   a.  Send only one report at the end of each call.

   b.  Use interval reports only on "problem" calls that are being
       closely monitored.

   c.  Limit the number of alerts that can be sent to a maximum of one
       per call.

4.  Event Package Formal Definition

4.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package.  SIP Event Packages were
   originally defined in RFC 3265 [5].

4.2.  Event Package Parameters

   No event package parameters are defined.

4.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   SUBSCRIBE bodies are described by this specification.

4.4.  Subscribe Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

4.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   There are three notify bodies: a Session report, an Interval report,
   and an Alert report.

   The Session report SHOULD be used for reporting when a voice media
   session terminates, when a media change occurs, such as a codec
   change or a session fork, or when a session terminates due to no
   media packets being received and MUST NOT be used for reporting at

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


   arbitrary points in time.  This report MUST be used for cumulative
   metric reporting and the report timestamps MUST be from the start of
   a media session to the time at which the report is generated.

   The Interval report SHOULD be used for periodic or interval reporting
   and MUST NOT be used for reporting of the complete media session.
   This report is intended to capture short duration metric reporting
   and the report intervals SHOULD be non-overlapping time windows.

   The Alert report MAY be used when voice quality degrades during a
   session.  The time window to which an Alert report relates MAY be a
   short time interval or from the start of the call to the point the
   alert is generated; this time window SHOULD be selected to provide
   the most useful information to support problem diagnosis.

   Session, Interval, and Alert reports MUST populate the metrics with
   values that are measured over the interval explicitly defined by the
   "start" and "stop" timestamps.

   Voice quality summary reports reference only one codec (payload
   type).  This payload type SHOULD be the main voice payload, not
   comfort noise or telephone event payloads.  For applications that
   consistently and rapidly switch codecs, the most used codec should be
   reported.  All values in the report, such as IP addresses,
   synchronization source (SSRC), etc., represent those values as
   received by the REPORTER.  In some scenarios, these may not be the
   same on either end of the session -- the COLLECTOR will need logic to
   be able to put these sessions together.  The values of parameters
   such as sample rate, frame duration, frame octets, packets per
   second, round-trip delay, etc., depend on the type of report in which
   they are present.  If present in a Session or an Interval report,
   they represent average values over the session or interval.  If
   present in an Alert report, they represent instantaneous values.

   The REPORTER always includes local quality reporting information and
   should, if possible, share remote quality reporting information to
   the COLLECTOR.  This remote quality could be available from received
   RTCP-XR reports or other sources.  Reporting this is useful in cases
   where the other end might support RTCP-XR but not this voice quality
   reporting.

   This specification defines a new MIME type, application/vq-rtcpxr,
   which is a text encoding of the RTCP and RTCP-XR statistics with some
   additional metrics and correlation information.

4.6.  Voice Quality Event and Semantics

   This section describes the syntax extensions required for event
   publication in SIP.  The formal syntax definitions described in this
   section are expressed in the Augmented BNF [6] format used in SIP [2]
   and contain references to elements defined therein.

   Additionally, the definition of the timestamp format is provided in
   [7].  Note that most of the parameters are optional.  In practice,
   most implementations will send a subset of the parameters.  It is not
   the intention of this document to define what parameters may or may
   not be useful for monitoring the quality of a voice session, but to
   enable reporting of voice quality.  As such, the syntax allows the
   implementer to choose which metrics are most appropriate for their
   solution.  As there are no "invalid", "unknown", or "not applicable"
   values in the syntax, the intention is to exclude any parameters for
   which values are not available, not applicable, or unknown.

   The authors recognize that implementers may need to add new parameter
   lines to the reports and new metrics to the existing parameter lines.
   The extension tokens are intended to fulfill this need.

4.6.2.  Parameter Definitions and Mappings

   Parameter values, codec types, and other aspects of the endpoints may
   change dynamically during a session.  The reported values of metrics
   and configuration parameters SHALL be the current value at the time
   the report is generated.

   The Packet Loss Rate and Packet Discard Rate parameters are
   calculated over the period between the starting and ending timestamps
   for the report.  These are normally calculated from a count of the
   number of lost or discarded packets divided by the count of the
   number of packets, and hence are based on the current values of these
   counters at the time the report was generated.

   Packet delay variation, signal level, noise level, and echo level are
   computed as running or interval averages, based on the appropriate
   standard, e.g., RFC 3550 for Packet Delay Variation (PDV), and the
   sampled value of these running averages is reported.  Delay, packet
   size, jitter buffer size, and codec-related data may change during a
   session and the current value of these parameters is reported as
   sampled at the time the report is generated.

4.6.2.1.  General Mapping Percentages from 8-bit, Fixed-Point Numbers

   RFC 3611 uses an 8-bit, fixed-point number with the binary point at
   the left edge of the field.  This value is calculated by dividing the
   total number of packets lost by the total number of packets expected
   and multiplying the result by 256, and then taking the integer part.

   For any RTCP XR parameter in this format, to map into the equivalent
   SIP vq-rtcpxr parameter, simply reverse the equation, i.e., divide by
   256 and take the integer part.

4.6.2.2.  Timestamps

   Following SIP and other IETF conventions, timestamps are provided in
   Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) using the ABNF format provided in
   RFC 3339 [7].  These timestamps SHOULD reflect, as closely as
   possible, the actual time during which the media session was running
   to enable correlation to related events occurring in the network and
   to accounting or billing records.

4.6.2.3.  SessionDescription

   The parameters in this field provide a shortened version of the
   session SDP(s), containing only the relevant parameters for session
   quality reporting purposes.  Where values may change during a
   session, for example, a codec may change rate, then the most-recent
   value of the parameter is reported.

4.6.2.3.1.  Payload Type

   This is the "payload type" parameter used in the RTP packets, i.e.,
   the codec.  This field can also be mapped from the SDP "rtpmap"
   attribute field "payload type".  IANA-registered types SHOULD be
   used.

4.6.2.3.2.  Payload Desc

   This parameter is a text description of the codec.  This parameter
   SHOULD use the IANA registry for media-type names where it
   unambiguously defines the codec.  Refer to the "Audio Media Types"
   registry on http://www.iana.org.

4.6.2.3.3.  Sample Rate

   This parameter is mapped from the SDP "rtpmap" attribute field "clock
   rate".  The field provides the rate at which a voice was sampled,
   measured in Hertz (Hz).

4.6.2.3.4.  Packets Per Second

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be
   obtained from the device codec.  Packets per second provides the
   (rounded) number of RTP packets that are transmitted per second.

4.6.2.3.5.  Frame Duration

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be
   obtained from the device codec.  The field reflects the amount of
   voice content in each frame within the RTP payload, measured in
   milliseconds.  Note that this value can be combined with the
   FramesPerPacket to determine the packetization rate.  Also, where a
   sample-based codec is used, a "frame" refers to the set of samples
   carried in an RTP packet.

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


4.6.2.3.6.  Frame Octets

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but is usually provided
   by the device codec.  The field provides the number of octets in each
   frame within the RTP payload.  This field is usually not provided
   when the FrameDuration is provided.  Also, where a sample-based codec
   is used, a "frame" refers to the set of samples carried in an RTP
   packet.

4.6.2.3.7.  Frames Per Packet

   This parameter is not contained in RTP or SDP but can usually be
   obtained from the device codec.  This field provides the number of
   frames in each RTP packet.  Note that this value can be combined with
   the FrameDuration to determine the packetization rate.  Also, where a
   sample-based codec is used, a "frame" refers to the set of samples
   carried in an RTP packet.

4.6.2.3.8.  FMTP Options

   This parameter is taken directly from the SDP attribute "fmtp"
   defined in RFC 4566.

4.6.2.3.9.  Silence Suppression State

   This parameter does not correspond to SDP, RTP, or RTCP XR.  It
   indicates whether silence suppression, also known as Voice Activity
   Detection (VAD), is enabled for the identified session.

4.6.2.3.10.  Packet Loss Concealment

   This value corresponds to "PLC" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  The values defined by RFC 3611 are reused by this
   recommendation and therefore no mapping is required.

4.6.2.4.  LocalAddr

   This field provides the IP address, port, and synchronization source
   (SSRC) for the session from the perspective of the endpoint that is
   measuring performance.  The IPAddress MAY be in IPv4 or IPv6 format.
   The SSRC is taken from SDP, RTCP, or RTCP XR input parameters.

   In the presence of NAT and where a NAT-traversal mechanism such as
   Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [16] is used, the external
   IP address can be reported, since the internal IP address is not
   visible to the network operator.

4.6.2.5.  RemoteAddr

   This field provides the IP address, port, and SSRC of the session
   peer from the perspective of the remote endpoint measuring
   performance.  In the presence of NAT and where a NAT-traversal
   mechanism such as STUN [16] is used, the external IP address can be
   reported, since the internal IP address is not visible to the network
   operator.

4.6.2.6.  Jitter Buffer Parameters

4.6.2.6.1.  Jitter Buffer Adaptive

   This value corresponds to "JBA" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  The values defined by RFC 3611 are unchanged and
   therefore no mapping is required.

4.6.2.6.2.  Jitter Buffer Rate

   This value corresponds to "JB rate" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  The parameter does not require any conversion.

4.6.2.6.3.  Jitter Buffer Nominal

   This value corresponds to "JB nominal" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  The parameter does not require any conversion.

4.6.2.6.4.  Jitter Buffer Max

   This value corresponds to "JB maximum" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  The parameter does not require any conversion.

4.6.2.6.5.  Jitter Buffer Abs Max

   This value corresponds to "JB abs max" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  The parameter does not require any conversion.

4.6.2.7.  Packet Loss Parameters

4.6.2.7.1.  Network Loss Rate

   This value corresponds to "loss rate" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  For conversion, see Section 4.6.2.1.  A loss rate of
   100% MAY be reported if media packets were expected but none had been
   received at the time of session termination.

   This value corresponds to "burst density" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  For conversion, see Section 4.6.2.1.

4.6.2.8.2.  Burst Duration

   This value corresponds to "burst duration" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  This value requires no conversion; the exact
   value sent in an RTCP XR VoIP Metrics Report Block can be included in
   the SIP vq-rtcpxr parameter.

4.6.2.8.3.  Gap Loss Density

   This value corresponds to "gap density" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   metrics Report Block.

4.6.2.8.4.  Gap Duration

   This value corresponds to "gap duration" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  This value requires no conversion; the exact
   value sent in an RTCP XR VoIP Metrics Report Block can be reported.

4.6.2.8.5.  Minimum Gap Threshold

   This value corresponds to "Gmin" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This value requires no conversion; the exact value
   sent in an RTCP XR VoIP Metrics Report Block can be reported.

4.6.2.9.  Delay Parameters

4.6.2.9.1.  Round-Trip Delay

   This value corresponds to "round trip delay" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block and may be measured using the method defined in
   RFC 3550.  The parameter is expressed in milliseconds.

4.6.2.9.2.  End System Delay

   This value corresponds to "end system delay" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  This parameter does not require any
   conversion.  The parameter is expressed in milliseconds.

   This value is computed by adding Round-Trip Delay to the local and
   remote End System Delay and dividing by two.

4.6.2.9.4.  One-Way Delay

   This value SHOULD be measured using the methods defined in IETF RFC
   2679 [12].  The parameter is expressed in milliseconds.

4.6.2.9.5.  Inter-Arrival Jitter

   Inter-arrival jitter is calculated as defined in RFC 3550 and
   converted into milliseconds.

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


4.6.2.10.3.  Residual Echo Return Loss (RERL)

   This field corresponds to "RERL" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This field provides the ratio between the original
   signal and the echo level in decibels, as measured after echo
   cancellation or suppression has been applied.  This value can be used
   directly without extra conversion.

4.6.2.11.  Quality Scores

4.6.2.11.1.  ListeningQualityR

   This field reports the listening quality expressed as an R factor
   (per G.107).  This does not include the effects of echo or delay.
   The range of R is 0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband
   calls.  Algorithms for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with
   ITU-T Recommendations P.564 [10] and G.107 [11].

4.6.2.11.2.  RLQEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ListeningQualityR.  This field will be free form text and not
   necessarily reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.3.  ConversationalQualityR

   This field corresponds to "R factor" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This parameter provides a cumulative measurement of
   voice quality from the start of the session to the reporting time.
   The range of R is 0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband
   calls.  Algorithms for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with
   ITU-T Recommendations P.564 and G.107.  Within RFC 3611, a reported R
   factor of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable; in this
   case, the ConversationalQualityR parameter MUST be omitted from the
   vq-rtcpxr event.

4.6.2.11.4.  RCQEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ConversationalQualityR.  This field will be free form text and not
   necessarily reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.5.  ExternalR-In

   This field corresponds to "ext. R factor" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  This parameter reflects voice quality as
   measured by the local endpoint for incoming connection on "other"
   side (refer to RFC 3611 for a more-detailed explanation).  The range

RFC 6035         SIP Package for Voice Quality Reporting   November 2010


   of R is 0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband calls.
   Algorithms for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T
   Recommendations P.564 and G.107.  Within RFC 3611, a reported R
   factor of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable; in this
   case, the ConversationalQualityR parameter MUST be omitted from the
   vq-rtcpxr event.

4.6.2.11.6.  ExtRInEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ExternalR-In.  This field will be free-form text and not necessarily
   reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.7.  ExternalR-Out

   This field corresponds to "ext. R factor" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP
   Metrics Report Block.  Here, the value is copied from RTCP XR message
   received from the remote endpoint on the "other" side of this
   endpoint; refer to RFC 3611 for a more detailed explanation).  The
   range of R is 0-95 for narrowband calls and 0-120 for wideband calls.
   Algorithms for computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T
   Recommendations P.564 and G.107.  Within RFC 3611, a reported R
   factor of 127 indicates that this parameter is unavailable; in this
   case, the ConversationalQualityR parameter SHALL be omitted from the
   vq-rtcpxr event.

4.6.2.11.8.  ExtROutEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   ExternalR-Out.  This field will be free-form text and not necessarily
   reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.9.  MOS Reporting

   Conversion of RFC 3611 reported mean opinion scores (MOSs) for use in
   reporting MOS-LQ and MOS-CQ MUST be performed by dividing the RFC
   3611 reported value by 10 if this value is less than or equal to 50
   or omitting the MOS-xQ parameter if the RFC 3611 reported value is
   127 (which indicates unavailable).

4.6.2.11.9.1.  MOS-LQ

   This field corresponds to "MOSLQ" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This parameter is the estimated mean opinion score for
   listening voice quality on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5 represents
   "Excellent" and 1 represents "Unacceptable".  Algorithms for

   computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T Recommendation
   P.564 [10].  This field provides a text name for the algorithm used
   to estimate MOS-LQ.

4.6.2.11.9.2.  MOS-CQ

   This field corresponds to "MOSCQ" in RFC 3611 in the VoIP Metrics
   Report Block.  This parameter is the estimated mean opinion score for
   conversation voice quality on a scale from 1 to 5, in which 5
   represents excellent and 1 represents unacceptable.  Algorithms for
   computing this value SHOULD be compliant with ITU-T Recommendation
   P.564 with regard to the listening quality element of the computed
   MOS score.

4.6.2.11.9.3.  MOSCQEstAlg

   This field provides a text name for the algorithm used to estimate
   MOS-CQ.  This field will be free-form text and not necessarily
   reflective of any standards or recommendations.

4.6.2.11.10.  QoEEstAlg

   This field provides a text description of the algorithm used to
   estimate all voice quality metrics.  This parameter is provided as an
   alternative to the separate estimation algorithms for use when the
   same algorithm is used for all measurements.  This field will be
   free-form text and not necessarily reflective of any standards or
   recommendations.

4.8.  Configuration Dataset for vq-rtcpxr Events

   It is the suggestion of the authors that the SIP configuration
   framework [15] be used to establish the necessary parameters for
   usage of vq-rtcpxr events.  A dataset for this purpose should be
   designed and documented in a separate document upon completion of the
   framework.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new SIP Event Package and a new media type.

6.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information since they can provide
   information about the nature and duration of a session established
   between two or more endpoints.  As a result, any third party wishing
   to obtain this information SHOULD be properly authenticated by the
   SIP UA using standard SIP mechanisms and according to the
   recommendations in [5].  Additionally, the event content MAY be
   encrypted to ensure confidentiality; the mechanisms for providing
   confidentiality are detailed in [2].

7.  Contributors

   The authors would like to thank Rajesh Kumar, Dave Oran, Tom Redman,
   Shane Holthaus, and Jack Ford for their comments and input.
