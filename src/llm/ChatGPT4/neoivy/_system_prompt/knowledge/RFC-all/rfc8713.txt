1.  Introduction

   This document is a revision of [RFC7437] that updates it to be
   consistent with the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) 2.0
   changes.  RFC 7437 was based on [RFC3777] that consolidated and
   updated other RFCs that updated that document into a single
   specification.  The result is a complete specification of the process
   by which members of the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) and
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), some Trustees of the IETF
   Trust, and some Directors of the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC),
   are selected, confirmed, and recalled.

   This revision addresses only the changes required for IASA 2.0;
   should the community agree on other changes, they will be addressed
   in future documents.

   Section 2 of [RFC8714] provides further details about the IETF Trust
   Trustees positions that are filled by the IETF Nominating Committee
   (NomCom).

   Section 5 of [RFC8711] provides further details about the IETF LLC
   Director positions that are filled by the NomCom.

   The following two assumptions continue to be true of this
   specification:

   1.  The Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) and Internet Research
       Steering Group (IRSG) are not a part of the process described
       here.

   2.  The organization (and reorganization) of the IESG is not a part
       of the process described here.

   The time frames specified here use IETF meetings as a frame of
   reference.  The time frames assume that the IETF meets three times
   per calendar year with approximately equal amounts of time between
   them.  The meetings are referred to as the First IETF, Second IETF,
   or Third IETF as needed.

   The next section lists the words and phrases commonly used throughout
   this document with their intended meaning.

   The majority of this document is divided into four major topics as
   follows:

   General:  This is a set of rules and constraints that apply to the
      selection and confirmation process as a whole.

   Nominating Committee Selection:  This is the process by which the
      volunteers who will serve on the NomCom are selected.

   Nominating Committee Operation:  This is the set of principles,
      rules, and constraints that guide the activities of the NomCom,
      including the confirmation process.

   Member, Trustee, and Director Recall:  This is the process by which
      the behavior of a sitting member of the IESG, or IAB, or IETF
      Trust Trustee, or IETF LLC Director may be questioned, perhaps
      resulting in the removal of the sitting member.  See Section 2 for
      a description of what a sitting member means for each of these
      groups.

   A final section describes how this document differs from [RFC3777]
   and [RFC7437].

   An appendix of useful facts and practices collected from previous
   NomComs is also included.

   This document updates the IAB, IESG, and IAOC Selection,
   Confirmation, and Recall Process to be aligned with IASA 2.0 Model
   [RFC8711] that creates an IETF Administration Limited Liability
   Company (IETF LLC) managed by a Board of Directors (IETF LLC Board).
   This document obsoletes [RFC7437] and [RFC8318].

2.  Definitions

   The following words and phrases are commonly used throughout this
   document.  They are listed here with their intended meaning for the
   convenience of the reader.

   Candidate:  A nominee who has been selected to be considered for
      confirmation by a confirming body.

   Confirmed Candidate:  A candidate that has been reviewed and approved
      by a confirming body.

   Nominating Committee Term:  The term begins when its members are
      officially announced, which is expected to be prior to the Third
      IETF to ensure it is fully operational at the Third IETF.  The
      term ends at the Third IETF (not three meetings) after the next
      NomCom's term begins.

   IETF Executive Director:  The person charged with day-to-day
      operation of the IETF's administrative functions.  (See
      Section 4.1 of [RFC8711]).  Note: This was previously the name of
      the IETF Secretariat position that is now called the "Managing
      Director, IETF Secretariat".

   Managing Director, IETF Secretariat:  The person charged with
      operation of the IETF Secretariat function.  (See Section 2 of
      [RFC3710] and [RFC8717]).

   Nominee:  A person who is being or has been considered for one or
      more open positions of the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust Trustee, or IETF
      LLC.

   Sitting Member:  A person who is currently serving as a member of the
      IESG or IAB.

   Sitting Director:  A person who is currently serving as a Director of
      the IETF LLC.

   Sitting IETF Trust Trustee:  A person who is currently serving as a
      Trustee of the IETF Trust.

3.  General

   The following set of rules apply to the process as a whole.  If
   necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is
   included.

3.1.  Completion Due

   The completion of the annual process is due within seven months.

   The completion of the annual process is due one month prior to the
   Friday of the week before the First IETF.  It is expected to begin at
   least eight months prior to the Friday of the week before the First
   IETF.

   The process officially begins with the announcement of the Chair of
   the committee.  The process officially ends when all confirmed
   candidates have been announced.

   The annual process is comprised of three major components as follows:

   1.  The selection and organization of the NomCom members.

   2.  The selection of candidates by the NomCom.

   3.  The confirmation of the candidates.

   There is an additional month set aside between when the annual
   process is expected to end and the term of the new candidates is to
   begin.  This time may be used during unusual circumstances to extend
   the time allocated for any of the components listed above.

3.2.  Nominating Committee Principal Functions

   The principal functions of the NomCom are to review each open IESG,
   IAB, IETF Trust, and IETF LLC Director position and to select either
   its incumbent or a superior candidate.

   Although there is no term limit for serving in any IESG, IAB, or IETF
   Trust position, the NomCom may use length of service as one of its
   criteria for evaluating an incumbent.

   The NomCom does not select the open positions to be reviewed; it is
   instructed as to which positions to review.

   The NomCom will be given the titles of the positions to be reviewed
   and a brief summary of the desired expertise of the candidate that is
   selected to fill each position.

   Incumbents must notify the NomCom if they wish to be nominated.

   The NomCom does not confirm its candidates; it presents its
   candidates to the appropriate confirming body as indicated below.

   A superior candidate is one who the NomCom believes would contribute
   in such a way as to improve or enhance the body to which he or she is
   nominated.

3.3.  Positions to Be Reviewed

   Approximately one-half of each of the then current IESG and IAB
   positions, one IETF Trust position, and one IETF LLC Director
   position, is selected to be reviewed each year.

   The intent of this rule is to ensure the review of approximately one-
   half of each of the IESG and IAB sitting members, one of the three
   NomCom-nominated IETF LLC Director positions, and one of the three
   nominated IETF Trust Trustee positions, each year.  It is recognized
   that circumstances may exist that will require the NomCom to review
   more or less than the usual number of positions, e.g., if the IESG,
   IAB, IETF Trust, or IETF LLC Board have reorganized prior to this
   process and created new positions, if there are an odd number of
   current positions, or if a member, a Director, or a Trustee
   unexpectedly resigns.

3.4.  Term Lengths

   Confirmed IESG and IAB candidates are expected to serve at least a
   two-year term.  The intent of this rule is to ensure that members of
   the IESG and IAB serve the number of years that best facilitates the
   review of one-half of the members each year.

   Confirmed IETF LLC Director candidates are expected to serve at least
   a three-year term, except if a nominating or selection body decides
   to use a shorter term to allow for initial staggered appointments.
   Please refer to Section 6 of [RFC8711] for additional guidance on
   term length and term limits for the IETF LLC Board.

   Confirmed IETF Trust Trustee candidates are expected to serve at
   least a three-year term, except if a nominating or selection body
   decides to use a shorter term to allow for initial staggered
   appointments.  Please refer to Section 2 of [RFC8714] for additional
   guidance on term length and term limits for the IETF Trust.

   The term of a confirmed candidate selected according to the mid-term
   vacancy rules may be less than a full term (two years for IESG and
   IAB, three years for the IETF Trust and IETF LLC), as stated
   elsewhere in this document.

   It is consistent with this rule for the NomCom to choose one or more
   of the currently open positions to which it may assign a term of not
   more than three years in order to ensure the ideal application of
   this rule in the future.

   It is consistent with this rule for the NomCom to choose one or more
   of the currently open positions that share responsibilities with
   other positions (both those being reviewed and those sitting) to
   which it may assign a term of not more than three years to ensure
   that all such members, Directors, or Trustees will not be reviewed at
   the same time.

   All sitting member terms end during the First IETF meeting
   corresponding to the end of the term for which they were confirmed.
   All confirmed candidate terms begin during the First IETF meeting
   corresponding to the beginning of the term for which they were
   confirmed.

   For confirmed candidates of the IESG, the terms begin no later than
   when the currently sitting members' terms end on the last day of the
   meeting.  A term may begin or end no sooner than the first day of the
   meeting and no later than the last day of the meeting as determined
   by the mutual agreement of the currently sitting member and the
   confirmed candidate.  A confirmed candidate's term may overlap the
   sitting member's term during the meeting as determined by their
   mutual agreement.

   For confirmed candidates of the IAB, the terms overlap with the terms
   of the sitting members for the entire week of the meeting.

   For confirmed Trustee candidates of the IETF Trust, the term begins
   at the next IETF Trust meeting or as dictated by the policies and
   procedures of the IETF Trust.

   For confirmed Director candidates of the IETF LLC, the term begins at
   the next appropriate IETF LLC Board meeting or as dictated by the
   policies and procedures of the IETF LLC Board.

   For candidates confirmed under the mid-term vacancy rules, the term
   begins as soon as possible after the confirmation.

3.5.  Mid-term Vacancies

   Mid-term vacancies are filled by the same rules as documented here
   with four qualifications, namely:

   1.  When there is only one official NomCom, the body with the mid-
       term vacancy relegates the responsibility to fill the vacancy to
       it.  If the mid-term vacancy occurs during the period of time
       that the term of the prior year's NomCom overlaps with the term
       of the current year's NomCom, the body with the mid-term vacancy
       must relegate the responsibility to fill the vacancy to the prior
       year's NomCom.

   2.  If it is the case that the NomCom is reconvening to fill the mid-
       term vacancy, then the completion of the candidate selection and
       confirmation process is due within six weeks, with all other time
       periods otherwise unspecified prorated accordingly.

   3.  The confirming body has two weeks from the day it is notified of
       a candidate to reject the candidate, otherwise the candidate is
       assumed to have been confirmed.

   4.  The term of the confirmed candidate will be either:

       A.  the remainder of the term of the open position if that
           remainder is not less than one year or

       B.  the remainder of the term of the open position plus the next
           two-year term for IESG and IAB positions or three-year term
           for IETF LLC Director and IETF Trust positions if that
           remainder is less than one year.

   In both cases, a year is the period of time from a First IETF meeting
   to the next First IETF meeting.

3.6.  Confidentiality

   All deliberations and supporting information that relate to specific
   nominees, candidates, and confirmed candidates are confidential.

   The NomCom and confirming body members will be exposed to
   confidential information as a result of their deliberations, their
   interactions with those they consult, and from those who provide
   requested supporting information.  All members and all other
   participants are expected to handle this information in a manner
   consistent with its sensitivity.

   It is consistent with this rule for current NomCom members who have
   served on prior NomComs to advise the current committee on
   deliberations and results of the prior committee, as necessary and
   appropriate.

   The list of nominees willing to be considered for positions under
   review in the current NomCom cycle is not confidential.  The NomCom
   may disclose a list of names of nominees who are willing to be
   considered for positions under review to the community, in order to
   obtain feedback from the community on these nominees.

   The list of nominees disclosed for a specific position should contain
   only the names of nominees who are willing to be considered for the
   position under review.

   The NomCom may choose not to include some names in the disclosed
   list, at their discretion.

   The NomCom may disclose an updated list, at its discretion.  For
   example, the NomCom might disclose an updated list if it identifies
   errors/omissions in a previously disclosed version of the disclosed
   list, or if the NomCom finds it necessary to call for additional
   nominees, and these nominees indicate a willingness to be considered
   before the NomCom has completed its deliberations.

   Nominees may choose to ask people to provide feedback to the NomCom
   but should not encourage any public statements of support.  NomComs
   should consider nominee-encouraged lobbying and campaigning to be
   unacceptable behavior.

   IETF community members are encouraged to provide feedback on nominees
   to the NomCom but should not post statements of support/non-support
   for nominees in any public forum.

3.7.  Advice and Consent Model

   Unless otherwise specified, the advice and consent model is used
   throughout the process.  This model is characterized as follows.

3.7.1.  Positions to Be Reviewed

   The Chairs of the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, and IETF LLC Board each
   informs the NomCom of their respective positions to be reviewed.

   The IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, and IETF LLC are responsible for providing
   a summary of the expertise desired of the candidates selected for
   their respective open positions.  The summaries are provided to the
   NomCom for its consideration.

3.7.2.  Candidate Selection

   The NomCom selects candidates based on its understanding of the IETF
   community's consensus of the qualifications required and advises each
   confirming body of its respective candidates.

3.7.3.  Candidate Review

   The confirming bodies review their respective candidates; they may at
   their discretion communicate with the NomCom, and then consent to
   some, all, or none of the candidates.

   The sitting IAB members review the IESG candidates.

   The Internet Society Board of Trustees reviews the IAB candidates.

   The sitting IESG members review the IETF Trust Trustee candidates.

   The IETF LLC Director candidate is reviewed as specified in
   [RFC8711].

   The confirming bodies conduct their reviews using all information and
   any means acceptable to them, including but not limited to the
   supporting information provided by the NomCom, information known
   personally to members of the confirming bodies and shared within the
   confirming body, the results of interactions within the confirming
   bodies, and the confirming bodies' interpretation of what is in the
   best interests of the IETF community.

   If all of the candidates are confirmed, the job of the NomCom with
   respect to those open positions is complete.

   If some or none of the candidates submitted to a confirming body are
   confirmed, the confirming body should communicate with the NomCom
   both to explain the reason why all the candidates were not confirmed
   and to understand the NomCom's rationale for its candidates.

   The confirming body may reject individual candidates, in which case
   the NomCom must select alternate candidates for the rejected
   candidates.

   Any additional time required by the NomCom should not exceed its
   maximum time allotment.

3.7.4.  Confirmation

   A confirming body decides whether it confirms each candidate using a
   confirmation decision rule chosen by the confirming body.

   If a confirming body has no specific confirmation decision rule, then
   confirming a given candidate should require at least one-half of the
   confirming body's sitting members to agree to that confirmation.

   The decision may be made by conducting a formal vote, by asserting
   consensus based on informal exchanges (e.g., email), or by any other
   mechanism that is used to conduct the normal business of the
   confirming body.

   Regardless of which decision rule the confirming body uses, any
   candidate that is not confirmed under that rule is considered to be
   rejected.

   The confirming body must make its decision within a reasonable time
   frame.  The results from the confirming body must be reported
   promptly to the NomCom.

3.8.  Sitting Members, Directors, and Trustees

   The following rules apply to nominees and candidates who are
   currently sitting members of the IESG or IAB, IETF Trust Trustees, or
   IETF LLC Directors, and who are not sitting in an open position being
   filled by the NomCom.

   The confirmation of a candidate to an open position does not
   automatically create a vacancy in the IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, or IETF
   LLC Board position currently occupied by the candidate.  The mid-term
   vacancy cannot exist until, first, the candidate formally resigns
   from the current position and, second, the body with the vacancy
   formally decides for itself that it wants the NomCom to fill the mid-
   term vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term vacancy documented
   elsewhere in this document.

   The resignation should be effective as of when the term of the new
   position begins.  The resignation may remain confidential to the
   IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, IETF LLC Board, and NomCom until the confirmed
   candidate is announced for the new position.  The process, according
   to rules set out elsewhere in this document, of filling the seat
   vacated by the confirmed candidate may begin as soon as the vacancy
   is publicly announced.

   Filling a mid-term vacancy is a separate and independent action from
   the customary action of filling open positions.  In particular, a
   NomCom must complete its job with respect to filling the open
   positions and then separately proceed with the task of filling the
   mid-term vacancy according to the rules for a mid-term vacancy
   documented elsewhere in this document.

   However, the following exception is permitted in the case where the
   candidate for an open position is currently a sitting member of the
   IAB.  It is consistent with these rules for the announcements of a
   resignation of a sitting member of the IAB and of the confirmed
   candidate for the mid-term vacancy created by that sitting member on
   the IAB to all occur at the same time as long as the actual sequence
   of events that occurred did so in the following order:

   1.  The NomCom completes the advice and consent process for the open
       position being filled by the candidate currently sitting on the
       IAB.

   2.  The newly confirmed candidate resigns from their current position
       on the IAB.

   3.  The IAB Chair (or the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat, if no
       Chair has been named or the vacancy was created via the departure
       of the IAB Chair) informs the NomCom of the mid-term vacancy.

   4.  The NomCom acts on the request to fill the mid-term vacancy.

3.9.  Announcements

   All announcements must be made using at least the mechanism used by
   the IETF Secretariat for its announcements, including a notice on the
   IETF web site.

   As of the publication of this document, the current mechanism is an
   email message to both the "ietf" and the "ietf-announce" mailing
   lists.

4.  Nominating Committee Selection

   The following set of rules apply to the creation of the NomCom and
   the selection of its members.

4.1.  Timeline

   The completion of the process of selecting and organizing the members
   of the NomCom is due within three months.

   The completion of the selection and organization process is due at
   least one month prior to the Third IETF.  This ensures the NomCom is
   fully operational and available for interviews and consultation
   during the Third IETF.

4.2.  Term

   The term of a NomCom is expected to be 15 months.

   It is the intent of this rule that the end of a NomCom's term overlap
   by approximately three months the beginning of the term of the next
   NomCom.

   The term of a NomCom begins when its members are officially
   announced.  The term ends at the Third IETF (not three meetings),
   i.e., the IETF meeting after the next NomCom's term begins.

   A term is expected to begin at least two months prior to the Third
   IETF to ensure the NomCom has at least one month to get organized
   before preparing for the Third IETF.

   A NomCom is expected to complete any work in progress before it is
   dissolved at the end of its term.

   During the period of time when the terms of the NomComs overlap, all
   mid-term vacancies are to be relegated to the prior year's NomCom.
   The prior year's NomCom has no other responsibilities during the
   overlap period.  At all times other than the overlap period, there is
   exactly one official NomCom and it is responsible for all mid-term
   vacancies.

   When the prior year's NomCom is filling a mid-term vacancy during the
   period of time that the terms overlap, the NomComs operate
   independently.  However, some coordination is needed between them.
   Since the prior year's Chair is a non-voting advisor to the current
   NomCom, the coordination is expected to be straightforward.

4.3.  Structure

   The NomCom comprises at least a Chair, 10 voting volunteers, two
   liaisons, and an advisor.

   Any committee member may propose the addition of an advisor to
   participate in some or all of the deliberations of the committee.
   The addition must be approved by the committee according to its
   established voting mechanism.  Advisors participate as individuals.

   Committee members are encouraged to propose the addition of
   advisor(s) who are knowledgeable about the operations of the IETF
   Trust and/or IETF LLC Board, whether or not that NomCom is reviewing
   an IETF Trust Trustee or IETF LLC Director position.  The NomCom may
   choose to ask the IETF Trust and/or IETF LLC Board to suggest
   advisors who are knowledgeable about their operations but may select
   any advisor they vote to approve.

   Any committee member may propose the addition of a liaison from other
   unrepresented organizations to participate in some or all of the
   deliberations of the committee.  The addition must be approved by the
   committee according to its established voting mechanism.  Liaisons
   participate as representatives of their respective organizations.

   The Chair is selected according to rules stated elsewhere in this
   document.

   The 10 voting volunteers are selected according to rules stated
   elsewhere in this document.

   The IESG and IAB liaisons are selected according to rules stated
   elsewhere in this document.

   The Internet Society Board of Trustees may appoint a liaison to the
   NomCom at its own discretion.

   The IETF Trust may appoint a liaison to the NomCom at its own
   discretion.

   The IETF LLC Board may appoint a liaison to the NomCom at its own
   discretion.

   The Chair of the prior year's NomCom serves as an advisor according
   to rules stated elsewhere in this document.

   The Chair, liaisons, and advisors do not vote on the selection of
   candidates.  They do vote on all other issues before the committee
   unless otherwise specified in this document.

4.4.  Chair Duties

   The Chair of the NomCom is responsible for ensuring the NomCom
   completes its assigned duties in a timely fashion and performs in the
   best interests of the IETF community.

   The Chair must be thoroughly familiar with the rules and guidance
   indicated throughout this document.  The Chair must ensure the NomCom
   completes its assigned duties in a manner that is consistent with
   this document.

   The Chair must attest by proclamation at a plenary session of the
   First IETF that the results of the committee represent its best
   effort and the best interests of the IETF community.

   The Chair does not vote on the selection of candidates.

4.5.  Chair Selection

   The Internet Society President appoints the Chair, who must meet the
   same requirements for membership in the NomCom as a voting volunteer.

   The NomCom Chair must agree to invest the time necessary to ensure
   that the NomCom completes its assigned duties and to perform in the
   best interests of the IETF community in that role.

   The appointment is due no later than the Second IETF meeting to
   ensure it can be announced during a plenary session at that meeting.
   The completion of the appointment is necessary to ensure the annual
   process can complete at the time specified elsewhere in this
   document.

4.6.  Temporary Chair

   A Chair, in consultation with the Internet Society President, may
   appoint a temporary substitute for the Chair position.

   There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise from
   time to time that could result in a Chair being unavailable to
   oversee the activities of the committee.  The Chair, in consultation
   with the Internet Society President, may appoint a substitute from a
   pool comprised of the liaisons currently serving on the committee and
   the prior year's Chair or designee.

   Any such appointment must be temporary and does not absolve the Chair
   of any or all responsibility for ensuring the NomCom completes its
   assigned duties in a timely fashion.

4.7.  Liaisons

   Liaisons are responsible for ensuring the NomCom in general and the
   Chair in particular execute their assigned duties in the best
   interests of the IETF community.

   Liaisons are expected to represent the views of their respective
   organizations during the deliberations of the committee.  They should
   provide information as requested or when they believe it would be
   helpful to the committee.

   Liaisons are expected to provide information to the NomCom regarding
   the operation, responsibility, and composition of their respective
   bodies.

   Liaisons are expected to convey questions from the committee to their
   respective organizations and responses to those questions to the
   committee, as requested by the committee.

   Liaisons are expected to review the operation and executing process
   of the NomCom and to report any concerns or issues to the Chair of
   the NomCom immediately.  If they cannot resolve the issue between
   themselves, liaisons must report it according to the dispute
   resolution process stated elsewhere in this document.

   Liaisons from confirming bodies are expected to assist the committee
   in preparing the testimony it is required to provide with its
   candidates.

   Liaisons may have other NomCom responsibilities as required by their
   respective organizations or requested by the NomCom, except that such
   responsibilities may not conflict with any other provisions of this
   document.

   Liaisons do not vote on the selection of candidates.

4.8.  Liaison Appointment

   The sitting IAB and IESG members each appoint someone from their
   current membership who is not sitting in an open position to serve as
   a liaison to the NomCom.

   The sitting IETF Trust Trustees and IETF LLC Directors each may
   appoint a liaison from their current membership, someone who is not
   sitting in an open position, to serve on the NomCom.

4.9.  Advisors

   An advisor is responsible for such duties as specified by the
   invitation that resulted in the appointment.

   Advisors do not vote on the selection of candidates.

4.10.  Past Chair

   The Chair of the prior year's NomCom serves as an advisor to the
   current committee.

   The prior year's Chair is expected to review the actions and
   activities of the current Chair and to report any concerns or issues
   to the NomCom Chair immediately.  If they cannot resolve the issue
   between themselves, the prior year's Chair must report it according
   to the dispute resolution process stated elsewhere in this document.

   The prior year's Chair may select a designee from a pool composed of
   the voting volunteers of the prior year's committee and all prior
   Chairs if the Chair is unavailable.  If the prior year's Chair is
   unavailable or is unable or unwilling to make such a designation in a
   timely fashion, the Chair of the current year's committee may select
   a designee in consultation with the Internet Society President.

   Selecting a prior year's committee member as the designee permits the
   experience of the prior year's deliberations to be readily available
   to the current committee.  Selecting an earlier prior year Chair as
   the designee permits the experience of being a Chair as well as that
   Chair's committee deliberations to be readily available to the
   current committee.

   All references to "prior year's Chair" in this document refer to the
   person serving in that role, whether it is the actual prior year's
   Chair or a designee.

4.11.  Voting Volunteers

   Voting volunteers are responsible for completing the tasks of the
   NomCom in a timely fashion.

   Each voting volunteer is expected to participate in all activities of
   the NomCom with a level of effort approximately equal to all other
   voting volunteers.  Specific tasks to be completed are established
   and managed by the Chair according to rules stated elsewhere in this
   document.

4.12.  Milestones

   The Chair must establish and announce milestones for the selection of
   the NomCom members.

   There is a defined time period during which the selection process is
   due to be completed.  The Chair must establish a set of milestones
   which, if met in a timely fashion, will result in the completion of
   the process on time.

4.13.  Open Positions

   The Chair (or the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat, if no Chair
   has been named four weeks after the First IETF meeting of the year)
   obtains the list of positions to be reviewed and announces it along
   with a solicitation for names of volunteers from the IETF community
   willing to serve on the NomCom.

   If the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat, issues the solicitation
   for volunteers, the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat, must also
   collect responses to the solicitation and provide the names of
   volunteers to the incoming NomCom Chair when the incoming NomCom
   Chair is named.

   At the Chair's request, the IETF Secretariat may perform other
   clerical support tasks, as long as the task being performed does not
   require NomCom Chair judgment, in the NomCom Chair's opinion, and as
   long as the community is appropriately notified that this request is
   being made.  This request may come from the incoming NomCom Chair (if
   one has been selected for this NomCom cycle) or the previous NomCom
   Chair (if the search for an incoming NomCom Chair is still underway).

   The solicitation must permit the community at least 30 days during
   which they may choose to volunteer to be selected for the NomCom.

   The list of open positions is published with the solicitation to
   facilitate community members choosing between volunteering for an
   open position and volunteering for the NomCom.

4.14.  Volunteer Qualification

   Members of the IETF community must have attended at least three of
   the last five IETF meetings in order to volunteer.

   The five meetings are the five most recent meetings that ended prior
   to the date on which the solicitation for NomCom volunteers was
   submitted for distribution to the IETF community.

   The IETF Secretariat is responsible for confirming that volunteers
   have met the attendance requirement.

   Volunteers must provide their full name, email address, and primary
   company or organization affiliation (if any) when volunteering.

   Volunteers are expected to be familiar with the IETF processes and
   procedures, which are readily learned by active participation in a
   working group and especially by serving as a document editor or
   working group chair.

4.15.  Not Qualified

   Any person who serves on the Internet Society Board of Trustees, the
   IETF Trust, the IETF LLC Board of Directors, the IAB, or the IESG,
   including those who serve on these bodies in ex officio positions,
   may not volunteer to serve as voting members of the NomCom.  In
   addition, employees or contractors of the IETF LLC may not volunteer
   to serve as voting members of the NomCom.  Liaisons to these bodies
   from other bodies or organizations are not excluded by this rule.

4.16.  Selection Process

   The Chair announces both the list of the pool of volunteers from
   which the 10 voting volunteers will be randomly selected and the
   method with which the selection will be completed.

   The announcement should be made at least one week prior to the date
   on which the random selection will occur.

   The pool of volunteers must be enumerated or otherwise indicated
   according to the needs of the selection method to be used.

   The announcement must specify the data that will be used as input to
   the selection method.  The method must depend on random data whose
   value is not known or available until the date on which the random
   selection will occur.

   It must be possible to independently verify that the selection method
   used is both fair and unbiased.  A method is fair if each eligible
   volunteer is equally likely to be selected.  A method is unbiased if
   no one can influence its outcome in favor of a specific outcome.

   It must be possible to repeat the selection method, either through
   iteration or by restarting in such a way as to remain fair and
   unbiased.  This is necessary to replace selected volunteers should
   they become unavailable after selection.

   The selection method must produce an ordered list of volunteers.

   One possible selection method is described in [RFC3797].

4.17.  Announcement of Selection Results

   The Chair randomly selects the 10 voting volunteers from the pool of
   names of volunteers and announces the members of the NomCom.

   No more than two volunteers with the same primary affiliation may be
   selected for the NomCom.  The Chair reviews the primary affiliation
   of each volunteer selected by the method in turn.  If the primary
   affiliation for a volunteer is the same as two previously selected
   volunteers, that volunteer is removed from consideration and the
   method is repeated to identify the next eligible volunteer.

   There must be at least two announcements of all members of the
   NomCom.

   The first announcement should occur as soon after the random
   selection as is reasonable for the Chair.  The community must have at
   least one week during which any member may challenge the results of
   the random selection.

   The challenge must be made in writing (email is acceptable) to the
   Chair.  The Chair has 48 hours to review the challenge and offer a
   resolution to the member.  If the resolution is not accepted by the
   member, that member may report the challenge according to the dispute
   resolution process stated elsewhere in this document.

   If a selected volunteer, upon reading the announcement with the list
   of selected volunteers, finds that two or more other volunteers have
   the same affiliation, then the volunteer should notify the Chair who
   will determine the appropriate action.

   During at least the one week challenge period, the Chair must contact
   each of the members and confirm their willingness and availability to
   serve.  The Chair should make every reasonable effort to contact each
   member.

   *  If the Chair is unable to contact a liaison, the problem is
      referred to the respective organization to resolve.  The Chair
      should allow a reasonable amount of time for the organization to
      resolve the problem and then may proceed without the liaison.

   *  If the Chair is unable to contact an advisor, the Chair may elect
      to proceed without the advisor, except for the prior year's Chair
      for whom the Chair must consult with the Internet Society
      President as stated elsewhere in this document.

   *  If the Chair is unable to contact a voting volunteer, the Chair
      must repeat the random selection process in order to replace the
      unavailable volunteer.  There should be at least one day between
      the announcement of the iteration and the selection process.

   After at least one week and confirming that 10 voting volunteers are
   ready to serve, the Chair makes the second announcement of the
   members of the NomCom, which officially begins the term of the
   NomCom.

4.18.  Committee Organization

   The Chair works with the members of the committee to organize itself
   in preparation for completing its assigned duties.

   The committee has approximately one month during which it can self-
   organize.  Its responsibilities during this time include but are not
   limited to the following:

   *  Setting up a regular teleconference schedule.

   *  Setting up an internal web site.

   *  Setting up a mailing list for internal discussions.

   *  Setting up an email address for receiving community input.

   *  Establishing operational procedures.

   *  Establishing milestones in order to monitor the progress of the
      selection process.

5.  Nominating Committee Operation

   The following rules apply to the operation of the NomCom.  If
   necessary, a paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is
   included.

   The rules are organized approximately in the order in which they
   would be invoked.

5.1.  Discretion

   All rules and special circumstances not otherwise specified are at
   the discretion of the committee.

   Exceptional circumstances will occasionally arise during the normal
   operation of the NomCom.  This rule is intended to foster the
   continued forward progress of the committee.

   Any member of the committee may propose a rule for adoption by the
   committee.  The rule must be approved by the committee according to
   its established voting mechanism.

   All members of the committee should consider whether the exception is
   worthy of mention in the next revision of this document and follow up
   accordingly.

5.2.  Selection Timeline

   The completion of the process of selecting candidates to be confirmed
   by their respective confirming body is due within three months.

   The completion of the selection process is due at least two months
   prior to the First IETF.  This ensures the NomCom has sufficient time
   to complete the confirmation process.

5.3.  Confirmation Timeline

   The completion of the process of confirming the candidates is due
   within one month.

   The completion of the confirmation process is due at least one month
   prior to the First IETF.

5.4.  Milestones

   The Chair must establish a set of NomCom milestones for the candidate
   selection and confirmation process.

   There is a defined time period during which the candidate selection
   and confirmation process must be completed.  The Chair must establish
   a set of milestones that, if met in a timely fashion, will result in
   the completion of the process on time.  The Chair should allow time
   for iterating the activities of the committee if one or more
   candidates are not confirmed.

   The Chair should ensure that all committee members are aware of the
   milestones.

5.5.  Voting Mechanism

   The Chair must establish a voting mechanism.

   The committee must be able to objectively determine when a decision
   has been made during its deliberations.  The criteria for determining
   closure must be established and known to all members of the NomCom.

5.6.  Voting Quorum

   At least a quorum of committee members must participate in a vote.

   Only voting volunteers vote on a candidate selection.  For a
   candidate selection vote, a quorum is comprised of at least seven of
   the voting volunteers.

   At all other times, a quorum is present if at least 75% of the NomCom
   members are participating.

5.7.  Voting Member Recall

   Any member of the NomCom may propose to the committee that any other
   member except the Chair be recalled.  The process for recalling the
   Chair is defined elsewhere in this document.

   There are a variety of ordinary circumstances that may arise that
   could result in one or more members of the committee being
   unavailable to complete their assigned duties, for example, health
   concerns, family issues, or a change of priorities at work.  A
   committee member may choose to resign for unspecified personal
   reasons.  In addition, the committee may not function well as a group
   because a member may be disruptive or otherwise uncooperative.

   Regardless of the circumstances, if individual committee members
   cannot work out their differences between themselves, the entire
   committee may be called upon to discuss and review the circumstances.
   If a resolution is not forthcoming, a vote may be conducted.  A
   member may be recalled if at least a quorum of all committee members
   agree, including the vote of the member being recalled.

   If a liaison member is recalled, the committee must notify the
   affected organization and must allow a reasonable amount of time for
   a replacement to be identified by the organization before proceeding.

   If an advisor member other than the prior year's Chair is recalled,
   the committee may choose to proceed without the advisor.  In the case
   of the prior year's Chair, the Internet Society President must be
   notified and the current Chair must be allowed a reasonable amount of
   time to consult with the Internet Society President to identify a
   replacement before proceeding.

   If a single voting volunteer position on the NomCom is vacated,
   regardless of the circumstances, the committee may choose to proceed
   with only nine voting volunteers at its own discretion.  In all other
   cases, a new voting member must be selected, and the Chair must
   repeat the random selection process including an announcement of the
   iteration prior to the actual selection as stated elsewhere in this
   document.

   A change in the primary affiliation of a voting volunteer during the
   term of the NomCom is not a cause to request the recall of that
   volunteer, even if the change would result in more than two voting
   volunteers with the same affiliation.

5.8.  Chair Recall

   Only the prior year's Chair may request the recall of the current
   Chair.

   It is the responsibility of the prior year's Chair to ensure the
   current Chair completes the assigned tasks in a manner consistent
   with this document and in the best interests of the IETF community.

   Any member of the committee who has an issue or concern regarding the
   Chair should report it to the prior year's Chair immediately.  The
   prior year's Chair is expected to report it to the Chair immediately.
   If they cannot resolve the issue between themselves, the prior year's
   Chair must report it according to the dispute resolution process
   stated elsewhere in this document.

5.9.  Deliberations

   All members of the NomCom may participate in all deliberations.

   The emphasis of this rule is that no member can be explicitly
   excluded from any deliberation.  However, a member may individually
   choose not to participate in a deliberation.

5.10.  Call for Nominees

   The Chair announces the open positions to be reviewed, the desired
   expertise provided by the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat, and
   the call for nominees.

   The call for nominees must include a request for comments regarding
   the past performance of incumbents, which will be considered during
   the deliberations of the NomCom.

   The call must request that a nomination include a valid, working
   email address, a telephone number, or both for the nominee.  The
   nomination must include the set of skills or expertise the nominator
   believes the nominee has that would be desirable.

5.11.  Nominations

   Any member of the IETF community may nominate any member of the IETF
   community for any open position, whose eligibility to serve will be
   confirmed by the NomCom.

   A self-nomination is permitted.

   NomCom members are not eligible to be considered for filling any open
   position by the NomCom on which they serve.  They become ineligible
   as soon as the term of the NomCom on which they serve officially
   begins.  They remain ineligible for the duration of that NomCom's
   term.

   Although each NomCom's term overlaps with the following NomCom's
   term, NomCom members are eligible for nomination by the following
   committee if not otherwise disqualified.

   Members of the IETF community who were recalled from any IESG, IAB,
   IETF Trust, or IETF LLC Board position during the previous two years
   are not eligible to be considered for filling any open position.

5.12.  Candidate Selection

   The NomCom selects candidates based on its understanding of the IETF
   community's consensus of the qualifications required to fill the open
   positions.

   The intent of this rule is to ensure that the NomCom consults with a
   broad base of the IETF community for input to its deliberations.  In
   particular, the NomCom must determine if the desired expertise for
   the open positions matches its understanding of the qualifications
   desired by the IETF community.

   The consultations are permitted to include names of nominees, if all
   parties to the consultation agree to observe the same confidentiality
   rules as the NomCom itself, or the names are public as discussed in
   Section 3.6.  Feedback on individual nominees should always be
   confidential.

   A broad base of the community should include the existing members of
   the IESG and IAB, IETF Trust Trustees, and IETF LLC Directors,
   especially sitting members who share responsibilities with open
   positions, e.g., co-Area Directors, and working group chairs,
   especially those in the areas with open positions.

   Only voting volunteer members vote to select candidates.

5.13.  Consent to Nomination

   Nominees should be advised that they are being considered and must
   consent to their nomination prior to being chosen as candidates.

   Although the NomCom will make every reasonable effort to contact and
   to remain in contact with nominees, any nominee whose contact
   information changes during the process and who wishes to still be
   considered should inform the NomCom of the changes.

   A nominee's consent must be written (email is acceptable) and must
   include a commitment to provide the resources necessary to fill the
   open position and an assurance that the nominee will perform the
   duties of the position for which they are being considered in the
   best interests of the IETF community.

   Consenting to a nomination must occur prior to a nominee being a
   candidate and may occur as soon after the nomination as needed by the
   NomCom.

   Consenting to a nomination must not imply the nominee will be a
   candidate.

   The NomCom should help nominees provide justification to their
   employers.

5.14.  Notifying Confirming Bodies

   The NomCom advises the confirming bodies of their candidates,
   specifying a single candidate for each open position and testifying
   as to how each candidate meets the qualifications of an open
   position.

   For each candidate, the testimony must include a brief statement of
   the qualifications for the position that is being filled, which may
   be exactly the expertise that was requested.  If the qualifications
   differ from the expertise originally requested, a brief statement
   explaining the difference must be included.

   The testimony may include a brief resume of the candidate and/or a
   brief summary of the deliberations of the NomCom.

5.15.  Confirming Candidates

   Confirmed candidates must consent to their confirmation, and rejected
   candidates and nominees must be notified before confirmed candidates
   are announced.

   It is not necessary to notify and get consent from all confirmed
   candidates together.

   A nominee may not know they were a candidate.  This permits a
   candidate to be rejected by a confirming body without the nominee
   knowing about the rejection.

   Rejected nominees, who consented to their nomination, and rejected
   candidates must be notified prior to announcing the confirmed
   candidates.

   It is not necessary to announce all confirmed candidates together.

   The NomCom must ensure that all confirmed candidates are prepared to
   serve prior to announcing their confirmation.

5.16.  Archives

   The NomCom should archive the information it has collected or
   produced for a period of time but not to exceed its term.

   The purpose of the archive is to assist the NomCom should it be
   necessary for it to fill a mid-term vacancy.

   The existence of an archive, how it is implemented, and what
   information to archive is at the discretion of the committee.  The
   decision must be approved by a quorum of the voting volunteer
   members.

   The implementation of the archive should make every reasonable effort
   to ensure that the confidentiality of the information it contains is
   maintained.

6.  Dispute Resolution Process

   The dispute resolution process described here is to be used as
   indicated elsewhere in this document.  Its applicability in other
   circumstances is beyond the scope of this document.

   The NomCom operates under a strict rule of confidentiality.  For this
   reason, when process issues arise, it is best to make every
   reasonable effort to resolve them within the committee.  However,
   when circumstances do not permit this, or no resolution is
   forthcoming, the process described here is to be used.

   The following rules apply to the process:

   1.  The results of this process are final and binding.  There is no
       appeal.

   2.  The process begins with the submission of a request as described
       below to the Internet Society President.

   3.  As soon as the process begins, the NomCom may continue those
       activities that are unrelated to the issue to be resolved except
       that it must not submit any candidates to a confirming body until
       the issue is resolved.

   4.  All parties to the process are subject to the same
       confidentiality rules as each member of the NomCom.

   5.  The process should be completed within two weeks.

   The process is as follows:

   1.  The party seeking resolution submits a written request (email is
       acceptable) to the Internet Society President detailing the issue
       to be resolved.

   2.  The Internet Society President appoints an arbiter to investigate
       and resolve the issue.  A self-appointment is permitted.

   3.  The arbiter investigates the issue making every reasonable effort
       to understand both sides of the issue.  Since the arbiter is
       subject to the same confidentiality obligations as all NomCom
       members, all members are expected to cooperate fully with the
       arbiter and to provide all relevant information to the arbiter
       for review.

   4.  After consultation with the two principal parties to the issue,
       the arbiter decides on a resolution.  Whatever actions are
       necessary to execute the resolution are immediately begun and
       completed as quickly as possible.

   5.  The arbiter summarizes the issue, the resolution, and the
       rationale for the resolution for the Internet Society President.

   6.  In consultation with the Internet Society President, the arbiter
       prepares a report of the dispute and its resolution.  The report
       should include all information that in the judgment of the
       arbiter does not violate the confidentiality requirements of the
       NomCom.

   7.  The Chair includes the dispute report when reporting on the
       activities of the NomCom to the IETF community.

7.  Member, Trustee, and Director Recall

   The following rules apply to the recall process.  If necessary, a
   paragraph discussing the interpretation of each rule is included.

   It applies to IESG and IAB Members, the NomCom-appointed IETF Trust
   Trustees, and the NomCom-appointed IETF LLC Directors.

7.1.  Petition

   At any time, a signed petition (email is acceptable) may be submitted
   to the Internet Society President to request the recall of any
   sitting IESG or IAB member, or NomCom-appointed IETF Trust Trustee,
   or NomCom-appointed IETF LLC Director.  There are two different types
   of petitions: a petition by participants of the IETF community, and a
   petition by the Ombudsteam as described in [RFC7776].

7.1.1.  Community Petition

   A recall petition can be made by at least 20 members of the IETF
   community who are qualified to be voting members of a NomCom.  All
   individual and collective qualifications of NomCom eligibility are
   applicable, including that no more than two signatories may have the
   same primary affiliation.

   Each signature must include a full name, email address, and primary
   company or organization affiliation.

   The IETF Secretariat is responsible for confirming that each
   signatory is qualified to be a voting member of a NomCom.  A valid
   petition must be signed by at least 20 qualified signatories.

   The petition must include a statement of justification for the recall
   and all relevant and appropriate supporting documentation.

   The petition and its signatories must be announced to the IETF
   community.

7.1.2.  Ombudsteam Petition

   The Ombudsteam process allows the Ombudsteam to form a recall
   petition on its own without requiring 20 signatories from the
   community.  As defined in [RFC7776], the petition and its signatories
   (the Ombudsteam) shall be announced to the IETF community, and a
   Recall Committee Chair shall be appointed to complete the recall
   committee process.  It is expected that the recall committee will
   receive a briefing from the Ombudsteam explaining why recall is
   considered an appropriate remedy.

7.2.  Recall Committee Chair

   The Internet Society President shall appoint a Recall Committee
   Chair.

   The Internet Society President must not evaluate the recall request.
   It is explicitly the responsibility of the IETF community to evaluate
   the behavior of its leaders.

7.3.  Recall Committee Creation

   The recall committee is created according to the same rules as is the
   NomCom with the qualifications that both the person being
   investigated and the parties requesting the recall must not be a
   member of the recall committee in any capacity.

7.4.  Recall Committee Rules

   The recall committee operates according to the same rules as the
   NomCom with the qualification that there is no confirmation process.

7.5.  Recall Committee Operation

   The recall committee investigates the circumstances of the
   justification for the recall and votes on its findings.

   The investigation must include at least both an opportunity for the
   member being recalled to present a written statement and consultation
   with third parties.

7.6.  3/4 Majority

   A 3/4 majority of the members who vote on the question is required
   for a recall.

7.7.  Position to Be Filled

   If a sitting member is recalled, the open position is to be filled
   according to the mid-term vacancy rules.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

9.  Security Considerations

   Any selection, confirmation, or recall process necessarily involves
   investigation into the qualifications and activities of prospective
   candidates.  The investigation may reveal confidential or otherwise
   private information about candidates to those participating in the
   process.  Each person who participates in any aspect of the process
   must maintain the confidentiality of any and all information not
   explicitly identified as suitable for public dissemination.

   When the NomCom decides it is necessary to share confidential or
   otherwise private information with others, the dissemination must be
   minimal and must include a prior commitment from all persons
   consulted to observe the same confidentiality rules as the NomCom
   itself.

Appendix A.  Changes Since RFC 3777

   *  Converted source file from nroff to XML, resulting in some
      reformatting.

   *  Applied errata for RFC 3777 ([Err232] and [Err4179]).

   *  Applied RFC 5078 update.

   *  Applied RFC 5633 update.

   *  Applied RFC 5680 update.

   *  Applied RFC 6859 update.

   *  Corrected a few grammatical errors.

   *  Added a reference to RFC 3710.

Appendix B.  Changes Since RFC 7437

   *  Changed all mentions of the Internet Administrative Oversight
      committee (IAOC), and replaced it with the appropriate references
      to the IETF Administration LLC (IETF LLC).  This included making
      changes on an as needed basis to some aspects of the process for
      the IETF LLC, in accordance with IASA2.

   *  Revised definition of IETF Executive Director, and added
      definition of "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat".  Changed text
      to "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" where appropriate.

   *  Added references to appropriate IASA2 documents.

   *  Modified the Advice and Consent model to enable IESG, IAB, and
      IETF LLC to communicate directly with the NomCom rather than via
      the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat.

   *  Updated removal text to reflect the new LLC rules, which enables
      removal via the LLC or the IETF recall process, except for the
      ISOC-appointed Director.

   *  Updated the document to clarify that there are members of the IAB
      and IESG, Trustees of the IETF Trust, and Director of the IETF
      LLC.

      appointed IETF Trust Trustees.

   *  Revised Abstract and Introduction to provide current context.

   *  Changed "nominating committee" to "NomCom" throughout the document
      because it is what most use to describe the IETF Nominating
      Committee.

   *  Added that the IETF Trust Trustees and IETF LLC Directors, each
      may appoint a liaison to the NomCom.

   *  Incorporated the update to RFC 7437 done by [RFC7776].

   *  Incorporated the update to RFC 7437 done by [RFC8318] and updated
      it to refer to the IETF Trust and IETF LLC, instead of the IAOC.

   *  Editorial changes.

Appendix C.  Oral Tradition

   Over the years, various NomComs have learned through oral tradition
   passed on by liaisons that there are certain consistencies in the
   process and information considered during deliberations.  Some items
   from that oral tradition are collected here to facilitate its
   consideration by future NomComs.

   1.  It has been found that experience as an IETF Working Group Chair
       or an IRTF Research Group Chair is helpful in giving a nominee
       experience of what the job of an Area Director involves.  It also
       helps a NomCom judge the technical, people, and process
       management skills of the nominee.

   2.  No person should serve both on the IAB and as an Area Director,
       except the IETF Chair whose roles as an IAB member and Area
       Director of the General Area are set out elsewhere.

   3.  The strength of the IAB is found in part in the balance of the
       demographics of its members (e.g., national distribution, years
       of experience, gender, etc.), the combined skill set of its
       members, and the combined sectors (e.g., industry, academia,
       etc.) represented by its members.

   4.  There are no term limits for IAB and IESG members explicitly
       because the issue of continuity versus turnover should be
       evaluated each year according to the expectations of the IETF
       community, as it is understood by each NomCom.

   5.  The number of NomCom members with the same primary affiliation is
       limited in order to avoid the appearance of improper bias in
       choosing the leadership of the IETF.  Rather than defining
       precise rules for how to define "affiliation", the IETF community
       depends on the honor and integrity of the participants to make
       the process work.

Appendix D.  Nominating Committee Timeline

   This appendix is included for the convenience of the reader and is
   not to be interpreted as the definitive timeline.  It is intended to
   capture the detail described elsewhere in this document in one place.
   Although every effort has been made to ensure the description here is
   consistent with the description elsewhere, if there are any conflicts
   the definitive rule is the one in the main body of this document.

   The only absolute in the timeline rules for the annual process is
   that its completion is due by the First IETF of the year after the
   NomCom begins its term.  This is supported by the fact that the
   confirmed candidate terms begin during the week of the First IETF.

   The overall annual process is designed to be completed in seven
   months.  It is expected to start nine months prior to the First IETF.
   The time is split between three major components of the process
   roughly as follows:

   1.  First is the selection and organization of the committee members.
       Three months are allotted for this process.

   2.  Second is the selection of the candidates by the NomCom.  Four
       months are allotted for this process.

   3.  Third is the confirmation of the candidates by their respective
       confirming bodies.  Two months are allotted for this process.

   The following list captures the details of the milestones within each
   component.  For illustrative purposes, the list presumes the Friday
   before the First IETF is March 1.  Numbers shown in square brackets
   indicate the expected number of weeks at each step.

   1.   BEGIN Eight Months Prior to First IETF (approx.  June 1);
        Internet Society President appoints the Chair.  The appointment
        must be done no later than the Second IETF or eight months prior
        to the First IETF, whichever comes first.  The Chair must be
        announced and recognized during a plenary session of the Second
        IETF. [0]

   2.   The Chair establishes and announces milestones to ensure the
        timely selection of the NomCom members. [1]

   3.   The Chair contacts the IESG, IAB, and Internet Society Board of
        Trustees, IETF Trust, and IETF LLC and requests a liaison.  The
        Chair contacts the prior year's Chair and requests an advisor.
        The Chair obtains the list of IESG, IAB, IETF Trust, and IETF
        LLC open positions and descriptions from the chairs of each
        group. [0]

   4.   The Chair announces the solicitation for voting volunteer
        members that must remain open for at least 30 days.  The
        announcement must be done no later than seven months and two
        weeks prior to the First IETF (approx.  June 15). [6]

   5.   After the solicitation closes, the Chair announces the pool of
        volunteers and the date of the random selection, which must be
        at least one week in the future.  The announcement must be done
        no later than six months and two weeks prior to the First IETF
        (approx.  July 15). [1]

   6.   On the appointed day, the random selection occurs and the Chair
        announces the members of the committee and the one week
        challenge period.  The announcement must be done no later than
        six months and one week prior to the First IETF (approx.  July
        22). [1]

   7.   During the challenge period, the Chair contacts each of the
        committee members and confirms their availability to
        participate.  [0]

   8.   After the challenge period closes, the Chair announces the
        members of the committee and its term begins.  The announcement
        must be done no later than six months prior to the First IETF
        (approx.  August 1). [1]

   9.   The committee has one month during which it is to self-organize
        in preparation for completing its assigned duties.  This must be
        done no later than five months prior to the First IETF (approx.
        September 15). [6]

   10.  END the Committee Member Selection Process; BEGIN the Selection
        of Candidates; Time is at least five months prior to the First
        IETF (approx.  September 22). [0]

   11.  The Chair establishes and announces the milestones to ensure the
        timely selection of the candidates, including a call for
        nominations for the open positions.  The announcement must be
        done no later than five months prior to the First IETF (approx.
        October 1). [1]

   12.  Over the next three months, the NomCom collects input and
        deliberates.  It should plan to conduct interviews and other
        consultations during the Third IETF.  The committee is due to
        complete its candidate selection no later than two months prior
        to the First IETF (approx.  January 1). [17]

   13.  END the Selection of Candidates; BEGIN the Confirmation of
        Candidates; Time is at least two months prior to the First IETF
        (approx.  January 1). [0]

   14.  The committee presents its candidates to their respective
        confirming bodies.  The presentation must be done no later than
        two months prior to the First IETF (approx.  January 1). [0]

   15.  The confirming bodies have one month to deliberate and, in
        communication with the NomCom, accept or reject candidates. [4]

   16.  The Chair notifies and advises unsuccessful nominees that they
        have not been selected. [1]

   17.  The Chair announces the confirmed candidates.  The announcement
        must be done no later than one month prior to the First IETF
        (approx.  February 1). [4]
