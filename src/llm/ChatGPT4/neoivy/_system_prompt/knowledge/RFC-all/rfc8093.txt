1.  Introduction

   It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values have
   been used in BGP implementations that have been deployed in the wild
   while not being assigned by IANA for such usage.  Unregistered usage
   of BGP Path Attribute values can lead to deployment problems for new
   technologies.

   The use of these unregistered values was noticed when the BGP Large
   Communities attribute [RFC8092] was initially assigned value 30 by
   IANA.  It was subsequently discovered that a widely deployed BGP-4
   [RFC4271] implementation had released code that used path attribute
   30 and that applied a "Treat-as-withdraw" [RFC7606] strategy to
   routes containing a valid Large Community attribute, since it was
   expecting a different data structure.  Because these routes were
   dropped, early adopters of Large Communities were unreachable from
   parts of the Internet.  As a workaround, a new Early IANA Allocation
   was requested.

   The squatting of values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242, and 243 has been
   confirmed by the involved vendors or through source code review.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has marked values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242, and 243 as "Deprecated"
   in the "BGP Path Attributes" subregistry under the "Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) Parameters" registry.  The marking "Deprecated" means
   "use is not recommended" ([IANA-GUIDELINES]).

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
