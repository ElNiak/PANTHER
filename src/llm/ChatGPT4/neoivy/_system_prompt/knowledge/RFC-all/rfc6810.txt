    The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol

Abstract

   In order to verifiably validate the origin Autonomous Systems of BGP
   announcements, routers need a simple but reliable mechanism to
   receive Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RFC 6480) prefix origin
   data from a trusted cache.  This document describes a protocol to
   deliver validated prefix origin data to routers.

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


1.  Introduction

   In order to verifiably validate the origin Autonomous Systems (ASes)
   of BGP announcements, routers need a simple but reliable mechanism to
   receive Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480]
   cryptographically validated prefix origin data from a trusted cache.
   This document describes a protocol to deliver validated prefix origin
   data to routers.  The design is intentionally constrained to be
   usable on much of the current generation of ISP router platforms.

   Section 3 describes the deployment structure, and Section 4 then
   presents an operational overview.  The binary payloads of the
   protocol are formally described in Section 5, and the expected PDU
   sequences are described in Section 6.  The transport protocol options
   are described in Section 7.  Section 8 details how routers and caches
   are configured to connect and authenticate.  Section 9 describes
   likely deployment scenarios.  The traditional security and IANA
   considerations end the document.

   The protocol is extensible in order to support new PDUs with new
   semantics, if deployment experience indicates they are needed.  PDUs
   are versioned should deployment experience call for change.

   For an implementation (not interoperability) report, see [RTR-IMPL]

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]
   only when they appear in all upper case.  They may also appear in
   lower or mixed case as English words, without special meaning.

2.  Glossary

   The following terms are used with special meaning.

   Global RPKI:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are published in a
      distributed set of servers at the IANA, Regional Internet
      Registries (RIRs), National Internet Registry (NIRs), and ISPs;
      see [RFC6481].

   Cache:  A coalesced copy of the RPKI, which is periodically fetched/
      refreshed directly or indirectly from the Global RPKI using the
      [RFC5781] protocol/tools.  Relying party software is used to
      gather and validate the distributed data of the RPKI into a cache.
      Trusting this cache further is a matter between the provider of
      the cache and a relying party.

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


   Serial Number:  A 32-bit strictly increasing unsigned integer that
      wraps from 2^32-1 to 0.  It denotes the logical version of a
      cache.  A cache increments the value when it successfully updates
      its data from a parent cache or from primary RPKI data.  As a
      cache is receiving, new incoming data and implicit deletes are
      associated with the new serial but MUST NOT be sent until the
      fetch is complete.  A Serial Number is not commensurate between
      caches, nor need it be maintained across resets of the cache
      server.  See [RFC1982] on DNS Serial Number Arithmetic for too
      much detail on the topic.

   Session ID:  When a cache server is started, it generates a session
      identifier to uniquely identify the instance of the cache and to
      bind it to the sequence of Serial Numbers that cache instance will
      generate.  This allows the router to restart a failed session
      knowing that the Serial Number it is using is commensurate with
      that of the cache.

3.  Deployment Structure

   Deployment of the RPKI to reach routers has a three-level structure
   as follows:

   Global RPKI:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are published in a
      distributed set of servers, RPKI publication repositories, e.g.,
      the IANA, RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs, see [RFC6481].

   Local Caches:  A local set of one or more collected and verified
      caches.  A relying party, e.g., router or other client, MUST have
      a trust relationship with, and a trusted transport channel to, any
      authoritative cache(s) it uses.

   Routers:  A router fetches data from a local cache using the protocol
      described in this document.  It is said to be a client of the
      cache.  There MAY be mechanisms for the router to assure itself of
      the authenticity of the cache and to authenticate itself to the
      cache.

4.  Operational Overview

   A router establishes and keeps open a connection to one or more
   caches with which it has client/server relationships.  It is
   configured with a semi-ordered list of caches, and establishes a
   connection to the most preferred cache, or set of caches, which
   accept the connections.






Bush & Austein               Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


   The router MUST choose the most preferred, by configuration, cache or
   set of caches so that the operator may control load on their caches
   and the Global RPKI.

   Periodically, the router sends to the cache the Serial Number of the
   highest numbered data it has received from that cache, i.e., the
   router's current Serial Number.  When a router establishes a new
   connection to a cache, or wishes to reset a current relationship, it
   sends a Reset Query.

   The Cache responds with all data records that have Serial Numbers
   greater than that in the router's query.  This may be the null set,
   in which case the End of Data PDU is still sent.  Note that 'greater'
   must take wrap-around into account, see [RFC1982].

   When the router has received all data records from the cache, it sets
   its current Serial Number to that of the Serial Number in the End of
   Data PDU.

   When the cache updates its database, it sends a Notify message to
   every currently connected router.  This is a hint that now would be a
   good time for the router to poll for an update, but is only a hint.
   The protocol requires the router to poll for updates periodically in
   any case.

   Strictly speaking, a router could track a cache simply by asking for
   a complete data set every time it updates, but this would be very
   inefficient.  The Serial Number based incremental update mechanism
   allows an efficient transfer of just the data records that have
   changed since last update.  As with any update protocol based on
   incremental transfers, the router must be prepared to fall back to a
   full transfer if for any reason the cache is unable to provide the
   necessary incremental data.  Unlike some incremental transfer
   protocols, this protocol requires the router to make an explicit
   request to start the fallback process; this is deliberate, as the
   cache has no way of knowing whether the router has also established
   sessions with other caches that may be able to provide better
   service.

   As a cache server must evaluate certificates and ROAs (Route Origin
   Attestations; see [RFC6480]), which are time dependent, servers'
   clocks MUST be correct to a tolerance of approximately an hour.

5.  Protocol Data Units (PDUs)

   The exchanges between the cache and the router are sequences of
   exchanges of the following PDUs according to the rules described in
   Section 6.

   Fields with unspecified content MUST be zero on transmission and MAY
   be ignored on receipt.

5.1.  Fields of a PDU

   PDUs contain the following data elements:

   Protocol Version:  An eight-bit unsigned integer, currently 0,
      denoting the version of this protocol.

   PDU Type:  An eight-bit unsigned integer, denoting the type of the
      PDU, e.g., IPv4 Prefix, etc.

   Serial Number:  The Serial Number of the RPKI Cache when this set of
      PDUs was received from an upstream cache server or gathered from
      the Global RPKI.  A cache increments its Serial Number when
      completing a rigorously validated update from a parent cache or
      the Global RPKI.

   Session ID:  When a cache server is started, it generates a Session
      ID to identify the instance of the cache and to bind it to the
      sequence of Serial Numbers that cache instance will generate.
      This allows the router to restart a failed session knowing that
      the Serial Number it is using is commensurate with that of the
      cache.  If, at any time, either the router or the cache finds the
      value of the session identifier is not the same as the other's,
      they MUST completely drop the session and the router MUST flush
      all data learned from that cache.

      Should a cache erroneously reuse a Session ID so that a router
      does not realize that the session has changed (old session ID and
      new session ID have same numeric value), the router may become
      confused as to the content of the cache.  The time it takes the
      router to discover it is confused will depend on whether the
      Serial Numbers are also reused.  If the Serial Numbers in the old
      and new sessions are different enough, the cache will respond to
      the router's Serial Query with a Cache Reset, which will solve the
      problem.  If, however, the Serial Numbers are close, the cache may
      respond with a Cache Response, which may not be enough to bring
      the router into sync.  In such cases, it's likely but not certain
      that the router will detect some discrepancy between the state
      that the cache expects and its own state.  For example, the Cache



Bush & Austein               Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


      Response may tell the router to drop a record that the router does
      not hold, or may tell the router to add a record that the router
      already has.  In such cases, a router will detect the error and
      reset the session.  The one case in which the router may stay out
      of sync is when nothing in the Cache Response contradicts any data
      currently held by the router.

      Using persistent storage for the session identifier or a clock-
      based scheme for generating session identifiers should avoid the
      risk of session identifier collisions.

      The Session ID might be a pseudo-random value, a strictly
      increasing value if the cache has reliable storage, etc.

   Length:  A 32-bit unsigned integer that has as its value the count of
      the bytes in the entire PDU, including the eight bytes of header
      that end with the length field.

   Flags:  The lowest order bit of the Flags field is 1 for an
      announcement and 0 for a withdrawal, whether this PDU announces a
      new right to announce the prefix or withdraws a previously
      announced right.  A withdraw effectively deletes one previously
      announced IPvX (IPv4 or IPv6) Prefix PDU with the exact same
      Prefix, Length, Max-Len, and Autonomous System Number (ASN).

   Prefix Length:  An 8-bit unsigned integer denoting the shortest
      prefix allowed for the prefix.

   Max Length:  An 8-bit unsigned integer denoting the longest prefix
      allowed by the prefix.  This MUST NOT be less than the Prefix
      Length element.

   Prefix:  The IPv4 or IPv6 prefix of the ROA.

   Autonomous System Number:  ASN allowed to announce this prefix, a
      32-bit unsigned integer.

   Zero:  Fields shown as zero or reserved MUST be zero.  The value of
      such a field MUST be ignored on receipt.

5.2.  Serial Notify

   The cache notifies the router that the cache has new data.

   The Session ID reassures the router that the Serial Numbers are
   commensurate, i.e., the cache session has not been changed.

   Serial Notify is the only message that the cache can send that is not
   in response to a message from the router.

5.3.  Serial Query

   Serial Query: The router sends Serial Query to ask the cache for all
   payload PDUs that have Serial Numbers higher than the Serial Number
   in the Serial Query.

   The cache replies to this query with a Cache Response PDU
   (Section 5.5) if the cache has a, possibly null, record of the
   changes since the Serial Number specified by the router.  If there
   have been no changes since the router last queried, the cache sends
   an End Of Data PDU.

   If the cache does not have the data needed to update the router,
   perhaps because its records do not go back to the Serial Number in
   the Serial Query, then it responds with a Cache Reset PDU
   (Section 5.9).

   The Session ID tells the cache what instance the router expects to
   ensure that the Serial Numbers are commensurate, i.e., the cache
   session has not been changed.

   `-------------------------------------------'

5.4.  Reset Query

   Reset Query: The router tells the cache that it wants to receive the
   total active, current, non-withdrawn database.  The cache responds
   with a Cache Response PDU (Section 5.5).

   |                                           |
   `-------------------------------------------'

5.5.  Cache Response

   Cache Response: The cache responds with zero or more payload PDUs.
   When replying to a Serial Query request (Section 5.3), the cache
   sends the set of all data records it has with Serial Numbers greater
   than that sent by the client router.  When replying to a Reset Query,
   the cache sends the set of all data records it has; in this case, the
   withdraw/announce field in the payload PDUs MUST have the value 1
   (announce).

   In response to a Reset Query, the new value of the Session ID tells
   the router the instance of the cache session for future confirmation.
   In response to a Serial Query, the Session ID being the same
   reassures the router that the Serial Numbers are commensurate, i.e.,
   the cache session has not changed.

   The lowest order bit of the Flags field is 1 for an announcement and
   0 for a withdrawal.

   In the RPKI, nothing prevents a signing certificate from issuing two
   identical ROAs.  In this case, there would be no semantic difference
   between the objects, merely a process redundancy.

   In the RPKI, there is also an actual need for what might appear to a
   router as identical IPvX PDUs.  This can occur when an upstream
   certificate is being reissued or there is an address ownership
   transfer up the validation chain.  The ROA would be identical in the

   router sense, i.e., have the same {Prefix, Len, Max-Len, ASN}, but a
   different validation path in the RPKI.  This is important to the
   RPKI, but not to the router.

   The cache server MUST ensure that it has told the router client to
   have one and only one IPvX PDU for a unique {Prefix, Len, Max-Len,
   ASN} at any one point in time.  Should the router client receive an
   IPvX PDU with a {Prefix, Len, Max-Len, ASN} identical to one it
   already has active, it SHOULD raise a Duplicate Announcement Received

5.8.  End of Data

   End of Data: The cache tells the router it has no more data for the
   request.

   The Session ID MUST be the same as that of the corresponding Cache
   Response that began the, possibly null, sequence of data PDUs.

   The cache may respond to a Serial Query informing the router that the
   cache cannot provide an incremental update starting from the Serial
   Number specified by the router.  The router must decide whether to
   issue a Reset Query or switch to a different cache.

5.10.  Error Report

   This PDU is used by either party to report an error to the other.

   Error reports are only sent as responses to other PDUs.

   The Error Code is described in Section 10.

   If the error is generic (e.g., "Internal Error") and not associated
   with the PDU to which it is responding, the Erroneous PDU field MUST
   be empty and the Length of Encapsulated PDU field MUST be zero.

   An Error Report PDU MUST NOT be sent for an Error Report PDU.  If an
   erroneous Error Report PDU is received, the session SHOULD be
   dropped.

   If the error is associated with a PDU of excessive length, i.e., too
   long to be any legal PDU other than another Error Report, or a
   possibly corrupt length, the Erroneous PDU field MAY be truncated.

   The diagnostic text is optional; if not present, the Length of Error
   Text field MUST be zero.  If error text is present, it MUST be a
   string in UTF-8 encoding (see [RFC3269]).

6.  Protocol Sequences

   The sequences of PDU transmissions fall into three conversations as
   follows:

6.1.  Start or Restart

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <----- Reset Query -------- | R requests data (or Serial Query)
     |                             |
     | ----- Cache Response -----> | C confirms request
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> | C sends zero or more
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> |   IPv4 and IPv6 Prefix
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> |   Payload PDUs
     | ------  End of Data ------> | C sends End of Data
     |                             |   and sends new serial
     ~                             ~

   When a transport session is first established, the router MAY send a
   Reset Query and the cache responds with a data sequence of all data
   it contains.

   Alternatively, if the router has significant unexpired data from a
   broken session with the same cache, it MAY start with a Serial Query
   containing the Session ID from the previous session to ensure the
   Serial Numbers are commensurate.

   This Reset Query sequence is also used when the router receives a
   Cache Reset, chooses a new cache, or fears that it has otherwise lost
   its way.

   To limit the length of time a cache must keep the data necessary to
   generate incremental updates, a router MUST send either a Serial
   Query or a Reset Query no less frequently than once an hour.  This
   also acts as a keep-alive at the application layer.

   As the cache MAY not keep updates for little more than one hour, the
   router MUST have a polling interval of no greater than once an hour.

6.2.  Typical Exchange

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | -------- Notify ----------> |  (optional)
     |                             |
     | <----- Serial Query ------- | R requests data
     |                             |
     | ----- Cache Response -----> | C confirms request
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> | C sends zero or more
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> |   IPv4 and IPv6 Prefix
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> |   Payload PDUs
     | ------  End of Data ------> | C sends End of Data
     |                             |   and sends new serial
     ~                             ~

   The cache server SHOULD send a notify PDU with its current Serial
   Number when the cache's serial changes, with the expectation that the
   router MAY then issue a Serial Query earlier than it otherwise might.
   This is analogous to DNS NOTIFY in [RFC1996].  The cache MUST rate
   limit Serial Notifies to no more frequently than one per minute.

   When the transport layer is up and either a timer has gone off in the
   router, or the cache has sent a Notify, the router queries for new
   data by sending a Serial Query, and the cache sends all data newer
   than the serial in the Serial Query.

   To limit the length of time a cache must keep old withdraws, a router
   MUST send either a Serial Query or a Reset Query no less frequently
   than once an hour.

6.3.  No Incremental Update Available

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <-----  Serial Query ------ | R requests data
     | ------- Cache Reset ------> | C cannot supply update
     |                             |   from specified serial
     | <------ Reset Query ------- | R requests new data
     | ----- Cache Response -----> | C confirms request
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> | C sends zero or more
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> |   IPv4 and IPv6 Prefix
     | ------- IPvX Prefix ------> |   Payload PDUs
     | ------  End of Data ------> | C sends End of Data
     |                             |   and sends new serial
     ~                             ~

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


   The cache may respond to a Serial Query with a Cache Reset, informing
   the router that the cache cannot supply an incremental update from
   the Serial Number specified by the router.  This might be because the
   cache has lost state, or because the router has waited too long
   between polls and the cache has cleaned up old data that it no longer
   believes it needs, or because the cache has run out of storage space
   and had to expire some old data early.  Regardless of how this state
   arose, the cache replies with a Cache Reset to tell the router that
   it cannot honor the request.  When a router receives this, the router
   SHOULD attempt to connect to any more preferred caches in its cache
   list.  If there are no more preferred caches, it MUST issue a Reset
   Query and get an entire new load from the cache.

6.4.  Cache Has No Data Available

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <-----  Serial Query ------ | R requests data
     | ---- Error Report PDU ----> | C No Data Available
     ~                             ~

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <-----  Reset Query ------- | R requests data
     | ---- Error Report PDU ----> | C No Data Available
     ~                             ~

   The cache may respond to either a Serial Query or a Reset Query
   informing the router that the cache cannot supply any update at all.
   The most likely cause is that the cache has lost state, perhaps due
   to a restart, and has not yet recovered.  While it is possible that a
   cache might go into such a state without dropping any of its active
   sessions, a router is more likely to see this behavior when it
   initially connects and issues a Reset Query while the cache is still
   rebuilding its database.

   When a router receives this kind of error, the router SHOULD attempt
   to connect to any other caches in its cache list, in preference
   order.  If no other caches are available, the router MUST issue
   periodic Reset Queries until it gets a new usable load from the
   cache.

7.  Transport

   The transport-layer session between a router and a cache carries the
   binary PDUs in a persistent session.

   To prevent cache spoofing and DoS attacks by illegitimate routers, it
   is highly desirable that the router and the cache be authenticated to
   each other.  Integrity protection for payloads is also desirable to
   protect against monkey-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  Unfortunately,
   there is no protocol to do so on all currently used platforms.
   Therefore, as of the writing of this document, there is no mandatory-
   to-implement transport that provides authentication and integrity
   protection.

   To reduce exposure to dropped but non-terminated sessions, both
   caches and routers SHOULD enable keep-alives when available in the
   chosen transport protocol.

   It is expected that, when the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)
   [RFC5925] is available on all platforms deployed by operators, it
   will become the mandatory-to-implement transport.

   Caches and routers MUST implement unprotected transport over TCP
   using a port, rpki-rtr (323); see Section 12.  Operators SHOULD use
   procedural means, e.g., access control lists (ACLs), to reduce the
   exposure to authentication issues.

   Caches and routers SHOULD use TCP-AO, SSHv2, TCP MD5, or IPsec
   transport.

   If unprotected TCP is the transport, the cache and routers MUST be on
   the same trusted and controlled network.

   If available to the operator, caches and routers MUST use one of the
   following more protected protocols.

   Caches and routers SHOULD use TCP-AO transport [RFC5925] over the
   rpki-rtr port.

   Caches and routers MAY use SSHv2 transport [RFC4252] using a the
   normal SSH port.  For an example, see Section 7.1.

   Caches and routers MAY use TCP MD5 transport [RFC2385] using the
   rpki-rtr port.  Note that TCP MD5 has been obsoleted by TCP-AO
   [RFC5925].

   Caches and routers MAY use IPsec transport [RFC4301] using the rpki-
   rtr port.



Bush & Austein               Standards Track                   [Page 17]

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


   Caches and routers MAY use TLS transport [RFC5246] using a port,
   rpki-rtr-tls (324); see Section 12.

7.1.  SSH Transport

   To run over SSH, the client router first establishes an SSH transport
   connection using the SSHv2 transport protocol, and the client and
   server exchange keys for message integrity and encryption.  The
   client then invokes the "ssh-userauth" service to authenticate the
   application, as described in the SSH authentication protocol
   [RFC4252].  Once the application has been successfully authenticated,
   the client invokes the "ssh-connection" service, also known as the
   SSH connection protocol.

   After the ssh-connection service is established, the client opens a
   channel of type "session", which results in an SSH session.

   Once the SSH session has been established, the application invokes
   the application transport as an SSH subsystem called "rpki-rtr".
   Subsystem support is a feature of SSH version 2 (SSHv2) and is not
   included in SSHv1.  Running this protocol as an SSH subsystem avoids
   the need for the application to recognize shell prompts or skip over
   extraneous information, such as a system message that is sent at
   shell start-up.

   It is assumed that the router and cache have exchanged keys out of
   band by some reasonably secured means.

   Cache servers supporting SSH transport MUST accept RSA and Digital
   Signature Algorithm (DSA) authentication and SHOULD accept Elliptic
   Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) authentication.  User
   authentication MUST be supported; host authentication MAY be
   supported.  Implementations MAY support password authentication.
   Client routers SHOULD verify the public key of the cache to avoid
   monkey-in-the-middle attacks.

7.2.  TLS Transport

   Client routers using TLS transport MUST present client-side
   certificates to authenticate themselves to the cache in order to
   allow the cache to manage the load by rejecting connections from
   unauthorized routers.  In principle, any type of certificate and
   certificate authority (CA) may be used; however, in general, cache
   operators will wish to create their own small-scale CA and issue
   certificates to each authorized router.  This simplifies credential
   rollover; any unrevoked, unexpired certificate from the proper CA may
   be used.

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


   Certificates used to authenticate client routers in this protocol
   MUST include a subjectAltName extension [RFC5280] containing one or
   more iPAddress identities; when authenticating the router's
   certificate, the cache MUST check the IP address of the TLS
   connection against these iPAddress identities and SHOULD reject the
   connection if none of the iPAddress identities match the connection.

   Routers MUST also verify the cache's TLS server certificate, using
   subjectAltName dNSName identities as described in [RFC6125], to avoid
   monkey-in-the-middle attacks.  The rules and guidelines defined in
   [RFC6125] apply here, with the following considerations:

      Support for DNS-ID identifier type (that is, the dNSName identity
      in the subjectAltName extension) is REQUIRED in rpki-rtr server
      and client implementations that use TLS.  Certification
      authorities that issue rpki-rtr server certificates MUST support
      the DNS-ID identifier type, and the DNS-ID identifier type MUST be
      present in rpki-rtr server certificates.

      DNS names in rpki-rtr server certificates SHOULD NOT contain the
      wildcard character "*".

      rpki-rtr implementations that use TLS MUST NOT use CN-ID
      identifiers; a CN field may be present in the server certificate's
      subject name, but MUST NOT be used for authentication within the
      rules described in [RFC6125].

      The client router MUST set its "reference identifier" to the DNS
      name of the rpki-rtr cache.

7.3.  TCP MD5 Transport

   If TCP MD5 is used, implementations MUST support key lengths of at
   least 80 printable ASCII bytes, per Section 4.5 of [RFC2385].
   Implementations MUST also support hexadecimal sequences of at least
   32 characters, i.e., 128 bits.

   Key rollover with TCP MD5 is problematic.  Cache servers SHOULD
   support [RFC4808].

7.4.  TCP-AO Transport

   Implementations MUST support key lengths of at least 80 printable
   ASCII bytes.  Implementations MUST also support hexadecimal sequences
   of at least 32 characters, i.e., 128 bits.  MAC (Message
   Authentication Code) lengths of at least 96 bits MUST be supported,
   per Section 5.1 of [RFC5925].

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


   The cryptographic algorithms and associated parameters described in
   [RFC5926] MUST be supported.

8.  Router-Cache Setup

   A cache has the public authentication data for each router it is
   configured to support.

   A router may be configured to peer with a selection of caches, and a
   cache may be configured to support a selection of routers.  Each must
   have the name of, and authentication data for, each peer.  In
   addition, in a router, this list has a non-unique preference value
   for each server.  This preference merely denotes proximity, not
   trust, preferred belief, etc.  The client router attempts to
   establish a session with each potential serving cache in preference
   order, and then starts to load data from the most preferred cache to
   which it can connect and authenticate.  The router's list of caches
   has the following elements:

   Preference:  An unsigned integer denoting the router's preference to
      connect to that cache; the lower the value, the more preferred.

   Name:  The IP address or fully qualified domain name of the cache.

   Key:  Any needed public key of the cache.

   MyKey:  Any needed private key or certificate of this client.

   Due to the distributed nature of the RPKI, caches simply cannot be
   rigorously synchronous.  A client may hold data from multiple caches
   but MUST keep the data marked as to source, as later updates MUST
   affect the correct data.

   Just as there may be more than one covering ROA from a single cache,
   there may be multiple covering ROAs from multiple caches.  The
   results are as described in [RFC6811].

   If data from multiple caches are held, implementations MUST NOT
   distinguish between data sources when performing validation.

   When a more preferred cache becomes available, if resources allow, it
   would be prudent for the client to start fetching from that cache.

   The client SHOULD attempt to maintain at least one set of data,
   regardless of whether it has chosen a different cache or established
   a new connection to the previous cache.





Bush & Austein               Standards Track                   [Page 20]

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


   A client MAY drop the data from a particular cache when it is fully
   in sync with one or more other caches.

   A client SHOULD delete the data from a cache when it has been unable
   to refresh from that cache for a configurable timer value.  The
   default for that value is twice the polling period for that cache.

   If a client loses connectivity to a cache it is using, or otherwise
   decides to switch to a new cache, it SHOULD retain the data from the
   previous cache until it has a full set of data from one or more other
   caches.  Note that this may already be true at the point of
   connection loss if the client has connections to more than one cache.

9.  Deployment Scenarios

   For illustration, we present three likely deployment scenarios.

   Small End Site:  The small multihomed end site may wish to outsource
      the RPKI cache to one or more of their upstream ISPs.  They would
      exchange authentication material with the ISP using some out-of-
      band mechanism, and their router(s) would connect to the cache(s)
      of one or more upstream ISPs.  The ISPs would likely deploy caches
      intended for customer use separately from the caches with which
      their own BGP speakers peer.

   Large End Site:  A larger multihomed end site might run one or more
      caches, arranging them in a hierarchy of client caches, each
      fetching from a serving cache that is closer to the Global RPKI.
      They might configure fall-back peerings to upstream ISP caches.

   ISP Backbone:  A large ISP would likely have one or more redundant
      caches in each major point of presence (PoP), and these caches
      would fetch from each other in an ISP-dependent topology so as not
      to place undue load on the Global RPKI.

   Experience with large DNS cache deployments has shown that complex
   topologies are ill-advised as it is easy to make errors in the graph,
   e.g., not maintain a loop-free condition.

   Of course, these are illustrations and there are other possible
   deployment strategies.  It is expected that minimizing load on the
   Global RPKI servers will be a major consideration.

   To keep load on Global RPKI services from unnecessary peaks, it is
   recommended that primary caches that load from the distributed Global
   RPKI not do so all at the same times, e.g., on the hour.  Choose a
   random time, perhaps the ISP's AS number modulo 60 and jitter the
   inter-fetch timing.

10.  Error Codes

   This section contains a preliminary list of error codes.  The authors
   expect additions to the list this section during development of the
   initial implementations.  There is an IANA registry where valid error
   codes are listed; see Section 12.  Errors that are considered fatal
   SHOULD cause the session to be dropped.

   0: Corrupt Data (fatal):  The receiver believes the received PDU to
      be corrupt in a manner not specified by other error codes.

   1: Internal Error (fatal):  The party reporting the error experienced
      some kind of internal error unrelated to protocol operation (ran
      out of memory, a coding assertion failed, et cetera).

   2: No Data Available:  The cache believes itself to be in good
      working order, but is unable to answer either a Serial Query or a
      Reset Query because it has no useful data available at this time.
      This is likely to be a temporary error, and most likely indicates
      that the cache has not yet completed pulling down an initial
      current data set from the Global RPKI system after some kind of
      event that invalidated whatever data it might have previously held
      (reboot, network partition, et cetera).

   3: Invalid Request (fatal):  The cache server believes the client's
      request to be invalid.

   4: Unsupported Protocol Version (fatal):  The Protocol Version is not
      known by the receiver of the PDU.

   5: Unsupported PDU Type (fatal):  The PDU Type is not known by the
      receiver of the PDU.

   6: Withdrawal of Unknown Record (fatal):  The received PDU has Flag=0
      but a record for the {Prefix, Len, Max-Len, ASN} tuple does not
      exist in the receiver's database.

   7: Duplicate Announcement Received (fatal):  The received PDU has an
      identical {Prefix, Len, Max-Len, ASN} tuple as a PDU that is still
      active in the router.

11.  Security Considerations

   As this document describes a security protocol, many aspects of
   security interest are described in the relevant sections.  This
   section points out issues that may not be obvious in other sections.

   Cache Validation:  In order for a collection of caches as described
      in Section 9 to guarantee a consistent view, they need to be given
      consistent trust anchors to use in their internal validation
      process.  Distribution of a consistent trust anchor is assumed to
      be out of band.

   Cache Peer Identification:  The router initiates a transport session
      to a cache, which it identifies by either IP address or fully
      qualified domain name.  Be aware that a DNS or address spoofing
      attack could make the correct cache unreachable.  No session would
      be established, as the authorization keys would not match.

   Transport Security:  The RPKI relies on object, not server or
      transport, trust.  That is, the IANA root trust anchor is
      distributed to all caches through some out-of-band means, and can
      then be used by each cache to validate certificates and ROAs all
      the way down the tree.  The inter-cache relationships are based on
      this object security model; hence, the inter-cache transport can
      be lightly protected.

      But, this protocol document assumes that the routers cannot do the
      validation cryptography.  Hence, the last link, from cache to
      router, is secured by server authentication and transport-level
      security.  This is dangerous, as server authentication and
      transport have very different threat models than object security.

      So, the strength of the trust relationship and the transport
      between the router(s) and the cache(s) are critical.  You're
      betting your routing on this.

      While we cannot say the cache must be on the same LAN, if only due
      to the issue of an enterprise wanting to off-load the cache task
      to their upstream ISP(s), locality, trust, and control are very
      critical issues here.  The cache(s) really SHOULD be as close, in
      the sense of controlled and protected (against DDoS, MITM)
      transport, to the router(s) as possible.  It also SHOULD be
      topologically close so that a minimum of validated routing data
      are needed to bootstrap a router's access to a cache.

      The identity of the cache server SHOULD be verified and
      authenticated by the router client, and vice versa, before any
      data are exchanged.



Bush & Austein               Standards Track                   [Page 23]

RFC 6810                  RPKI-Router Protocol              January 2013


      Transports that cannot provide the necessary authentication and
      integrity (see Section 7) must rely on network design and
      operational controls to provide protection against spoofing/
      corruption attacks.  As pointed out in Section 7, TCP-AO is the
      long-term plan.  Protocols that provide integrity and authenticity
      SHOULD be used, and if they cannot, i.e., TCP is used as the
      transport, the router and cache MUST be on the same trusted,
      controlled network.

12.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned 'well-known' TCP Port Numbers to the RPKI-Router
   Protocol for the following, see Section 7:

           rpki-rtr
           rpki-rtr-tls

   IANA has created a registry for tuples of Protocol Version / PDU
   Type, each of which may range from 0 to 255.  The name of the
   registry is "rpki-rtr-pdu".  The policy for adding to the registry is
   RFC Required per [RFC5226], either Standards Track or Experimental.
   The initial entries are as follows:

           Protocol   PDU
           Version    Type  Description
           --------   ----  ---------------
               0        0   Serial Notify
               0        1   Serial Query
               0        2   Reset Query
               0        3   Cache Response
               0        4   IPv4 Prefix
               0        6   IPv6 Prefix
               0        7   End of Data
               0        8   Cache Reset
               0       10   Error Report
               0      255   Reserved

   IANA has created a registry for Error Codes 0 to 255.  The name of
   the registry is "rpki-rtr-error".  The policy for adding to the
   registry is Expert Review per [RFC5226], where the responsible IESG
   Area Director should appoint the Expert Reviewer.  The initial
   entries should be as follows:

               7   Duplicate Announcement Received
             255   Reserved

   IANA has added an SSH Connection Protocol Subsystem Name, as defined
   in [RFC4250], of 'rpki-rtr'.
