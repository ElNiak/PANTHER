1.  Introduction

   Multi-pair bonding using Time-Division Inverse Multiplexing (TDIM),
   a.k.a. G.Bond/TDIM, is specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3
   [G.998.3], which defines a method for bonding (or aggregating)
   multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer channels in multiple xDSL
   lines) into a single bidirectional logical link carrying a mix of
   various traffic streams, e.g., Ethernet, Asynchronous Transfer Mode
   (ATM), Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM).

   The MIB module defined in this document provides G.Bond/TDIM-specific
   objects for the management of G.998.3 bonded interfaces, extending
   the common bonding objects specified in the GBOND-MIB [RFC6765]
   module.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   "Management Framework for xDSL Bonding" [TR-159], defining a
   management model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded
   xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and the G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

4.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces Group MIB Module

   A G.Bond/TDIM port is a private case of a bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular, an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/TDIM ports, as
   well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to the G.Bond MIB Module

   The GBOND-MIB module [RFC6765] defines management objects common for
   all bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In particular, it describes
   the bonding management, bonded port and channel configuration,
   initialization sequence, etc.

RFC 6766                     G.Bond/TDIM MIB               February 2013


   Both the GBOND-MIB and G9983-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   All management objects defined in the G9983-MIB module are contained
   in a single group g9983Port.  This group is further split into 6
   sub-groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:

   o  g9983PortNotifications - containing notifications (TDIM Service
      'down'/'up').

   o  g9983PortConfTable - containing objects for configuration of a
      G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  g9983PortCapTable - containing objects reflecting capabilities of
      a G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  g9983PortStatTable - containing objects providing overall status
      information of a G.Bond/TDIM port, complementing the generic
      status information from the ifTable of the IF-MIB and the
      gBondPortStatFltStatus of GBOND-MIB.

   o  g9983SvcTable - containing objects for configuration and status of
      the services in a G.Bond/TDIM port.

   o  g9983PM - containing objects for OPTIONAL historical Performance
      Monitoring (PM) of a G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.2.  Link Protection Configuration

   The G.Bond/TDIM specification allows an optional Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) and Interleaver block, which if supported and
   enabled provides a degree of protection against micro-interruptions,
   alien noise, and even individual Bonding Channel Entity (BCE)
   failures, a.k.a. cut-line protection.

   Management objects in the g9983PortConfTable can be used to configure
   and query the FEC and Interleaver function of the G.Bond/TDIM port.

5.3.  Service Configuration

   Unlike the other two xDSL Multi-Pair Bonding schemes (G.Bond/ATM and
   G.Bond/Ethernet), which send the information required for reassembly
   of the fragmented data along with the data, G.Bond/TDIM is a
   synchronous scheme, requiring both ends to know the data distribution
   tables before any actual data transfer can happen.

   Management objects in the g9983PortConfTable
   (g9983PortConfAdminServices), g9983SvcTable, and g9983OperSvcTable
   can be used to configure and query the configuration of services
   transported via the G.Bond/TDIM link.  The services may be configured
   independently of the link state (i.e., in-service and out-of-
   service), as G.998.3 communicates changes in the service
   configuration via specific Bonding Communication Channel (BCC)
   messages, switching both ends of the link to the new configuration
   synchronously.

   There can be up to 60 active services defined on a G.Bond/TDIM link.
   This MIB module provides an ability to define up to 255 services via
   the g9983SvcTable, with each row representing a possible service, and
   then set the actual service configuration using the
   g9983PortConfAdminServices object (a byte-vector of service indices),
   listing the active services in the order of their position in the
   G.Bond/TDIM frame.  This design allows one to easily modify service
   drop priority, which directly corresponds to the service position.

   The actual list of services is provided via the read-only
   g9983OperSvcTable, where each entry's index corresponds to the
   service position, starting from index 1 for the first entry, 2 for
   the second entry, etc., providing an easy service navigation for a
   management application using GET-NEXT (instead of counting bytes in
   the g9983PortConfAdminServices object).

   The service configuration can only be changed on a Bonding
   Terminating Unit at the Central Office (BTU-C).

   When configuring the services, please bear in mind that the sum of
   all the services' bandwidth SHOULD be less than or equal to the
   target data rate of the bonded link.  Note that G.Bond/TDIM links are
   symmetrical; i.e., their upstream data rate equals the downstream
   data rate.

5.3.1.  Management of TDM Services and Service Drop Priority during
        Bandwidth Degradation

   The G.Bond/TDIM protocol provides an ability to map TDM services into
   the TDIM bonded link directly, without any additional overhead.  It
   addresses only structure-agnostic TDM transport, disregarding any
   structure that may be imposed on these streams, in particular, the
   structure imposed by the standard TDM framing [G.704].

   During bandwidth degradation, services with a lower priority are
   impaired or dropped first.  Synchronous services (fractional DS1/E1,
   clear channel E1/T1, T3/E3, clock) that are positioned in the
   beginning of the G.Bond/TDIM frame have higher priority than
   asynchronous services (Ethernet, ATM, Generic Framing Procedure (GFP)
   encapsulated) that are positioned farther away.  Within the services
   of the same type, those with a lower position (index) have higher
   priority.

5.3.2.  Service Notifications

   This MIB module provides specific 'up'/'down' notifications
   (g9983SvcUp/g9983SvcDown) for each of the configured services.
   During bandwidth degradation, a number of services may be suspended
   (dropped) simultaneously, according to their drop priority (position
   in the service list).  Please note that it is possible for a higher-
   priority service to be dropped before a lower-priority one.  For
   example, suppose there are two services configured on a 2-Mbps
   G.Bond/TDIM link: a T1 service (g9983SvcType with a value of ds1,
   with a bandwidth requirement of 1.5 Mbps), and an Ethernet service
   with a size of 0.5 Mbps.  When the actual link bandwidth is reduced
   to 1.4 Mbps, the T1 service with a g9983OperSvcPosition value of 1
   would be dropped, while the Ethernet service with a
   g9983OperSvcPosition value of 2 would remain up.

   Notifications SHOULD be rate-limited (throttled) such that there is
   an implementation-specific gap between the generation of consecutive
   notifications of the same event.  This mechanism prevents
   "notification flooding" in cases where g9983OperSvcState oscillates
   between the 'up' and 'down' states.  When notifications are rate-
   limited, they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future
   time.  This is intended to be a general rate-limiting statement for
   notifications that otherwise have no explicit rate-limiting
   assertions in this document.

5.4.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history
   buckets (interval-counters), similar to those defined in [TR-159],
   are implemented using the textual conventions defined in the
   HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit
   versions of the textual conventions found in the PerfHist-TC-MIB
   [RFC3593].

   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen-
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each
   one-day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a G.Bond TDIM port is re-initialized, but
   rather only when the agent is reset or re-initialized.

   Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a
   monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of
   service unavailability on that entity.  The DESCRIPTION clause of
   Performance Monitoring counters in this MIB module specifies which of
   the counters are inhibited during periods of service unavailability.

5.5.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 and ITU-T G.998.3 Managed
      Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and the managed objects defined in
   this document.  Note that all management objects defined in [G.998.3]
   have corresponding objects in [TR-159].

   Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR-159
   and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one-to-one; for
   example, while TR-159 PM attributes aGroupPerf* map to the
   corresponding gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, there are
   no dedicated PM attributes for the g9983PortPm* and g9983SvcPm*
   objects introduced in this MIB module.  However, since their
   definition is identical to the definition of gBondPortPm* objects of
   the GBOND-MIB module, we can map g9983PortPm* and g9983SvcPm* to the
   relevant aGroupPerf* attributes of TR-159 and use the term 'partial
   mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping is not one-to-one.

    DESCRIPTION
      "The objects in this MIB module are used to manage the
      multi-pair bonded xDSL interfaces using time-division inverse
      multiplexing (TDIM), as defined in ITU-T Recommendation G.998.3
      (G.Bond/TDIM).

      This MIB module MUST be used in conjunction with the GBOND-MIB
      module, common to all G.Bond technologies.

      The following references are used throughout this MIB module:

       An octet's position reflects the associated service position
       and its priority in the G.Bond/TDIM frame, with the first octet
       being the first service of highest priority.

       A zero-length octet string is object-specific and MUST
       therefore be defined as part of the description of any object
       that uses this syntax.  Examples of the usage of a zero-length
       value might include situations where an object using this
       textual convention is irrelevant for a specific G.Bond/TDIM port
       type or where no services have been defined for this port."

7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Changing of the g9983PortConfAdminServices object may lead to a
      potential service disruption, by changing a particular service's
      position (therefore changing its drop priority) or even removing
      the service from the link altogether.

   o  Changing of g9983SvcTable configuration parameters (e.g.,
      g9983SvcType or g9983SvcSize) may lead to a potential service
      impairment; for example, a TDM service would be dropped if there
      is not enough actual bandwidth on the bonded link to support this
      service.

   o  Changing of g9983PortConfTable configuration parameters (e.g.,
      g9983PortConfFecAdminState) may lead to anything from link quality
      and rate degradation to a complete link initialization failure.

RFC 6766                     G.Bond/TDIM MIB               February 2013


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., those with
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they
   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and
   can reveal some aspects of their configuration.

   In particular, since a bonded xDSL port can be comprised of multiple
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice-grade copper, located in the same
   bundle with other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is
   theoretically possible to eavesdrop on a G.Bond transmission, simply
   by "listening" to cross-talk from the bonded pairs, especially if the
   operating parameters of the G.Bond link in question are known.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.  These are the
   tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  g9983PortStatFecOperState in the g9983PortStatTable indicates
      whether the FEC function is enabled, which may aid in deciphering
      the G.Bond/TDIM transmissions.

   o  The g9983OperSvcTable provides current operational service
      configuration, which may aid in deciphering the G.Bond/TDIM
      transmissions.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated value 210 as the Object identifier for g9983MIB
   MODULE-IDENTITY <http://www.iana.org/> in the MIB-2 transmission
   sub-tree.
