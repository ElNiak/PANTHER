              Updating References to the IETF FTP Service

Abstract

   The IETF FTP service running at ftp.ietf.org, ops.ietf.org, and
   ietf.org will be retired.  A number of published RFCs in the IETF and
   IAB streams include URIs that reference this FTP service.  To ensure
   that the materials referenced using the IETF FTP service can still be
   found, this document updates the FTP-based references in these
   affected documents with HTTPS URIs.

1.  Introduction

   After community consultation in late 2020, it was decided to retire
   the IETF FTP service running at ftp.ietf.org, ops.ietf.org, and
   ietf.org [FTP-RETIREMENT].  Appendix B of [FTP-RETIREMENT-PLAN]
   identifies 30 RFCs published in the IETF and IAB streams between
   1997-2006 that have at least one explicit or inline reference to a
   URI pointing to the IETF FTP service.  To ensure that the materials
   referenced using the IETF FTP service can still be found, this
   document formally updates those RFCs that had not been updated by
   other documents with HTTPS URIs to the same materials.

   Section 3 enumerates each of the affected RFCs and provides
   replacement text.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The original text from an RFC to be updated will be quoted with
   "OLD", and the replacement text will be quoted with "NEW".

3.  Updated References

3.26.  Generic Guidance

   If any other RFC not explicitly mentioned in an earlier section
   contains a reference of the form "ftp://ftp.ietf.org/<path>", the
   reference MUST be replaced with a URI of the form
   "https://www.ietf.org/ietf-ftp/<path>".

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the security considerations of the
   updated documents.

   This document replaces URIs to the IETF infrastructure that use an
   FTP scheme with equivalent HTTPS scheme URIs.  These updates ensure
   the continued availability of content referenced in previously
   published RFCs when the IETF FTP service is retired.  Additionally,
   the replacement of the cleartext FTP with HTTPS will ensure that
   resources on the IETF infrastructure can be accessed in a more secure
   way.  For example, HTTPS provides an encrypted channel that includes
   protections, such as verifying the server's identity per the
   certificate verification behavior of the client and integrity and
   confidentiality protection commensurate with the negotiated TLS
   protocol version and ciphersuite.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
