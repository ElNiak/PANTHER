Abstract

   This document defines the expression of Whois++ protocol (RFC1835)
   responses within MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
   (RFC2046) media types.  The intention of this document, in
   conjunction with RFC 2957 is to enable MIME-enabled mail software,
   and other systems using Internet media types, to carry out Whois++
   transactions.

1.  MIME Registration Information

   To: iana@isi.edu Subject:  Registration of MIME media type

   MIME Type name:         Application

   Required parameters:    none

   Optional parameters:    none

   Encoding considerations: Any valid MIME encodings may be used

   Intended usage:         common

2.  whoispp-response Syntax

   The following grammar, which uses ABNF-like notation as defined in
   [RFC2234], defines a subset of responses expected from a Whois++
   server upon receipt of a valid Whois++ query.  As such, it describes
   the expected structure of a whoispp-response media type object.

   N.B.:  As outlined in the ABNF definition, rule names and string
   literals are in the US-ASCII character set, and are case-insensitive.
