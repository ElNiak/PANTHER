              Request to Move RFC 2754 to Historic Status

Abstract

   RFC 2754 requested that each time IANA made an address assignment, it
   was to create appropriate inetnum and as-block objects and digitally
   sign them.  The purpose was to distribute the IANA-held public key in
   software implementations of the Distributed Routing Policy System.
   In practice, this was never done on the public Internet.  This
   document requests that RFC 2754 be moved to Historic status.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) (www.iana.org) is
   charged with allocating parameter values for fields in protocols that
   have been designed, created, or are maintained by the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  RFC 2754 [RFC2754] requests that the
   IANA create a repository of Routing Policy Specification Language
   (RPSL) objects and digitally sign them.  The RFC identifies the
   initial objects to be signed and also requests that each time IANA
   makes an address assignment it also create new objects as needed and
   sign them as well.  In practice, this was never done in the public
   Internet.  During a detailed review of IANA's protocol registration
   activities in support of the IETF, this request for IANA action was
   identified as one of those that had not been completed after
   publication of the RFC.

   This document obsoletes RFC 2754 [RFC2754], recommends that it be
   moved to Historic status, and directs IANA not to move forward with
   the IANA actions in that RFC.

2.  Details

   RFC 2754 [RFC2754] requests that the IANA create a repository of RPSL
   objects and digitally sign them.  The RFC identifies the initial
   objects to be signed and also requests that each time IANA makes an
   address assignment it also create new objects as needed and sign them
   as well.

   During a review of RFCs in 2009, it became apparent that the IANA
   actions requested in RFC 2754 were never done.  In the intervening
   time, another technology appears to be taking the role once
   envisioned for Distributed RPSL.  Both an architecture and
   infrastructure now exist for secure routing using Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) technologies.  As an example, the semantics of
   a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) -- an application of the RPKI --
   to validate the origination of routes has been standardized by
   the IETF.

RFC 6254               RFC 2754 to Historic Status              May 2011


   Implementation of the IANA actions in RFC 2754 would now require
   significant implementation complexity.  In the face of alternative
   technology, and given that the requested actions have not been
   implemented in the public Internet, it is proposed to reclassify
   RFC 2754 [RFC2754] as Historic and to direct the IANA not to pursue
   or implement the IANA requests in that document.

3.  Terminology

   The word "allocation" designates a block of addresses managed by a
   registry for the purpose of making assignments and allocations.  The
   word "assignment" designates a block of addresses, or a single
   address, registered to an end-user for use on a specific network, or
   set of networks.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is instructed not to pursue or implement the IANA actions
   requested in RFC 2754 [RFC2754].

5.  Security Considerations

   The intended signature of inetnum and as-block objects never took
   place in the public Internet.  Moving RFC 2754 [RFC2754] to Historic
   status would have no known impact on the security of the Internet.
