   Deprecating MD5 and SHA-1 Signature Hashes in TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2

Abstract

   The MD5 and SHA-1 hashing algorithms are increasingly vulnerable to
   attack, and this document deprecates their use in TLS 1.2 and DTLS
   1.2 digital signatures.  However, this document does not deprecate
   SHA-1 with Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC), as used in
   record protection.  This document updates RFC 5246.

1.  Introduction

   The usage of MD5 and SHA-1 for signature hashing in (D)TLS 1.2 is
   specified in [RFC5246].  MD5 and SHA-1 have been proven to be
   insecure, subject to collision attacks [Wang].  In 2011, [RFC6151]
   detailed the security considerations, including collision attacks for
   MD5.  NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011
   [NISTSP800-131A-R2] and disallowed its use for digital signatures at
   the end of 2013, based on both the attack described in [Wang] and the
   potential for brute-force attack.  In 2016, researchers from the
   National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology
   (INRIA) identified a new class of transcript collision attacks on TLS
   (and other protocols) that relies on efficient collision-finding
   algorithms on the underlying hash constructions
   [Transcript-Collision].  Further, in 2017, researchers from Google
   and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) Amsterdam [SHA-1-Collision]
   proved SHA-1 collision attacks were practical.  This document updates
   [RFC5246] in such a way that MD5 and SHA-1 MUST NOT be used for
   digital signatures.  However, this document does not deprecate SHA-1
   with HMAC, as used in record protection.  Note that the CA/Browser
   Forum (CABF) has also deprecated use of SHA-1 for use in certificate
   signatures [CABF].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Signature Algorithms

   Clients MUST include the signature_algorithms extension.  Clients
   MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in this extension.

3.  Certificate Request

   Servers SHOULD NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in CertificateRequest
   messages.

4.  Server Key Exchange

   Servers MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in ServerKeyExchange messages.
   If the client receives a ServerKeyExchange message indicating MD5 or
   SHA-1, then it MUST abort the connection with an illegal_parameter
   alert.

5.  Certificate Verify

   Clients MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in CertificateVerify messages.
   If a server receives a CertificateVerify message with MD5 or SHA-1,
   it MUST abort the connection with an illegal_parameter alert.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated the "TLS SignatureScheme" registry by changing the
   recommended status of SHA-1-based signature schemes to "N" (not
   recommended), as defined by [RFC8447].  The following entries have
   been updated; other entries in the registry remain the same.

      +========+================+=============+=====================+
      | Value  |  Description   | Recommended |      Reference      |
      +========+================+=============+=====================+
      | 0x0201 | rsa_pkcs1_sha1 |      N      | [RFC8446] [RFC9155] |
      +--------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+
      | 0x0203 |   ecdsa_sha1   |      N      | [RFC8446] [RFC9155] |
      +--------+----------------+-------------+---------------------+

                                  Table 1

   IANA has also updated the reference for the "TLS SignatureAlgorithm"
   and "TLS HashAlgorithm" registries to refer to this document in
   addition to RFCs 5246 and 8447.

7.  Security Considerations

   Concerns with (D)TLS 1.2 implementations falling back to SHA-1 is an
   issue.  This document updates the TLS 1.2 specification [RFC5246] to
   deprecate support for MD5 and SHA-1 for digital signatures.  However,
   this document does not deprecate SHA-1 with HMAC, as used in record
   protection.
