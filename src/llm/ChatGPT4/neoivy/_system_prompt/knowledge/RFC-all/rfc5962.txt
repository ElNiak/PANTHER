       Dynamic Extensions to the Presence Information Data Format
                       Location Object (PIDF-LO)

Abstract

   The Geopriv Location Object introduced by the Presence Information
   Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO), RFC 4119, defines a basic
   XML format for carrying geographical information of a presentity.
   This document defines PIDF-LO extensions to convey information about
   moving objects.  Elements are defined that enable expression of
   spatial orientation, speed, and heading of the presentity.

1.  Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO) (see
   RFC 4119 [RFC4119]) provides geographical location of a presentity.
   This corresponds to a physical location at a given instance of time.
   RFC 5491 [RFC5491] extends PIDF-LO and provides additional guidelines
   to implementers.

   This document extends PIDF-LO to convey spatial orientation, speed,
   and heading of a presentity.  The addition of rate-of-change
   information to the PIDF-LO enables a range of use cases.  These use
   cases either use dynamic information directly or use that information







Schulzrinne, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 5962              Dynamic Extensions to PIDF-LO       September 2010


   for smoother tracking of a position over time.  For example, an
   application that continuously tracks a presentity could use velocity
   information to extrapolate positions in between times that location
   information is measured.  A shipping company could directly use speed
   to monitor delivery truck speed to ensure speed limits are observed.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

   This document uses the term "presentity", as defined in RFC 2778
   [RFC2778], to refer to the device subject to location determination.
   The similarity to presence concepts and the abstract location privacy
   architecture, as described in RFC 4079 [RFC4079], led to re-use of
   the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) (see RFC 3863 [RFC3863]),
   and its enhancement for location information (see RFC 4119
   [RFC4119]).  Note that this document does not differentiate between
   human and non-human objects, and hence both are in scope.

3.  Dynamic Elements

   This document defines a new element, <Dynamic>, for the conveyance of
   dynamic information.

   Dynamic information MAY be included without any other location
   information being present.  When dynamic information is associated
   with information about the instantaneous position of the presentity,
   the <Dynamic> element MUST be included in the same <location-info>
   element as the corresponding geodetic (or civic) location
   information.

   Dynamic information can be safely ignored by a recipient that does
   not support this specification.  The <Dynamic> element contains the
   following components:

   orientation:

      The <orientation> element describes the spatial orientation of the
      presentity -- the direction that the object is pointing.  For a
      device, this orientation might depend on the type of device.  See
      Section 3.1 for details.

   speed:

      Speed is the time rate of change in position of a presentity
      without regard for direction: the scalar component of velocity.
      The value for the <speed> element is a measure that is defined in
      meters per second.

   heading:

      Heading is the directional component of velocity.  See Section 3.1
      for details.

   Each element can be omitted if no information is available.  In the
   following example, the presentity is approximately oriented to the
   North at a slightly elevated angle.  The presentity is travelling
   24 meters per second to the West:

   Another example shows a PIDF-LO document of the presentity
   alice@example.com on a bike travelling 12 meters per second.  Her
   position is indicated as a circle.  The values for speed may be used
   by a receiver to adjust the uncertainty over time.

3.1.  Angular Measures and Coordinate Reference Systems

   [RFC5491] constrains the coordinate reference system (CRS) used in
   PIDF-LO to World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84), using either the two-
   dimensional (latitude, longitude) CRS identified by
   "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326" or the three-dimensional (latitude,
   longitude, altitude) CRS identified by "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4979".
   Dynamic locations similarly assume that either of these coordinate
   reference systems will be used.

   The <orientation> and <heading> elements both describe a direction.
   The <orientation> element describes the "direction of facing"; the
   <heading> element describes the "direction of travel".  Both measures



Schulzrinne, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 5962              Dynamic Extensions to PIDF-LO       September 2010


   contain one or two angular values that are expressed relative to the
   current position of the presentity (see Appendix A).  Angular
   measures are expressed in degrees, and values can be negative.  If
   two measures are present, the values MUST be separated by whitespace.

   The first measure specifies the horizontal direction from the current
   position of the presentity to a point that it is pointing towards
   (for <orientation>) or travelling towards (for <heading>).
   Horizontal angles are measured from Northing to Easting.  Horizontal
   angles start from zero when pointing to or travelling towards the
   North and increase towards the East.

   The second measure, if present, specifies the vertical component of
   this angle.  This angle is the elevation from the local horizontal
   plane.  If the second angle value is omitted, the vertical component
   is unknown.  If only one angle is present, <orientation> describes
   only the horizontal component.  For <heading>, the associated <speed>
   measure contains only the horizontal component of speed.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document defines additional location elements carried by
   PIDF-LO.  These additional elements provide greater reason to observe
   the privacy and security considerations described in RFC 4119
   [RFC4119].  No further privacy or security measures are necessary.

   RFC 4119 points back to RFC 3694 [RFC3694] and RFC 3693 [RFC3693] to
   describe the threat model and the security requirements imposed on
   the GEOPRIV architecture for sharing location information as a result
   of the threat model.  It is important to note that these two
   documents often refer to threats related to the current location
   information of a presentity, while this document introduces dynamic
   information that may be used by attackers to anticipate the future
   location of a presentity.  While already a series of location
   snapshots is likely to offer information for guessing the future
   location of a presentity, it has to be said that including more
   information in a PIDF-LO does increase the severity of an information
   leak.  Those who deploy location-based services are in general
   strongly advised to provide their users with ways to control the
   distribution of location information to those who have been
   authorized to see it.

6.  IANA Considerations

   [RFC3688]) and a new XML schema.

Appendix A.  Earth Centered, Earth Fixed Direction Vectors

   The absolute orientation or heading of a presentity depends on its
   latitude and longitude.  The following vectors can be used to
   determine the absolute direction in the WGS 84 Earth Centered, Earth
   Fixed (X, Y, Z) coordinate space.

   The direction of North as a unit vector in Earth Centered, Earth
   Fixed (ECEF) coordinates is:

      North = [ -1 * sin(latitude) * cos(longitude),
                -1 * sin(latitude) * sin(longitude),
                cos(latitude) ]

   The direction of "up" (the upward normal of the horizontal plane) as
   a unit vector in ECEF coordinates is:

      Up = [ cos(latitude) * cos(longitude),
             cos(latitude) * sin(longitude),
             sin(latitude) ]
