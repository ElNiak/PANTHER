                      The Unicode Code Points and
  Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) - Unicode 6.0

Abstract

   This memo documents IETF consensus for Internationalized Domain Names
   for Applications (IDNA) derived character properties related to the
   three code points, existing in Unicode 5.2, that changed property
   values when version 6.0 was released.  The consensus is that no
   update is needed to RFC 5892 based on the changes made in Unicode
   6.0.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5892 [RFC5892] specifies an algorithm that was defined when
   version 5.0 (later updated to version 5.2) [Unicode5.2] was the
   current version of Unicode, and it also defines a derived property
   value based on that algorithm.  Unicode 6.0 [Unicode6] has changed
   GeneralCategory of three code points that were allocated in
   Unicode 5.2 or earlier.  This implies that the derived property value
   differs depending on whether the property definitions used are from
   Unicode 5.2 or 6.0.  These are non-backward-compatible changes as
   described in Section 5.1 of RFC 5892.

   The three code points are:

1.1.  U+0CF1 KANNADA SIGN JIHVAMULIYA

   The GeneralCategory for this character changes from So to Lo.  This
   implies that the derived property value changes from DISALLOWED to
   PVALID.

1.2.  U+0CF2 KANNADA SIGN UPADHMANIYA

   The GeneralCategory for this character changes from So to Lo.  This
   implies that the derived property value changes from DISALLOWED to
   PVALID.

1.3.  U+19DA NEW TAI LUE THAM DIGIT ONE

   The GeneralCategory for this character changes from Nd to No.  This
   implies that the derived property value changes from PVALID to
   DISALLOWED.

2.  IETF Consensus

   No change to RFC 5892 is needed based on the changes made in
   Unicode 6.0.

RFC 6452                    IDNA Code Points               November 2011


   This consensus does not imply that no changes will be made to
   RFC 5892 for all future updates of The Unicode Standard.

   This RFC has been produced because 6.0 is the first version of
   Unicode to be released since IDNA2008 was published.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated the derived property value registry according to
   RFC 5892 and the property values defined in The Unicode Standard
   version 6.0.

4.  Security Considerations

   When the algorithm presented in RFC 5892 is applied using the
   property definitions of Unicode Standard version 6.0, the result will
   be different from when it is applied using the property definitions
   of Unicode 5.2 for the three code points discussed in this document.
   The three code points are unlikely to occur in internationalized
   domain names, however, so the security implications of the changes
   are minor.
