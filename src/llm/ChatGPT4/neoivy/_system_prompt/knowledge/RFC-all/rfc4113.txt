RFC 4113                        UDP MIB                        June 2005


1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for implementations
   of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), as defined in RFC 768 [RFC0768],
   in an IP version independent manner.

   The current UDP-MIB defined in this memo consists of one table and a
   group of scalars:

   o  The udp group of scalars reports parameters and statistics of a
      UDP protocol engine.  Two scalars, udpHCInDatagrams and
      udpHCOutDatagrams, have been added to this group since the
      publication of RFC 2013 [RFC2013] in order to provide high-
      capacity counters for fast networks.  Discontinuities in the
      values of the counters in this group are indicated by
      discontinuities in the value of the sysUpTime object, which is
      defined in RFC 3418 [RFC3418].

   o  The udpEndpointTable provides access to status information for all
      UDP endpoints handled by a UDP protocol engine.  The table
      provides for strictly listening endpoints, as with the historical
      udpTable, and also for "connected" UDP endpoints, which only
      accept packets from a given remote system.  It also reports
      identification of the operating system level processes that handle
      UDP connections.  Addresses and ports of UDP endpoints in this
      table are represented using the InetAddressType, InetAddress, and
      InetPortNumber textual conventions defined in RFC 4001 [RFC4001].

RFC 4113                        UDP MIB                        June 2005


2.1.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section discusses the relationship of this UDP-MIB module to
   other MIB modules.

2.1.1.  Relationship to RFC1213-MIB

   UDP related MIB objects were originally defined as part of the
   RFC1213-MIB, defined in RFC 1213 [RFC1213].  The UDP related objects
   of the RFC1213-MIB were later copied into a separate MIB module and
   published in RFC 2013 [RFC2013] in SMIv2 format.

   The previous versions of the UDP-MIB both defined the udpTable, which
   has been deprecated for basically two reasons:

   (1) The udpTable only supports IPv4.

       The current approach in the IETF is to write IP version neutral
       MIBs rather than have different definitions for various version
       of IP.  This reduces the amount of overhead when new objects are
       introduced, since there is only one place to add them.  Hence,
       the approach taken in RFC 2454 [RFC2454] of having separate
       tables is not continued.

   (2) The udpTable does not permit describing "connected" UDP
       endpoints.

       It turns out that "connected" endpoints tend to have a different
       behaviour and management access pattern from those of listening
       endpoints.  Adding remote endpoint information to the
       udpEndpointTable thus allows for the addition of specific status
       and statistic objects for "connected" endpoints and connections.

2.1.2.  Relationship to the IPV6-UDP-MIB

   The IPV6-UDP-MIB, defined in RFC 2454 [RFC2454], has been moved to
   Historic because the approach of having separate IP version specific
   tables is not followed anymore.  Implementation of RFC 2454 is thus
   not suggested anymore.

   Note that because scoped addresses are now represented using the
   IPv4z and IPv6z address types, there is no longer a need to
   explicitly include the ifIndex in the index clause of the
   udpEndpointTable.  This is a change from the use of ipv6UdpIfIndex in
   RFC 2454.

2.1.3.  Relationship to HOST-RESOURCES-MIB and SYSAPPL-MIB

   The udpEndpointTable reports the identification of the operating
   system level process that handles a connection or a listening
   endpoint.  The value is reported as an Unsigned32, which is expected
   to be the same as the hrSWRunIndex of the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
   [RFC2790] (if the value is smaller than 2147483647) or the
   sysApplElmtRunIndex of the SYSAPPL-MIB [RFC2287].  This allows
   management applications to identify the UDP connections that belong
   to an operating system level process, which has proven valuable in
   operational environments.

                 groups representing the current set of objects.
               - Deprecated udpMIBCompliance and replaced it with
                 udpMIBCompliance2, which includes the compliance
                 information for the new object groups.

               The address type in this table represents the address
               type used for the communication, irrespective of the
               higher-layer abstraction.  For example, an application
               using IPv6 'sockets' to communicate via IPv4 between
               ::ffff:10.0.0.1 and ::ffff:10.0.0.2 would use
               InetAddressType ipv4(1).

               Unlike the udpTable in RFC 2013, this table also allows
               the representation of an application that completely
               specifies both local and remote addresses and ports.  A
               listening application is represented in three possible
               ways:

               1) An application that is willing to accept both IPv4
                  and IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
                  udpEndpointLocalAddressType of unknown(0) and a
                  udpEndpointLocalAddress of ''h (a zero-length
                  octet-string).

               2) An application that is willing to accept only IPv4
                  or only IPv6 datagrams is represented by a
                  udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
                  address type and a udpEndpointLocalAddress of
                  '0.0.0.0' or '::' respectively.

               3) An application that is listening for datagrams only
                  for a specific IP address but from any remote
                  system is represented by a
                  udpEndpointLocalAddressType of the appropriate
                  address type, with udpEndpointLocalAddress
                  specifying the local address.

               In all cases where the remote is a wildcard, the
               udpEndpointRemoteAddressType is unknown(0), the
               udpEndpointRemoteAddress is ''h (a zero-length
               octet-string), and the udpEndpointRemotePort is 0.

               If the operating system is demultiplexing UDP packets
               by remote address and port, or if the application has
               'connected' the socket specifying a default remote
               address and port, the udpEndpointRemote* values should
               be used to reflect this."

   Juergen Schoenwalder provided much of the text for section 2.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB that have a MAX-
   ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this MIB is
   implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an intruder can
   alter or create any management objects of this MIB module via direct
   SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The indices of the udpEndpointTable and udpTable contain information
   on the listeners on an entity.  In particular, the
   udpEndpointLocalPort and udpLocalPort objects in the indices can be
   used to identify what ports are open on the machine and what attacks
   are likely to succeed, without the attacker having to run a port
   scanner.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.




Fenner & Flick                 Standards                       [Page 16]

RFC 4113                        UDP MIB                        June 2005


   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Furthermore, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values, recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         +------------+-------------------------+
         | Descriptor | OBJECT IDENTIFIER value |
         +------------+-------------------------+
         | udp        | { mib-2 7}              |
         | udpMIB     | { mib-2 50 }            |
