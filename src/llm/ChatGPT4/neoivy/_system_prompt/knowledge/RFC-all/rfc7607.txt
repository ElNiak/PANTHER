                    Codification of AS 0 Processing

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 4271 and proscribes the use of Autonomous
   System (AS) 0 in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) OPEN, AS_PATH,
   AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR, and AS4_AGGREGATOR attributes in the BGP UPDATE
   message.

1.  Introduction

   Autonomous System 0 was listed in the IANA Autonomous System Number
   Registry as "Reserved - May be use [sic] to identify non-routed
   networks" ([IANA.AS_Numbers]).

   [RFC6491] specifies that AS 0 in a Route Origin Attestation (ROA) is
   used to mark a prefix and all its more specific prefixes as not to be
   used in a routing context.  This allows a resource holder to signal
   that a prefix (and the more specifics) should not be routed by
   publishing a ROA listing AS 0 as the only origin.  To respond to this
   signal requires that BGP implementations not accept or propagate
   routes containing AS 0.

   No clear statement that AS 0 was proscribed could be found in any BGP
   specification.  This document corrects this omission, most
   importantly in the case of the AS_PATH.  This represents an update to
   the error handling procedures given in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of
   [RFC4271] by specifying the behavior in the presence of AS 0.

   At least two implementations discard routes containing AS 0, and this
   document codifies this behavior.

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Behavior

   A BGP speaker MUST NOT originate or propagate a route with an AS
   number of zero in the AS_PATH, AS4_PATH, AGGREGATOR, or
   AS4_AGGREGATOR attributes.

   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS_PATH
   or AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed and be
   handled by the procedures specified in [RFC7606].

   An UPDATE message that contains the AS number of zero in the AS4_PATH
   or AS4_AGGREGATOR attribute MUST be considered as malformed and be
   handled by the procedures specified in [RFC6793].

   If a BGP speaker receives zero as the peer AS in an OPEN message, it
   MUST abort the connection and send a NOTIFICATION with Error Code
   "OPEN Message Error" and subcode "Bad Peer AS" (see Section 6 of
   [RFC4271]).  A router MUST NOT initiate a connection claiming to be
   AS 0.

   Authors of future protocol extensions that carry the Autonomous
   System number are encouraged to keep in mind that AS 0 is reserved
   and to provide clear direction on how to handle AS 0.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has updated the registry for "16-bit Autonomous System
   Numbers" so that the entry for AS 0 is simply "Reserved".

4.  Security Considerations

   By allowing a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) resource
   holder to issue a ROA saying that AS 0 is the only valid origin for a
   route, we allow them to state that a particular address resource is
   not in use.  By ensuring that all implementations that see AS 0 in a
   route ignore that route, we prevent a malicious party from announcing
   routes containing AS 0 in an attempt to hijack those resources.

   In addition, by standardizing the behavior upon reception of an
   AS_PATH (or AS4_PATH) containing AS 0, this document makes the
   behavior better defined.
