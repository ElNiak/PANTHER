IESG NOTE

   This memo describes a simple method of encoding PSTN addresses of
   facsimile devices in the local-part of Internet email addresses.

   As with all Internet mail addresses, the left-hand-side (local- part)
   of an address generated according to this specification, is not to be
   interpreted except by the MTA that is named on the right-hand-side
   (domain).

1. Introduction

   Since the very first e-mail to fax gateway objects appeared, a number
   of different methods to specify a fax address as an e-mail address
   have been used by implementors. Two major objectives for this were

     - enable an e-mail user to send faxes from his/her e-mail
       interface;

     - enable some kind of "fax over e-mail service" transport, to
       reduce the costs of fax transmissions, and use the existing
       e-mail infrastructure.

RFC 2304               Minimal FAX address format             March 1998


   This memo describes the MINIMAL addressing method and standard
   extensions to encode FAX addresses in e-mail addresses, as required
   in reference [13]. The opposite problem, i.e. to allow a traditional
   numeric-only fax device user to access the e-mail transport service,
   is not discussed here.

   All implementations supporting this FAX over e-mail address format
   MUST support as a minimum the specification described in this
   document.  The generic complex case of converting the whole PSTN
   addressing in e-mail is out of scope in this minimal specification:
   there is some work in progress in the field, where also a number of
   standard optional extensions are being defined.

   In this document the formal definitions are described using ABNF
   syntax, as defined into [7]. We will also use some of the "CORE
   DEFINITIONS" defined in "APPENDIX A - CORE" of that document. The
   exact meaning of the capitalised words

      "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
      "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", "OPTIONAL"

   is defined in reference [6].

2. Minimal Fax address

   The "service-selector" defined in section 2 of reference [13] for the
   fax service is:

      service-selector = "FAX"

   The minimal addressing for the fax service also requires support for
   a "qualif-type1" element (see section 2 of reference [13]).  This
   element is an OPTIONAL element of the fax address, but its support,
   when present, is REQUIRED:

      qualif-type1 = "/" t33-sep "=" sub-addr

   where

      t33-sep = "T33S"

      sub-addr = 1*( DIGIT )

   Thus, the minimal specification of a fax in e-mail address is:

      fax-address = fax-mbox [ "/T33S=" sub-addr ]

      fax-mbox = "FAX=" global-phone

RFC 2304               Minimal FAX address format             March 1998


   Note:
     See section 4.1 in case multiple sub-addr per fax-mbox need to be
     specified.

   The Minimal supported syntax for global-phone (as described in
   section reference [13]) is:


   global-phone = "+" 1*( DIGIT , written-sep )

   written-sep = ( "-" / "." )

   The use of other dialling schemas for PSTN numbers (like private
   numbering plans or local dialling conventions) is also allowed.
   However, this does not preclude nor remove the minimal compulsory
   requirement to support the "global-phone" syntax as defined above.

   Any non "global-phone" dialling schema MUST NOT use the leading "+"
   between the "=" sign and the dialling string. The "+" sign is
   strictly reserved for the standard "global-phone" syntax.

   Note:
     The specification of these different dialling schemas is out of
     scope for this minimal specification.

   User specification of PSTN e-mail addresses will be facilitated if
   they can insert these separators between dial elements like digits
   etc.  For this reason we allow them in the syntax the written-sep
   element.

   Implementors' note:
     Use of the written-sep elements is allowed, but not recommended.
     Any occurences of written-sep elements in a pstn-mbox MUST be
     ignored by all conformant implementations. User Agents SHOULD
     remove written-sep elements before submitting messages to the
     Message Transport System.

2.2 Some examples of a minimal "fax-address"

      FAX=+3940226338

      FAX=+12027653000/T33S=1387

      FAX=+33-1-88335215

3. The e-mail address of the I-fax device: mta-I-fax

   An "I-fax device" has an e-mail address, or to be more exact, a name
   which enables a mail system to identify it on the e-mail global
   system.

   In Internet mail, this is the Right Hand Side (RHS) part of the
   address, i.e. the part on the right of the "@" sign. We will call
   this mta-I-fax

      mta-I-fax = domain

   For "domain" strings used in SMTP transmissions, the string MUST
   conform to the requirements of that standard's <domain>
   specifications [1], [3].  For "domain" strings used in message
   content headers, the string MUST conform to the requirements of the
   relevant standards [2], [3].

   Note: in both cases, the standards permit use of "domain names" or
         "domain literals" in addresses.


4. The fax-email

   The complete structure used to transfer a minimal FAX address over
   the Internet e-mail transport system is called "fax-email". This
   object is an e-mail address which conforms to RFC822 [2] and RFC1123
   [3] "addr-spec" syntax, with some extra structure which allows the
   FAX number to be identified.

         fax-email =  ["/"] fax-address ["/"] "@" mta-I-fax

   Implementors' note:
     The optional "/" characters can result from other mail transport
     services gateways, where it is also an optional element.
     Implementations MUST accept the optional slashes but SHOULD NOT
     generate them. Gateways are allowed to strip them off when
     converting to Internet mail addressing.

     It is essential to remind that "fax-address" element MUST strictly
     follow the "quoting rules" spcified in the relevant standards [2],
     [3]

4.1 Multiple subaddresses

   In case a particular service requires multiple T.33 subaddresses, and
   these subaddresses need to be given on the same "fax-mbox", multiple
   "fax-email" elements will be used.

RFC 2304               Minimal FAX address format             March 1998


   Implementors' note:
     The UA could accept multiple subaddress elements for the same
     global-phone, but it must generate multiple "fax-mbox" elements
     when passing the message to the MTA.

4.2 Some examples of minimal "fax-email"

      FAX=+3940226338@faxworld.org

      FAX=+12027653000/T33S=1387@faxworld.org

      /FAX=+33-1-88335215/@faxworld.org

5. Conclusion

   This proposal creates a minimal standard encoding for FAX addresses
   within the global e-mail transport system. The proposal requires no
   changes to existing e-mail software.

6. Security Considerations

   This document specifies a means by which FAX addresses can be encoded
   into e-mail addresses. As routing of e-mail messages is determined by
   Domain Name System (DNS) information, a successful attack on this
   service could force the mail path via some particular gateway or
   message transfer agent where mail security can be affected by
   compromised software.

   There are several means by which an attacker might be able to deliver
   incorrect mail routing information to a client. These include: (a)
   compromise of a DNS server, (b) generating a counterfeit response to
   a client's DNS query, (c) returning incorrect "additional
   information" in response to an unrelated query. Clients SHOULD ensure
   that mail routing is based only on authoritative answers. Once DNS
   Security mechanisms [5] become more widely deployed, clients SHOULD
   employ those mechanisms to verify the authenticity and integrity of
   mail routing records.
