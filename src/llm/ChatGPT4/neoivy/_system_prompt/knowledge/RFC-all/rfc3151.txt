Abstract

   This document describes a URN (Uniform Resource Name) namespace that
   is designed to allow Public Identifiers to be expressed in URI
   (Uniform Resource Identifiers) syntax.

1. Introduction

   XML [1] external entities have two identifiers: a system identifier
   and a public identifier.  The system identifier is a URI, by
   definition, but the public identifier is simply a string.

   Historically, the system identifier of an external entity has been a
   local, or system-specific identifier while the public identifier has
   been a more global, persistent name.

   Unfortunately, public identifiers do not fit neatly into the existing
   web architecture because they are not legal URIs.  Many new
   specifications (XSLT, XML Schema, etc.) have the implicit or explicit
   requirement that all external identifiers be URIs.

   The purpose of this namespace is to allow public identifiers to be
   encoded in URNs in a reliable, comparable way.

RFC 3151         A URN Namespace for Public Identifiers      August 2001


   This document describes a scheme for representing public identifiers
   as URNs by introducing a public identifier namespace, "publicid".

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace.

1.1 Public Identifiers

   Any string which consists only of the public identifier characters
   (defined by Production 13 of Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0
   Second Edition [1]) is a legal public identifier.

   In addition to the character set restriction, public identifiers must
   be normalized by changing all strings of whitespace (the characters
   #x20, #x9, #xD, and #xA) to single space characters (#x20), and
   removing all leading and trailing whitespace.

   In keeping with this specification's goal of allowing public
   identifiers to be encoded in a reliable, comparable way, this
   specification mandates that public identifiers be normalized before
   encoding them into URNs.  Throughout this specification, we assume
   that normalization has already been performed.

1.2 Formal Public Identifiers

   SGML [2] defines a restricted subset of public identifier called a
   "Formal Public Identifier" (FPI).

   FPIs are strings composed from the same range of characters as public
   identifiers, but with an explicit internal structure.  The structure
   of Formal Public Identifiers is normatively described in SGML [2]; we
   review it here for convenience.

   Most Formal Public Identifiers consist of the following fields, in
   this order: an owner identifier, a public text class, a public text
   description, a public text language or public text designating
   sequence, and an optional public text display version.

   Owner identifiers may begin with "-//" or "+//"; otherwise "//" is
   used to delimit fields in the FPI (with the exception of the public
   text class which is delimited from the public text description by a
   space).

   In other words, most FPIs look like this:

      owner//class description//language//version

   and most owners begin with "+//" or "-//", although they are not
   required to.  Here are some example FPIs:

   This document describes an algorithm for encoding public identifiers
   into URNs that explicitly allows the structured nature of formal
   public identifiers to be preserved.  However, an algorithm for
   correctly identifying a Formal Public Identifier and determining the
   various fields within it is out of scope for this document and not
   necessary for the implementation of this URN namespace.

   Declaration of structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) for URNs in the "publicid"
      namespace has the following structure:

         urn:publicid:{transcribed-public-identifier}

      Where:

            {transcribed-public-identifier} is the text of the public
            identifier transcribed according to the following rules:






Walsh, et al.                Informational                      [Page 3]

RFC 3151         A URN Namespace for Public Identifiers      August 2001


               -  A space in the public identifier is transcribed as
                  "+".  Whitespace normalization must be performed
                  before constructing a URN in the "publicid" namespace,
                  therefore adjacent "+" characters never occur in URNs
                  in this namespace.
               -  The sequence of characters "//" is transcribed as ":".
               -  The sequence of characters "::" is transcribed as ";".
               -  A literal "+" character is transcribed as "%2B".
               -  A literal ":" character (except in "::") is
                  transcribed as "%3A".
               -  A literal "/" character (except in "//") is
                  transcribed as "%2F".
               -  A literal ";" character is transcribed as "%3B".
               -  A literal "'" character is transcribed as "%27".
               -  A literal "?" character is transcribed as "%3F".
               -  A literal "#" character is transcribed as "%23".
               -  A literal "%" character is transcribed as "%25".

   The special rules for "//" and "::" are designed to preserve the
   structured nature of formal public identifiers without requiring the
   translator to have special knowledge of FPI syntax.

   The rules for "+", ":", "/", and ";" are required to preserve literal
   occurrences of these characters in the 'publicid' URN namespace.

   The remaining characters, " " (space), "'", "?", "#", and "%", are
   the only other legal characters in public identifiers that cannot be
   literally transcribed into a URN by the rules of RFC 2141 [4] and RFC
   2396 [5].

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The identifier uniqueness considerations for URNs in the
      "publicid" namespace are the same as the identifier uniqueness
      considerations for public identifiers.  Formal Public Identifiers
      with registered owner identifiers are required to be unique.  For
      unregistered owner identifiers and informal public identifiers,
      they may or may not be unique.  No enforcement policy can be
      asserted.

RFC 3151         A URN Namespace for Public Identifiers      August 2001


   Identifier persistence considerations:

      The persistence of URNs in the "publicid" namespace is the same as
      the persistence of the corresponding public identifier.

      The "publicid" namespace is available for a wide range of uses; it
      cannot be subjected to a uniform persistence policy.  As a general
      rule, formal public identifiers with registered owner identifiers
      are more likely to be persistent than informal public identifiers
      or formal public identifiers with unregistered owner identifiers.

      One exception to this rule is the "IDN" scheme for producing a
      registered owner identifier from a domain name.  That scheme
      contains at least all the weaknesses associated with the
      persistence of domain names.

      It is important to note that a properly registered owner
      identifier can apply any policy desired to the portion of the
      "publicid" URN namespace identified by that owner identifier.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Identifiers in the "publicid" namespace are assigned by applying
      the conversions described above to a public identifier.  In order
      to provide a URN in this namespace for a resource that does not
      have a public identifier, one must be created (according to the
      rules for creating public identifiers).

      There is no requirement that a resource have only one public
      identifier.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      Identifiers in the "publicid" namespace may be resolved by the
      same policies and procedures as public identifiers.  Public
      identifiers can be resolved in many different ways.  Many existing
      systems provide facilities for resolving them by way of OASIS
      TR9401 [6] Catalog files.  Other systems resolve them by mapping
      each component to a local pathname component.  And some systems
      simply "know about" a fixed set of public identifiers.  In
      addition, URNs in the 'publicid' namespace may be resolvable by
      other mechanisms unique to URIs (such as caches).

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      Whitespace normalization is performed before constructing a URN in
      the "publicid" namespace, so URNs are lexically equivalent if and
      only if they are lexically identical.

RFC 3151         A URN Namespace for Public Identifiers      August 2001


   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.  URNs in this namespace conform to both
      RFC 2141 and RFC 2396.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.

   Scope:

      Global

      "urn:publicid:%2B:IDN+example.org:DTD+XML+Bookmarks+1.0:EN:XML"

      "-//ArborText::prod//DTD Help Document::19970708//EN" becomes
      "urn:publicid:-:ArborText;prod:DTD+Help+Document;19970708:EN"

      "foo" becomes
      "urn:publicid:foo"

      "3+3=6" becomes
      "urn:publicid:3%2B3=6"

      "-//Acme, Inc.//DTD Book Version 1.0" becomes
      "urn:publicid:-:Acme,+Inc.:DTD+Book+Version+1.0"

4. Security Considerations

      There are no additional security considerations other than those
      normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in
      general.
