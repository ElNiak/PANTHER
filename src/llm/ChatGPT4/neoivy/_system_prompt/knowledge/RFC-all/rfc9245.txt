                      IETF Discussion List Charter

Abstract

   The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) discussion mailing list
   furthers the development and specification of Internet technology
   through the general discussion of technical, procedural, operational,
   and other topics for which no dedicated mailing lists exist.  As this
   is the most general IETF mailing list, considerable latitude in terms
   of topics is allowed, but there are posts and topics that are
   unsuitable for this mailing list.  This document defines the charter
   for the IETF discussion list and explains its scope.

   This document obsoletes RFC 3005 and updates RFC 3683.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF discussion list [IETF-DISCUSS] furthers the development and
   specification of Internet technology through the general discussion
   of technical, procedural, operational, and other topics for which no
   dedicated mailing lists exist.  As this is the most general IETF
   mailing list, considerable latitude in terms of topics is allowed.
   However, there are posts and topics that are unsuitable for this
   mailing list.  This document defines the charter for the IETF
   discussion list and explains its scope.

   The IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL] applies to discussions on the IETF
   discussion list and all other IETF mailing lists, and requires
   conformance with the IETF Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the
   Anti-Harassment Policy [RFC7776], among others.

   This document obsoletes [RFC3005], as it documents the use of other
   mailing lists for discussions that were previously in scope for the
   IETF discussion list, refers to applicable policies such as the
   Guidelines for Conduct [RFC7154] and the Anti-Harassment Policy
   [RFC7776], and clarifies moderation procedures.  It also updates part
   of Section 1 of [RFC3683], which copies the list of "inappropriate
   postings" from [RFC3005].  The list in [RFC3683] is hence updated by
   the new list in Section 2.

2.  Charter for the IETF Discussion List

   The IETF discussion list is meant for discussions for which a more
   appropriate list does not exist, such as discussions that do not fall
   within the scope of any working group, area, or other established
   list.  When there is an existing venue for discussion, this should be
   noted and discussion should be moved there.

   When no dedicated mailing list exists for a topic, it may be
   preferable to request that one be created [NON-WG-LISTS] rather than
   discuss it on the IETF discussion list.  Availability of the new list
   may be announced on the IETF discussion list and on other related
   lists, such as area lists.

   Appropriate postings to the IETF discussion list include:

   *  Initial discussion of technical issues that are candidates for
      IETF work, but appropriate mailing lists have not yet been
      identified.

   *  Questions and clarifications concerning practical aspects of IETF
      meetings, although most of these topics are better brought up on
      the discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS] or the attendee discussion list for a given IETF
      meeting.

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are
      sponsored or endorsed by the IETF, IRTF, IAB or the Internet
      Society, although the IETF announcement list [IETF-ANNOUNCE] is
      the preferred list for these.

   *  Discussions of IETF direction, policy, and the standards process
      in general, when a more suitable list (such as the discussion list
      for IETF LLC administrative issues [ADMIN-DISCUSS], the IAB
      discussion list for architectural issues [ARCH-DISCUSS], a meeting
      attendees list, a process-oriented WG list, etc.) cannot be
      identified.

   These topics used to be in scope for the IETF discussion list, but
   have since moved to dedicated lists:

   *  Last Call discussions of documents now take place on the IETF Last
      Calls mailing list [LAST-CALLS].

   *  Discussion of IETF administrative policies now takes place on the
      discussion list for IETF LLC administrative issues
      [ADMIN-DISCUSS].

   Inappropriate postings include:

   *  Advertising and other unsolicited bulk e-mail

   *  Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical topics

   *  Uncivil commentary, regardless of the general subject, per the
      IETF Note Well [NOTE-WELL]

   *  Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the IETF, IRTF, IAB, or the Internet
      Society.

3.  Moderation

   The IETF Chair appoints _Moderators_ (previously known as the
   "sergeant-at-arms") for the IETF discussion list that are empowered
   to restrict posting by a person, or to an email thread, when the
   content is inappropriate and represents a pattern of abuse.  They are
   encouraged to take into account the overall nature of the postings by
   an individual and whether particular postings are typical or an
   aberration.

   Moderation of the IETF discussion list, including the handling of any
   appeals, is guided by the IETF discussion list charter specified in
   Section 2, and the related guidance from Section 1 that applies to
   all mailing lists.  The moderators are selected from within the
   community to moderate the community.  Because the IESG and IAB are in
   the appeals chain for moderator decisions (see below), the IETF Chair
   therefore should not appoint a moderator who is serving in such a
   role.  If a moderator is selected for the IESG or IAB, they will step
   down from the moderator team.

   Apart from appointing moderators, the IETF Chair should refrain from
   the day-to-day operation and management of the moderator team.  The
   moderator team will independently define, publish, and execute their
   role; see the current set of operating procedures [MOD-SOP] and abuse
   patterns [MOD-UPC].  The moderator team should reach out to the IETF
   Chair for any conflict resolution in a timely manner.

   Because a moderator serves at the discretion of the IETF Chair --
   even if the IETF Chair is not otherwise involved in the operation of
   the moderator team -- any moderator decision can be appealed to the
   IETF Chair, per [RFC2026].  Decisions by the IETF Chair can be
   appealed to the IESG as whole, again per [RFC2026].

4.  Security Considerations

   The usual security considerations [RFC3552] do not apply to this
   document.

   Potential abuse of the moderation process for the suppression of
   undesired opinions is counteracted by the availability of an appeals
   process, per Section 3.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not request any IANA actions.
