           July, 1975, Survey of New-Protocol TELNET Servers


In the nearly five months since the last report several new server sites
have joined the network and there has been some significant progress in
New-Protocol implementation.  Perhaps the New-Protocol implementation on
the TIPs scheduled for the end of the year will encourage further
progress in the near future.

There have been numerous changes since the last list (numbers in octal):

SRI-ARC (2) is no longer a server host;
MIT-AI (206), MIT-ML (306), LONDON (52), and OFFICE-1 (53) have added
    New-Protocol servers;
LLL-RISOS (25), SDAC-44 (32), and ARPA-DMS (34) have joined the network;
SCI-TENEX (55), Rutgers-10 (56), USC-ISIC (364), and SUMEX-AIM (70) have
    joined the network with New-Protocol servers.

The following is the latest version* of the summary and tabulation of
server-host TELNET servers.
        total server hosts             43      100%
        no New-Prot server             16       37%
        unknown status (new host)       2        5%
        total New-Prot implem.         25       58%
            New-Prot on 1 and 27,
                Old on socket 1 (2)    13       30%
            New-Prot on 1 and 27 (3)    8       19%
            New-Prot on 1 only (3)      4        9%

Notes:

*  All data in this report were gathered via a surveying program run at
    various times, plus a few manual checks to fill out the list.  What
    is reported here is the way the various servers work as seen by the
    new-Protocol User Telnet at BBNA, as of 10 July 1975.

(2) These are the sites whose operation is 100% correct according to all
    protocols and conventions, as I understand them.

(3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New-Protocol
    servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt to
    communicate with both Old- and New-Protocol User TELNETs according
    to what control sequences are received.
