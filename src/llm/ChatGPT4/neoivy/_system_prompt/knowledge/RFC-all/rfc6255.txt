       Delay-Tolerant Networking Bundle Protocol IANA Registries

Abstract

   The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) Research Group research group has
   defined many protocols such as the Bundle Protocol and Licklider
   Transmission Protocol.  The specifications of these protocols contain
   fields that are subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its
   research work, the group created ad hoc registries.  As the
   specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable
   implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to
   IANA for official custody.  This document describes the actions
   executed by IANA.

1.  Introduction

   The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols relevant to the
   DTN architecture [RFC4838] such as the Bundle Protocol [RFC5050] and
   Licklider Transmission Protocol [RFC5326].  The specifications of
   these protocols contain fields that are subject to a registry.  For
   the purpose of its research work, the group created ad hoc registries
   (http://www.dtnrg.org/wiki/AssignedNamesAndNumbers).  As the
   specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable
   implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to
   IANA for official custody.  This document describes the actions
   executed by IANA.

2.  Treatment of Flag Fields Encoded Using SDNVs

   The DTN protocols use several extensible bit flag fields that are
   encoded as Self-Delimiting Numeric Values (SDNVs) as defined in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC5050].  For these fields, the registry specifies
   the allocation and usage of bit positions within the unencoded field.
   The SDNV encoding treats the ensemble of bits in the unencoded value
   as a numeric value to be encoded on transmission and decoded on
   reception as described in [RFC5050].

   Processing of SDNV-encoded flags is discussed in [RFC6256].

   Section 4.1 of [RFC5050] specifies that implementations are not
   required to handle SDNVs with more than 64 bits in their unencoded
   value.  Accordingly, SDNV-encoded flag fields should be limited to 64
   bit positions.

RFC 6255                   DTN IANA Registries                  May 2011


   IANA registry policies and wording used in this document are
   described in [RFC5226].

3.  Bundle Protocol

   The Bundle Protocol (BP) [RFC5050] has fields requiring a registry
   managed by IANA.

3.1.  Bundle Block Types

   The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Block Type code field (Section
   4.5.2) [RFC5050].  An IANA registry has been set up as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

      0-191: Specification Required

      192-255: Private or experimental use.  No assignment by IANA.

   The Value range is: unsigned 8-bit integer.

                        Bundle Block Type Registry

    +--------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    |        Value | Description                     | Reference     |
    +--------------+---------------------------------+---------------+
    |            0 | Reserved                        | This document |
    |            1 | Bundle Payload Block            | [RFC5050]     |
    |        2-191 | Unassigned                      |               |
    |      192-255 | Private and/or Experimental Use | [RFC5050]     |
    +--------------+---------------------------------+---------------+

   The value "0" was not defined in any document or in the ad hoc
   registry.  As per consensus by the DTNRG research group, it is
   reserved per this document.

3.2.  Primary Bundle Protocol Version

   The Bundle Protocol has a version field (see Section 4.5.1 of
   [RFC5050]).  An IANA registry has been set up as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is: RFC Required

   The Value range is: unsigned 8-bit integer.

                  +-------+-------------+---------------+

   The value "0-5" was not defined in any document or in the ad hoc
   registry.  As per consensus by the DTNRG research group, it is
   reserved per this document.

3.3.  Bundle Processing Control Flags

   The Bundle Protocol has a Bundle Processing Control Flags field (see
   Section 4.2 of [RFC5050]) encoded as an SDNV (see Section 2).  An
   IANA registry has been set up as follows.

   The registration policy for this registry is: Specification Required

   The Value range is: Variable length.  Maximum number of flag bit
   positions: 64
