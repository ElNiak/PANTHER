                    URN Namespace for MEF Documents

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) "mef" for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   MEF Forum (https://www.mef.net).  MEF specifies and manages resources
   that utilize this URN identification model.  Management activities
   for these and other resources types are handled by the manager of the
   MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry.

1.  Introduction

   The MEF Forum (MEF) is a nonprofit international industry standards
   organization dedicated to the worldwide adoption of Carrier Ethernet
   (CE) networks and services.  The forum creates specifications in the
   areas of Services, Architecture, and Operations and Management.

   As part of these specifications efforts, there is a need to identify
   identifiers in a managed namespace that are unique and persistent.
   To ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a
   registration of a specific URN Syntax [RFC2141] Namespace Identifier
   (NID) for use by MEF is being specified in this document.

2.  URN Specification for MEF

   Namespace ID:

      mef

   Registration information:

      registration version number: 1

      registration date: 2016-02-08

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization

      Name:     MEF Forum

      Address:  6033 W. Century Boulevard, Suite 1107
                Los Angeles, CA  90045
                United States

      Designated contact:

         Role: Manager, MEF Namespace

         Email: namespace@mef.net

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The syntax of namespace-specific strings for the "mef" namespace
      is <NSS> in RFC 2141.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      MEF publishes information regarding the registered resources in
      the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry
      (https://www.mef.net/MANN).

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      MEF will manage resource classes using the "mef" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  MEF is expected to guarantee the uniqueness of the
      strings themselves, or it may permit secondary responsibility for
      certain defined resources.

      MEF could allow for use of experimental type values for testing
      purposes only.  Note that using experimental types may create
      collisions as multiple users may use the same values for different
      resources and specific strings.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      MEF will update the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry
      to document the registered resources that will use the "mef" NID.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      Assignment of a URN from the MEF namespace will be documented as
      part of the MEF Assigned Names and Numbers (MANN) registry.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with a Resolution Discovery System
      (RDS).  Therefore, this process is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The entire URN is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of MEF activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following are examples of URNs that MEF is looking to assign:

      urn:mef:yang:mef-services

      urn:mef:yang:mef-interfaces

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations other than those normally
   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general, which are
   described in "Function Requirements for Uniform Resource Names"
   [RFC1737] and "URN Syntax" [RFC2141].

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has added a new entry ("mef") in the "Uniform
   Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry available from the IANA
   site (https://www.iana.org).
