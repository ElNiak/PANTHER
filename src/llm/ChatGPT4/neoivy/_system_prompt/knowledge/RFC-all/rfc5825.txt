1.  Introduction

   The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension document
   set [RFC4952] [RFC5336] [RFC5335] [RFC5337] expands Email address
   structure, syntax, and email header format.  To avoid rejection of
   internationalized email messages, the downgrading mechanism [RFC5504]
   converts an internationalized message to a traditional email message
   when a server in the delivery path does not support the UTF8SMTP
   extension.  The downgraded message is a traditional email message,
   except the message has "Downgraded-" header fields.

   A perfect reverse-function of the downgrading does not exist because
   the encoding defined in [RFC2047] is not exactly reversible and
   "Received" header field downgrading may remove FOR clause
   information.  The restoration of the downgrading should be done once
   at the final destination of the downgraded message such as Mail User
   Agents (MUAs) or IMAP servers.  This document describes the
   restoration methods for displaying downgraded messages in MUAs.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

RFC 5825             Displaying Downgraded Messages           April 2010


   Specialized terms used in this specification are defined in the EAI
   overview [RFC4952] or in [RFC5321], [RFC5322], or the MIME documents
   [RFC2045], [RFC2047], [RFC2183], and [RFC2231].

   This document depends on [RFC5335] and [RFC5504].  Key words used in
   those documents are used in this document, too.

   The term "MIME decode" is used for both "encoded-word" decoding
   defined by [RFC2047] and MIME parameter value decoding defined by
   [RFC2231].

3.  Converting Downgraded Message Headers for Display

3.1.  Considerations

   The order of some header fields (such as "Resent-*" fields) is
   significant.  The process of regenerating the original fields from
   the downgraded ones MUST NOT reorder the fields.

   In order to regenerate a field from a specific downgraded header
   field, it's necessary to find the corresponding replacement in the
   current message.  If the corresponding field cannot be found, the
   downgraded header field in question cannot be regenerated and used.

   In any case where reconstruction of a particular downgraded header
   field fails, both header fields (the "downgraded-YYY" header field
   and the "YYY" header field) SHOULD be left in the message as they
   are.  The MUA MAY choose to communicate the situation to the user
   (see the "Security Considerations" section).

3.2.  The Process

   A MUA MAY decode and regenerate the original header fields of the
   message (Mail Transport Agents (MTAs) and Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs)
   SHOULD NOT attempt to do this; it SHOULD be left to the MUA).  This
   procedure can be used to approximately reverse the downgrade process,
   but it will not always construct the original header fields exactly.

   Three types of downgraded header fields are described in Section 3 of
   [RFC5504]:

   1.  "Envelope Information Preservation Header Fields", described in
       RFC5504 Section 3.1 and in Section 3.2.1, below.

   2.  "Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in
       RFC5504 Section 3.2 and in Section 3.2.2, below.

RFC 5825             Displaying Downgraded Messages           April 2010


   3.  "Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields", described in
       RFC5504 Section 3.3 and in Section 3.2.3, below.

   After processing downgraded header fields, decode all header fields,
   as described in [RFC2047] and [RFC2231].

3.2.1.  No Reconstruction of the Envelope Information Preservation
        Header Fields

   Envelope information preservation header fields are new fields that
   might have been added by the downgrade process.  Because they do not
   represent fields that appeared in the original message, this process
   is not applicable to them.

3.2.2.  Reconstructing the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header
        Fields

   Reconstructing address header fields' preservation header fields is
   OPTIONAL, and a decision MAY be made on each field, individually.  In
   particular, it might be less important to process the "Resent-*"
   header fields, so an implementation MAY choose to skip those.

   To construct a displayable copy of a header field from one of these
   downgraded header fields, follow this procedure:

   1.  In an edit buffer, create a new header field:

       (a)  For the field name, remove the "Downgraded-" prefix from the
            downgraded field name.  For example, "Downgraded-From"
            becomes "From", and "Downgraded-Resent-To" becomes
            "Resent-To".

       (b)  For the field value, decode the MIME-encoded value of the
            downgraded field according to [RFC2047].

   2.  Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading", defined in Section 5 of
       [RFC5504], to the field in the edit buffer.  The process
       generates two header fields, one is ASCII header field and the
       other is the Address Header Fields' Preservation Header Field.
       Put the generated ASCII header field into comparison buffer 1.

   3.  Canonicalize the header field in the comparison buffer 1:

       1.  Unfold all header field continuation lines as described in
           [RFC5322].

RFC 5825             Displaying Downgraded Messages           April 2010


       2.  Ensure that there is one space character before and one after
           the <mailbox-list> separator ",".  If a space character is
           missing, insert one.

       3.  Ensure that there is one space character before and one after
           each <comment>.  If a space character is missing, insert one.

       4.  Decode each <encoded-word> whose charset is "UTF-8".

       5.  Convert all sequences of one or more WSP characters to a
           single space character.  WSP characters here include those
           before and after a line-folding boundary.

       6.  Delete all WSP characters at the end of each unfolded header
           field value.

       7.  Delete any WSP characters remaining before and after the
           colon separating the header field name from the header field
           value, retaining the colon separator.

   4.  Locate the first instance of the corresponding field in the
       message's headers.

   5.  Canonicalize the located field as in step 3, and put the result
       into comparison buffer 2.

   6.  Compare the header field in comparison buffer 1 with the header
       field in comparison buffer 2.  If they match, go to step 8.

   7.  Locate the next instance of the corresponding field in the
       message's headers.  If one is found, go to step 5.  If none is
       found, stop: you cannot use this downgraded field because you
       can't find its replacement in the message.

   8.  Replace the located header field with the one in the edit buffer.
       You MUST NOT reorder the header fields when you do this; it's
       important to replace the field in the same place.  Remove the
       target downgraded header field in the message header.

3.2.3.  The Unknown Header Fields' Preservation Header Fields

   The unknown header fields' preservation header fields SHOULD be left
   as they are unless the MUA has special knowledge of a particular
   field.  An MUA with such knowledge MAY use the procedure similar to
   the procedure in Section 3.2.2, above, for those fields about which
   it knows.  (Note that the whitespace canonicalization rule might not
   be applicable to some header fields.)

4.  Security Considerations

   While information in any email header should usually be treated with
   some suspicion, current email systems commonly employ various
   mechanisms and protocols to make the information more trustworthy.
   For example, an organization's boundary MTA can modify "From" lines
   so that messages arriving from outside the organization are easily
   distinguishable from internal emails.  As a result of that rewriting,
   the "From" header field might not match the "Downgraded-From" header
   field.

   A MUA MAY emphasize bogus or broken address header fields'
   preservation header fields found in step 7 of Section 3.2.2.

   Hiding the information from the actual header fields when using the
   "Downgraded-" header fields does not cause loss of information if
   generating MIME-decoded header fields in step 1 of Section 3.2.2 and
   the comparison done in step 7 are successful.  To ensure that no
   information is lost, a MUA SHOULD have a function that uses the
   actual message that was received (with/without MIME decoding) to
   render the message.

   We have focused, here, on issues with displaying downgraded messages.
   For more discussion of downgraded and internationalized messages in
   general, see the "Security Considerations" section in [RFC5504] and
   [RFC4952].

A.1.  Displaying Example

   This example shows how to display the message in Figure 2, above,
   using the process defined in Section 3.  For simplicity, we will show
   the reconstruction of all the applicable fields at once.

   Selecting all Downgraded-* fields gives this:

Downgraded-Mail-From: =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-local@example.com_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-local@example.com>>?=
Downgraded-Rcpt-To: =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Unknown-Field: =?UTF-8?Q?NON-ASCII-Unknown?=
Downgraded-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-local_<NON-ASCII-local@example.com_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-local@example.com>>?=
Downgraded-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Cc: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote2_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org>?=
Downgraded-Resent-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Resent-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-reto_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-reto@example.net_<ASCII-reto@example.net>>?=

                    Figure 4: Downgraded header fields

   Two of the fields, "Downgraded-Mail-From" and "Downgraded-Rcpt-To",
   are envelope information preservation header fields, and will not be
   reconstructed.  One field, "Downgraded-Unknown-Field", is an unknown
   header fields' preservation header field and will also not be
   reconstructed.  That leaves the address header fields' preservation
   header fields to be reconstructed.

Downgraded-From: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-local_<NON-ASCII-local@example.com_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<ASCII-local@example.com>>?=
Downgraded-To: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote1_?=
 =?UTF-8?Q?<NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net_<ASCII-remote1@example.net>>?=
Downgraded-Cc: =?UTF-8?Q?DISPLAY-remote2_?=

   Now, perform step 1 to the downgraded header fields shown in Figure 5
   and create an edit buffer.

   From: DISPLAY-local <NON-ASCII-local@example.com
    <ASCII-local@example.com>>
   To: DISPLAY-remote1 <NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net
    <ASCII-remote1@example.net>>
   Cc: DISPLAY-remote2 <NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org>
   Resent-From: DISPLAY-remote1
    <NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net <ASCII-remote1@example.net>>
   Resent-To: DISPLAY-reto
    <NON-ASCII-reto@example.net <ASCII-reto@example.net>>

                  Figure 6: edit buffer: Output of step 1

   Apply "Email Header Fields Downgrading" to the "edit buffer".  It
   generates downgraded ASCII header fields and the address header
   fields' preservation header fields.  The latter fields are the same
   as the downgraded header fields.  Put the former fields into
   "comparison buffer 1".

   From:DISPLAY-local <ASCII-local@example.com>
   To:DISPLAY-remote1 <ASCII-remote1@example.net>
   Cc:DISPLAY-remote2 Internationalized address
    NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org removed:;
   Resent-From:DISPLAY-remote1 <ASCII-remote1@example.net>
   Resent-To:DISPLAY-reto <ASCII-reto@example.net>

              Figure 7: comparison buffer 1: Output of step 3

   Perform steps 4 to 6, comparison, for each header field.  Five header
   fields, "From", "To", "Cc", "Resent-From" and "Resent-To" fields will
   match, and we will proceed to step 8.  (Step 7, iteration, does not
   apply in this example.

   Perform step 8, replacing all applicable fields, without changing the
   order.  Then, do MIME decoding on everything, for display.

   Return-Path: <ASCII-local@example.com>
   Received: ...
   Downgraded-Mail-From: <NON-ASCII-local@example.com
    <ASCII-local@example.com>>
   Downgraded-Rcpt-To: <NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net>
    <ASCII-remote1@example.net>
   Message-Id: MESSAGE_ID
   Mime-Version: 1.0
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
   Subject: NON-ASCII-SUBJECT
   Downgraded-Unknown-Field: NON-ASCII-Unknown
   From: DISPLAY-local <NON-ASCII-local@example.com
    <ASCII-local@example.com>>
   To: DISPLAY-remote1 <NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net
    <ASCII-remote1@example.net>>
   Cc: DISPLAY-remote2 <NON-ASCII-remote2@example.org>
   Resent-From: DISPLAY-remote1 <NON-ASCII-remote1@example.net
    <ASCII-remote1@example.net>>
   Resent-To: DISPLAY-reto <NON-ASCII-reto@example.net
    <ASCII-reto@example.net>>
   Date: DATE

                        Figure 8: The final result

   As a result, in this simple example, some original header fields are
   now displayed in their original form.  Differences between Figure 1
   and Figure 8 are Return-Path, Downgraded-Mail-From,
   Downgraded-Rcpt-To, and Downgraded-Unknown-Field.
