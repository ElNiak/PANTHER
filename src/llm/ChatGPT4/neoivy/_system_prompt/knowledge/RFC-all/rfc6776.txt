1.  Introduction

   This document defines one new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source
   Description (SDES) [RFC3550] item and one new Extended Report (XR)
   block carrying parameters that identify and describe a measurement
   period to which one or more other RTCP XR blocks may refer.

   The SDES item provides a field for an application-specific auxiliary
   identifier.  This identifier may be used to correlate data in XR
   blocks within an RTP session with data from a non-RTP session.

   An RTCP Measurement Identity SDES packet may be associated with a set
   of RTCP XR metrics blocks that share the same application-specific
   measurement identifier.

   The XR block does not contain any measurement results (metrics).
   Instead, it provides information relevant to a measurement reported
   in one or more other block types, including:

   o  the sequence number of the first packet of the RTP session,

   o  the extended sequence numbers of the first packet of the current
      measurement interval, and the last packet included in the
      measurement,

RFC 6776            Measurement Identity and Duration       October 2012


   o  the duration of the most recent measurement interval, and

   o  the duration of the interval applicable to cumulative measurements
      (which may be the duration of the RTP session to date).

   The calculation method of the extended RTP sequence number is
   provided in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].

   The RTCP XR block containing the measurement information is intended
   to provide a single copy of the information necessary to relate
   measurement data in the RTCP XR blocks to the stream and measurement
   period to which they refer.  Commonly, multiple other small metric
   blocks contain measurement data for the same stream and period, and
   overhead would be large if all of these metric blocks carried
   duplicated data for measurement identification.

   The RTCP XR block may be associated with a set of RTCP XR metrics
   blocks that share the same information relevant to a reported
   measurement.  There may be several such sets in an RTCP packet, in
   which each set shares the same information relevant to a reported
   measurement.  There may also be RTCP XR blocks in the packet that are
   not associated with a Measurement Information block, for example,
   blocks that were defined before the Measurement Identity and
   information mechanism were introduced by this document.

1.1.  RTCP and RTCP XRs

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defines an extensible structure for reporting by using an RTCP XR.
   [RFC3611] also defines the use of XR blocks.  This document defines a
   new Extended Report block.

1.2.  Performance Metrics Framework

   The Performance Metrics Framework [RFC6390] provides guidance on the
   definition and specification of performance metrics.  The RTP
   Monitoring Architectures [MONARCH] provides guidelines for reporting
   block format using RTCP XR.  The SDES item and XR block described in
   this document are in accordance with [RFC6390] and [MONARCH].

1.3.  Applicability

   The RTCP SDES item and the RTCP XR block defined in this document
   provide information relevant to the measurements for members of a
   family of RTCP XR metrics blocks that are designed to use it.  To use
   the mechanism defined here, the RTCP XR block containing measurement
   information is not required to be in the same RTCP packet as the SDES
   item containing measurement identity.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Standards Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Measurement Identity SDES Item

   This section defines the format of the Measurement Identity SDES
   item.  The SDES item is carried in the RTCP SDES packet.  The packet
   format for the RTCP SDES is defined in Section 6.5 of [RFC3550].
   Each SDES packet is composed of a header with fixed-length fields for
   version, source count, packet type (PT), and length, followed by zero
   or more SDES items.  In the SDES packet, the PT field is set to SDES
   (202).

3.1.  APSI: Application-Specific Identifier SDES Item

    0                   1                   2                   3

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |   ....
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The application-specific identifier is an additional identifier that
   is useful in the context of a specific application, e.g., an MPEG-2
   transport identifier [MPEG2].  This item MUST be ignored by
   applications that are not configured to make use of it.  The
   identifier is variable length.  Its length is described by the length
   field.  The value of the length field does not include the two-octet
   SDES item header.

                          Report Block Structure

4.2.  Definition of Fields in Measurement Information Report Block

   Block type (BT): 8 bits

      A Measurement Information Block is identified by the constant 14.

   Reserved: 8 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers.

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words minus one.  For
      the Measurement Information Block, the block length is equal to 7.

   SSRC of source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

RFC 6776            Measurement Identity and Duration       October 2012


   Reserved: 16 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers.

   First sequence number: 16 bits

      The RTP sequence number of the first received RTP packet of the
      session, used to determine the number of packets contributing to
      cumulative measurements.

   Extended first sequence number of interval: 32 bits

      The extended RTP sequence number of the first received RTP packet
      of the current measurement interval.  The extended sequence number
      is expressed as the low 16-bit value containing the sequence
      number received in an RTP data packet and the most significant
      16-bit value containing the corresponding count of sequence number
      cycles.  For additional information on extended sequence numbers,
      see the "extended highest sequence number received" definition in
      Section 6.4.1 of RFC 3550 and Appendix A.1 of RFC 3550.

   Extended last sequence number: 32 bits

      The extended RTP sequence number of the last received RTP packet
      that contributed to this measurement.  The extended sequence
      number is expressed as the low 16-bit value containing the
      sequence number received in an RTP data packet and the most
      significant 16-bit value containing the corresponding count of
      sequence number cycles.  For additional information on extended
      sequence numbers, see the "extended highest sequence number
      received" definition in Section 6.4.1 of RFC 3550 and Appendix A.1
      of RFC 3550.

   Measurement Duration (Interval): 32 bits

      The duration, expressed in units of 1/65536 seconds, of the
      reporting interval applicable to Interval reports that use this
      Measurement Information Block.  The value of this field can be
      calculated by the receiver of the RTP media stream, for example,
      based on received RTP media packets or using the RTCP method
      described in [RFC3550].

RFC 6776            Measurement Identity and Duration       October 2012


   Measurement Duration (Cumulative): 64 bits

      The duration of the reporting interval applicable to Cumulative
      reports that use this Measurement Information Block.  The value of
      this field is represented using a 64-bit NTP-format timestamp as
      defined in [RFC5905], which is a 64-bit unsigned fixed-point
      number with the integer part in the first 32 bits and the
      fractional part in the last 32 bits.  It can be calculated by the
      receiver of the RTP media stream, for example, based on received
      RTP media packets or using the RTCP method described in [RFC3550].

5.  IANA Considerations

   A new SDES item type for RTCP SDES and a new XR block type for RTCP
   XR have been registered with IANA.  For general guidelines on IANA
   considerations, refer to [RFC3550] for RTCP SDES and [RFC3611] for
   RTCP XR.

5.1.  New RTCP SDES Item Type Value

   This document adds the Measurement Identity SDES item to the IANA
   "RTP SDES item types" registry as follows:

   abbrev.      name                               value
   APSI         Application-Specific Identifier    10

5.2.  New RTCP XR Block Type Value

   This document assigns the block type value 14 in the IANA "RTCP XR
   Block Type Registry" to the "Measurement Information Block".

5.3.  Contact Information for Registrations

   The contact information for the registrations is:

   101 Software Avenue, Yuhua District
   Nanjing, Jiangsu  210012
   China

6.  Security Considerations

   RTCP reports can contain sensitive information, including information
   about the nature and duration of a session established between two or
   more endpoints.  Therefore, the use of security mechanisms with RTP,
   as documented in Section 9 of [RFC3550], applies.
