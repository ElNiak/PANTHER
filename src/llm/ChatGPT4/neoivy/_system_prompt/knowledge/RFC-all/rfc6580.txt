 IANA Registries for the Remote Direct Data Placement (RDDP) Protocols

Abstract

   The original RFCs that specified the Remote Direct Data Placement
   (RDDP) protocol suite did not create IANA registries for RDDP error
   codes, operation codes, and function codes.  Extensions to the RDDP
   protocols now require these registries to be created.  This memo
   creates the RDDP registries, populates them with values defined in
   the original RDDP RFCs, and provides guidance to IANA for future
   assignment of code points within these registries.

1.  Introduction

   The original RFCs that specified the RDDP protocol suite [RFC5040]
   [RFC5041] [RFC5043] [RFC5044] did not create IANA registries.
   Extensions to the RDDP protocols [RFC6581] [RMP-EXT] now require
   creation and use of IANA registries.  This memo creates the RDDP-
   related IANA registries, specifies their initial contents based on
   the values defined in the original RDDP RFCs, and provides guidance
   to IANA for future assignments from these registries.  In addition,
   this memo allocates operation code and function code points for
   experimental use [RFC3692].

2.  Security Considerations

   Since this document is only concerned with creation and IANA
   management of RDDP registries, it raises no new security issues.

   However, a few words are necessary about the use of the experimental
   code points defined in Sections 3.4 and 3.5.  Potentially harmful
   side effects from the use of the experimental values need to be
   carefully evaluated before deploying any experiment across networks
   that the owner of the experiment does not entirely control.  Guidance
   given in [RFC3692] about the use of experimental values needs to be
   followed.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Allocation requests for the registries created by this memo may come
   with a suggested numerical value or values that should be assigned.
   Such suggestions are useful when early implementations have already
   chosen particular code points before the final RFC is published.  If
   the allocation request in general is accepted, such suggestions may
   be honored if the suggested value is still free to be assigned.

RFC 6580              IANA Considerations for RDDP            April 2012


   This memo creates the following RDDP registries for IANA to manage:

      o RDMAP Errors (Section 3.1)
      o DDP Errors (Section 3.2)
      o MPA Errors (Section 3.3)
      o RDMAP Message Operation Codes (Section 3.4)
      o SCTP Function Codes for DDP Stream Session Control (Section 3.5)

   Each of the following sections specifies a registry, its initial
   contents, and the allocation policy in more detail.

3.1.  RDMAP Errors

   Name of the registry: "RDMAP Errors"

   Namespace details: An RDMAP (Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol)
   error is a 16-bit field divided into three subfields [RFC5040]:

      o 4-bit Layer, always 0x0 for RDMAP errors
      o 4-bit Error Type
      o 8-bit Error Code

   The Error Code field is optional for this registry, as Error Codes
   are not used with all RDMAP Error Types.  When no numerical Error
   Code is registered, any 8-bit value may be used as the Error Code, as
   the Layer and Error Type values are sufficient to specify the error.
   For this reason, if an RDMAP Error Type is registered without an
   Error Code, an entry must not be added to this registry with an Error
   Code for the same Error Type.

   Information that must be provided to assign a new value: An IESG-
   approved Standards-Track specification defining the semantics and
   interoperability requirements of the proposed new value and the
   fields to be recorded in the registry.

   Fields to record in the registry: Layer/Error-Type/Error-Code, Error-
   Type-Name/Error-Code-Name, RFC Reference.  The Error-Code and Error-
   Code-Name are omitted for Error-Types that do not have Error-Codes.

   When a specific Error Code is not registered, the registry entry
   contains the string "ALL" for the Error Code instead of a numerical
   value, and the Error Code Name is omitted from the registry entry.

   0x0/0x1/0x01, Remote Protection Error / Base or bounds violation,
   [RFC5040]

   0x0/0x1/0x02, Remote Protection Error / Access rights violation,
   [RFC5040]

   0x0/0x1/0x03, Remote Protection Error / Steering Tag not associated
   with RDMAP Stream, [RFC5040]

   0x0/0x1/0x04, Remote Protection Error / Tagged Offset wrap, [RFC5040]

3.2.  DDP Errors

   Name of the registry: "DDP Errors"

   Namespace details: A DDP (Direct Data Placement) error is a 16-bit
   field divided into three subfields [RFC5041]:

      o 4-bit Layer, always 0x1 for DDP errors
      o 4-bit Error Type
      o 8-bit Error Code

   The Error Code field is required for this registry, except for the
   registry entry that reserves a set of errors for use by the Lower
   Layer Protocol.  When no numerical Error Code is registered, any
   8-bit value may be used as the Error Code, as the Layer and Error
   Type values are sufficient to specify the error.  For this reason, if
   a DDP Error Type is registered without an Error Code, an entry must
   not be added to this registry with an Error Code for the same Error
   Type.

   Information that must be provided to assign a new value: An IESG-
   approved Standards-Track specification defining the semantics and
   interoperability requirements of the proposed new value and the
   fields to be recorded in the registry.

   Fields to record in the registry: Layer/Error-Type/Error-Code, Error-
   Type-Name/Error-Code-Name, RFC Reference.

   The last registry entry in the initial registry contents below
   reserves a set of errors for use by the Lower Layer Protocol.  That
   entry uses "ALL" for the Error Code and omits the Error Code Name.
   The use of "ALL" is unique to that entry; all other entries in this
   registry are required to contain a numeric Error Code and an Error
   Code Name.

   Initial registry contents:

   0x1/0x0/0x00, Local Catastrophic, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x1/0x00, Tagged Buffer Error / Invalid Steering Tag, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x1/0x01, Tagged Buffer Error / Base or bounds violation,
   [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x1/0x02, Tagged Buffer Error / Steering Tag not associated with
   DDP Stream, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x1/0x03, Tagged Buffer Error / Tagged Offset wrap, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x1/0x04, Tagged Buffer Error / Invalid DDP version, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x2/0x01, Untagged Buffer Error / Invalid Queue Number, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x2/0x02, Untagged Buffer Error / Invalid Message Sequence Number
   - no buffer available, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x2/0x03, Untagged Buffer Error / Invalid Message Sequence Number
   - Message Sequence Number range is not valid, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x2/0x04, Untagged Buffer Error / Invalid Message Offset,
   [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x2/0x05, Untagged Buffer Error / DDP Message too long for
   available buffer, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x2/0x06, Untagged Buffer Error / Invalid DDP version, [RFC5041]

   0x1/0x3/ALL , Reserved for use by Lower Layer Protocol, [RFC5041]

   All combinations not listed above that combine 0x1 as the Layer with
   an Error Type and Error Code are Unassigned and available to IANA for
   assignment.

   Allocation Policy: Standards Action [RFC5226]

3.3  MPA Errors

   Name of the registry: "MPA Errors"

   Namespace details: An MPA (Marker PDU Aligned Framing) error is a
   16-bit field divided into three subfields [RFC5044]:

      o 4-bit Layer, always 0x2 for MPA errors
      o 4-bit Error Type
      o 8-bit Error Code

   The Error Code field is required for this registry.

   Information that must be provided to assign a new value: An IESG-
   approved Standards-Track specification defining the semantics and
   interoperability requirements of the proposed new value and the
   fields to be recorded in the registry.

   Fields to record in the registry: Layer/Error-Type/Error-Code, Error-
   Type-Name/Error-Code-Name, RFC Reference.

   The string "ALL" is not used for the Error Code in this registry;
   every entry is required to contain a numeric Error Code and an Error
   Code Name.

   Initial registry contents:

   0x2/0x0/0x01, MPA Error / TCP connection closed, terminated, or lost,
   [RFC5044]

   0x2/0x0/0x02, MPA Error / MPA CRC Error, [RFC5044]

   0x2/0x0/0x03, MPA Error / MPA Marker and ULPDU Length field mismatch,
   [RFC5044]

   0x2/0x0/0x04, MPA Error / Invalid MPA Request Frame or MPA Response
   Frame, [RFC5044]

   All combinations not listed above that combine 0x2 as the Layer with
   an Error Type and Error Code are Unassigned and available to IANA for
   assignment.

   Allocation Policy: Standards Action [RFC5226]

3.4  RDMAP Message Operation Codes

   Name of the registry: "RDMAP Message Operation Codes"

   Namespace details: RDMAP Operation Codes are 4-bit values [RFC5040].

   Information that must be provided to assign a new value: An IESG-
   approved Standards-Track specification defining the semantics and
   interoperability requirements of the proposed new value and the
   fields to be recorded in the registry.
