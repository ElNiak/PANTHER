          Recommendations for RSVP-TE and Segment Routing (SR)
                 Label Switched Path (LSP) Coexistence

Abstract

   Operators are looking to introduce services over Segment Routing (SR)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks running Resource Reservation
   Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) LSPs.  In some instances,
   operators are also migrating existing services from RSVP-TE to SR
   LSPs.  For example, there might be certain services that are well
   suited for SR and need to coexist with RSVP-TE in the same network.
   Such introduction or migration of traffic to SR might require
   coexistence with RSVP-TE in the same network for an extended period
   of time, depending on the operator's intent.  The following document
   provides solution options for keeping the traffic engineering
   database consistent across the network, accounting for the different
   bandwidth utilization between SR and RSVP-TE.

1.  Introduction

   Introduction of SR [RFC8402] in the same network domain as RSVP-TE
   [RFC3209] presents the problem of accounting for SR traffic and
   making RSVP-TE aware of the actual available bandwidth on the network
   links.  RSVP-TE is not aware of how much bandwidth is being consumed
   by SR services on the network links; hence, both at computation time
   (for a distributed computation) and at signaling time, RSVP-TE LSPs
   will incorrectly place loads.  This is true where RSVP-TE paths are
   distributed or centrally computed without a common entity managing
   both SR and RSVP-TE computation for the entire network domain.

RFC 8426             RSVP-TE and SR LSP Coexistence            July 2018


   The problem space can be generalized as a dark bandwidth problem to
   cases where any other service exists in the network that runs in
   parallel across common links and whose bandwidth is not reflected in
   the available and reserved values in the Traffic Engineering Database
   (TED).  In most practical instances, given the static nature of the
   traffic demands, limiting the reservable bandwidth available to RSVP-
   TE has been an acceptable solution.  However, in the case of SR
   traffic, there is assumed to be very dynamic traffic demands, and
   there is considerable risk associated with stranding capacity or
   overbooking service traffic resulting in traffic drops.

   The high-level requirements to consider are:

   1.  Placement of SR LSPs in the same domain as RSVP-TE LSPs must not
       introduce inaccuracies in the TED used by distributed or
       centralized path computation engines.

   2.  Engines that compute RSVP-TE paths may have no knowledge of the
       existence of the SR paths in the same domain.

   3.  Engines that compute RSVP-TE paths should not require a software
       upgrade or change to their path-computation logic.

   4.  Protocol extensions should be avoided or be minimal as, in many
       cases, this coexistence of RSVP-TE and SR may be needed only
       during a transition phase.

   5.  Placement of SR LSPs in the same domain as RSVP-TE LSPs that are
       computed in a distributed fashion must not require migration to a
       central controller architecture for the RSVP-TE LSPs.

3.  Solution Options

   The following section lists SR and RSVP coexistence solution options.
   A specific solution is not recommended as all solutions are valid,
   even though some may not satisfy all the requirements.  If a solution
   is acceptable for an operator based on their deployment model, then
   such a solution can be chosen.

RFC 8426             RSVP-TE and SR LSP Coexistence            July 2018


3.1.  Static Partitioning of Bandwidth

   In this model, the static reservable bandwidth of an interface can be
   statically partitioned between SR and RSVP-TE; each one can operate
   within that bandwidth allocation and SHOULD NOT preempt the other.

   While it is possible to configure RSVP-TE to only reserve up to a
   certain maximum link bandwidth and manage the remaining link
   bandwidth for other services, this is a deployment where SR and RSVP-
   TE are separated in the same network (ships in the night) and can
   lead to suboptimal link bandwidth utilization not allowing each to
   consume more, if required and constraining the respective
   deployments.

   The downside of this approach is the inability to use the reservable
   bandwidth effectively and the inability to use bandwidth left unused
   by the other protocol.

3.2.  Centralized Management of Available Capacity

   In this model, a central controller performs path placement for both
   RSVP-TE and SR LSPs.  The controller manages and updates its own view
   of the in-use and available capacity.  As the controller is a single
   common entity managing the network it can have a unified and
   consistent view of the available capacity at all times.

   A practical drawback of this model is that it requires the
   introduction of a central controller managing the RSVP-TE LSPs as a
   prerequisite to the deployment of any SR LSPs.  Therefore, this
   approach is not practical for networks where distributed TE with
   RSVP-TE LSPs is already deployed, as it requires a redesign of the
   network and is not backwards compatible.  This does not satisfy
   requirement 5.

   Note that it is not enough for the controller to just maintain the
   unified view of the available capacity, it must also perform the path
   computation for the RSVP-TE LSPs, as the reservations for the SR LSPs
   are not reflected in the TED.

3.3.  Flooding SR Utilization in IGP

   Using techniques in [RFC7810], [RFC7471], and [RFC7823], the SR
   utilization information can be flooded in IGP-TE, and the RSVP-TE
   path computation engine (Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF)) can
   be changed to consider this information.  This requires changes to
   the RSVP-TE path computation logic and would require upgrades in
   deployments where distributed computation is done across the network.

   This does not fit with requirements 3 and 4 mentioned earlier.

3.4.  Running SR over RSVP-TE

   SR can run over dedicated RSVP-TE LSPs that carry only SR traffic.
   In this model, the LSPs can be one-hop or multi-hop and can provide
   bandwidth reservation for the SR traffic based on functionality such
   as auto-bandwidth.  The model of deployment would be similar in
   nature to running LDP over RSVP-TE.  This would allow the TED to stay
   consistent across the network and any other RSVP-TE LSPs will also be
   aware of the SR traffic reservations.  In this approach, non-SR
   traffic MUST NOT take the SR-dedicated RSVP-TE LSPs, unless required
   by policy.

   The drawback of this solution is that it requires SR to rely on RSVP-
   TE for deployment.  Furthermore, the accounting accuracy/frequency of
   this method is dependent on performance of auto-bandwidth for RSVP-
   TE.  Note that, for this method to work, the SR-dedicated RSVP-TE
   LSPs must be set up with the best setup and hold priorities in the
   network.

3.5.  TED Consistency by Reflecting SR Traffic

   The solution relies on dynamically measuring SR traffic utilization
   on each TE interface and reducing the bandwidth allowed for use by
   RSVP-TE.  It is assumed that SR traffic receives precedence in terms
   of the placement on the path over RSVP traffic (that is, RSVP traffic
   can be preempted from the path in case of insufficient resources).
   This is logically equivalent to SR traffic having the best preemption
   priority in the network.  Note that this does not necessarily mean
   that SR traffic has higher QoS priority; in fact, SR and RSVP traffic
   may be in the same QoS class.

RFC 8426             RSVP-TE and SR LSP Coexistence            July 2018


   Reducing the bandwidth allowed for use by RSVP-TE can be explored
   using the three parameters available in IGP-TE ([RFC5305] [RFC3630]),
   namely Maximum-Link-Bandwidth, Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth, and
   Unreserved-Bandwidth.

   o  Maximum-Link-Bandwidth: This parameter can be adjusted to
      accommodate the bandwidth required for SR traffic with cascading
      impacts on Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth and Unreserved-Bandwidth.
      However, changing the maximum bandwidth for the TE link will
      prevent any compute engine for SR or RSVP from determining the
      real static bandwidth of the TE link.  Further, when the Maximum-
      Reservable-Bandwidth is derived from the Maximum-Link-Bandwidth,
      its definition changes since Maximum-Link-Bandwidth will account
      for the SR traffic.

   o  Unreserved-Bandwidth: SR traffic could directly adjust the
      Unreserved-Bandwidth, without impacting Maximum-Link-Bandwidth or
      Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth.  This model is equivalent to the
      option described in Section 3.4.  Furthermore this would result in
      overloading IGP-TE advertisements to directly reflect both RSVP-TE
      bandwidth bookings and SR bandwidth measurements.

   o  Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: As the preferred option, SR traffic
      could adjust the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth, with cascading
      impact on the Unreserved-Bandwidth.

   The following methodology can be used at every TE node for this
   solution, using the following parameters:

   o  T: Traffic statistics collection time interval.

   o  k: The number of traffic statistics samples that can provide a
      smoothing function to the statistics collection.  The value of k
      is a constant integer multiplier greater or equal to 1.

   o  N: Traffic averaging calculation (adjustment) interval such that N
      = k * T.

   o  Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: The maximum available bandwidth for
      RSVP-TE.

   o  If Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) [RFC4124] is
      enabled, the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth SHOULD be interpreted as
      the aggregate bandwidth constraint across all Class-Types
      independent of the Bandwidth Constraints model.

RFC 8426             RSVP-TE and SR LSP Coexistence            July 2018


   o  Initial Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth: The Maximum-reservable-
      bandwidth for TE when no SR traffic or RSVP-TE reservations exist
      on the interface.

   o  RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-priority-X: Maximum-Reservable-
      Bandwidth - sum of (existing reservations at priority X and all
      priorities better than X).

   o  SR traffic threshold percentage: The percentage difference of
      traffic demand that, when exceeded, can result in a change to the
      RSVP-TE Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth.

   o  IGP-TE update threshold: Specifies the frequency at which IGP-TE
      updates should be triggered based on TE bandwidth updates on a
      link.

   o  M: An optional multiplier that can be applied to the SR traffic
      average.  This multiplier provides the ability to grow or shrink
      the bandwidth used by SR.  Appendix A offers further guidance on
      M.

   At every interval T, each node SHOULD collect the SR traffic
   statistics for each of its TE interfaces.  The measured SR traffic
   includes all labeled SR traffic and any traffic entering the SR
   network over that TE interface.  Further, at every interval N, given
   a configured SR traffic threshold percentage and a set of collected
   SR traffic statistics samples across the interval N, the SR traffic
   average (or any other traffic metric depending on the algorithm used)
   over this period is calculated.  This method of sampling traffic
   statistics and adjusting bandwidth reservation accordingly is similar
   to how bandwidth gets adjusted for auto-bandwidth RSVP-TE LSPs.

   If the difference between the new calculated SR traffic average and
   the current SR traffic average (that was computed in the prior
   adjustment) is at least SR traffic threshold percentage, then two
   values MUST be updated:

   o  New Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth = Initial Maximum-Reservable-
      Bandwidth - (new SR traffic average * M)

   o  New RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-priority-X = New Maximum-
      Reservable-Bandwidth - sum of (existing reservations at priority X
      and all priorities better than X)

   A DS-TE LSR that advertises a Bandwidth Constraints TLV should update
   the bandwidth constraints for class-types based on operator policy.
   For example, when Russian Dolls Model (RDM) [RFC4127] is in use, then




Sitaraman, et al.             Informational                     [Page 7]

RFC 8426             RSVP-TE and SR LSP Coexistence            July 2018


   only BC0 may be updated.  Whereas, when Maximum Allocation Model
   (MAM) [RFC4125] is in use, then all Bandwidth Constraints (BCs) may
   be updated equally such that the total value updated is equal to the
   newly calculated SR traffic average.

   Note that the computation of the new RSVP-unreserved-bandwidth-at-
   priority-X MAY result in RSVP-TE LSPs being hard or soft preempted.
   Such preemption will be based on relative priority (e.g., low to
   high) between RSVP-TE LSPs.  The IGP-TE update threshold SHOULD allow
   for more frequent flooding of unreserved bandwidth.  From an
   operational point of view, an implementation SHOULD be able to expose
   both the configured and the actual values of the Maximum-Reservable-
   Bandwidth.

   If LSP preemption is not acceptable, then the RSVP-TE Maximum-
   Reservable-Bandwidth cannot be reduced below what is currently
   reserved by RSVP-TE on that interface.  This may result in bandwidth
   not being available for SR traffic.  Thus, it is required that any
   external controller managing SR LSPs SHOULD be able to detect this
   situation (for example, by subscribing to TED updates [RFC7752]) and
   SHOULD take action to reroute existing SR paths.

   Generically, SR traffic (or any non-RSVP-TE traffic) should have its
   own priority allocated from the available priorities.  This would
   allow SR to preempt other traffic according to the preemption
   priority order.

   In this solution, the logic to retrieve the statistics, calculating
   averages and taking action to change the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth
   is an implementation choice, and all changes are local in nature.
   However, note that this is a new network trigger for RSVP-TE
   preemption and thus is a consideration for the operator.

   The above solution offers the advantage of not introducing new
   network-wide mechanisms especially during scenarios of migrating to
   SR in an existing RSVP-TE network and reusing existing protocol
   mechanisms.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes solution options for the coexistence of RSVP-
   TE and SR LSPs in the same administrative domain.  The security
   considerations for SR are described in [RFC8402].  The security
   considerations pertaining to RSVP-TE are described in [RFC5920].  The

RFC 8426             RSVP-TE and SR LSP Coexistence            July 2018


   security considerations of each architecture are typically unaffected
   by the presence of the other.  However, when RSVP-TE and SR LSPs
   coexist, it is possible for a hijacked SR traffic stream to
   maliciously consume sufficient bandwidth and cause disruption to
   RSVP-TE LSPs.  With the solution option specified in Section 3.5, the
   impact to RSVP-TE traffic can be controlled and paths re-routed.
   Some latent risk of disruption still remains because this solution
   option relies on taking statistics samples and adopting to new
   traffic flows only after the adjustment period.  The defensive
   mechanisms described in the base SR security framework should be
   employed to guard against situations that result in SR traffic
   hijacking or denial of service.

Appendix A.  Multiplier Value Range

   The following is a suggestion for the range of values for M:

   M is a per-node positive real number that ranges from 0 to 2 with a
   default of 1 and may be expressed as a percentage.

   o  If M < 1, then the SR traffic average is being understated, which
      can result in the link getting full even though Maximum-
      Reservable-Bandwidth does not reach zero.

   o  If M > 1, then the SR traffic average is overstated, thereby
      resulting in the Maximum-Reservable-Bandwidth reaching zero before
      the link gets full.  If the reduction of Maximum-Reservable-
      Bandwidth becomes a negative value, then a value of zero SHOULD be
      used and advertised.
