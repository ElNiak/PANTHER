       464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation

Abstract

   This document describes an architecture (464XLAT) for providing
   limited IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only network by combining
   existing and well-known stateful protocol translation (as described
   in RFC 6146) in the core and stateless protocol translation (as
   described in RFC 6145) at the edge. 464XLAT is a simple and scalable
   technique to quickly deploy limited IPv4 access service to IPv6-only
   edge networks without encapsulation.

RFC 6877                         464XLAT                      April 2013


1.  Introduction

   With the exhaustion of the unallocated IPv4 address pools, it will be
   difficult for many networks to assign IPv4 addresses to end users.

   This document describes an IPv4-over-IPv6 solution as one of the
   techniques for IPv4 service extension and encouragement of IPv6
   deployment. 464XLAT is not a one-for-one replacement of full IPv4
   functionality.  The 464XLAT architecture only supports IPv4 in the
   client-server model, where the server has a global IPv4 address.
   This means it is not fit for IPv4 peer-to-peer communication or
   inbound IPv4 connections. 464XLAT builds on IPv6 transport and
   includes full any-to-any IPv6 communication.

   The 464XLAT architecture described in this document uses IPv4/IPv6
   translation standardized in [RFC6145] and [RFC6146].  It does not
   require DNS64 [RFC6147] since an IPv4 host may simply send IPv4
   packets, including packets to an IPv4 DNS server, that will be
   translated to IPv6 on the customer-side translator (CLAT) and back to
   IPv4 on the provider-side translator (PLAT).  464XLAT networks may
   use DNS64 [RFC6147] to enable single stateful translation [RFC6146]
   instead of 464XLAT double translation where possible.  The 464XLAT
   architecture encourages the IPv6 transition by making IPv4 services
   reachable across IPv6-only networks and providing IPv6 and IPv4
   connectivity to single-stack IPv4 or IPv6 servers and peers.

2.  Terminology

   PLAT:   PLAT is provider-side translator (XLAT) that complies with
           [RFC6146].  It translates N:1 global IPv6 addresses to global
           IPv4 addresses, and vice versa.

   CLAT:   CLAT is customer-side translator (XLAT) that complies with
           [RFC6145].  It algorithmically translates 1:1 private IPv4
           addresses to global IPv6 addresses, and vice versa.  The CLAT
           function is applicable to a router or an end-node such as a
           mobile phone.  The CLAT should perform IP routing and
           forwarding to facilitate packets forwarding through the
           stateless translation even if it is an end-node.  The CLAT as
           a common home router or wireless Third Generation Partnership
           Project (3GPP) router is expected to perform gateway
           functions such as being a DHCP server and DNS proxy for local
           clients.  The CLAT uses different IPv6 prefixes for CLAT-side
           and PLAT-side IPv4 addresses and therefore does not comply
           with the sentence "Both IPv4-translatable IPv6 addresses and
           IPv4-converted IPv6 addresses SHOULD use the same prefix." in

RFC 6877                         464XLAT                      April 2013


           Section 3.3 of [RFC6052].  The CLAT does not facilitate
           communications between a local IPv4-only node and an IPv6-
           only node on the Internet.

3.  Motivation and Uniqueness of 464XLAT

   The list below describes the motivation for 464XLAT and its unique
   characteristics.

   o  464XLAT has minimal IPv4 resource requirements and maximum IPv4
      efficiency through statistical multiplexing.

   o  No new protocols are required; there is quick deployment.

   o  IPv6-only networks are simpler and therefore less expensive to
      operate than dual-stack networks.

   o  464XLAT has consistent native IP-based monitoring and traffic
      engineering.  Capacity-planning techniques can be applied without
      the indirection or obfuscation of a tunnel.

4.  Network Architecture

   Examples of 464XLAT architectures are shown in the figures in the
   following sections.

   Wireline Network Architecture can be used in situations where there
   are clients behind the CLAT, regardless of the type of access service
   -- for example, fiber to the home (FTTH), Data Over Cable Service
   Interface Specification (DOCSIS), or WiFi.

   Wireless 3GPP Network Architecture can be used in situations where a
   client terminates the wireless access network and possibly acts as a
   router with tethered clients.

4.1.  Wireline Network Architecture

   The private IPv4 host in this diagram can reach global IPv4 hosts via
   translation on both the CLAT and PLAT.  On the other hand, the IPv6
   host can reach other IPv6 hosts on the Internet directly without
   translation.  This means that the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) /
   CLAT can not only have the function of a CLAT but also the function
   of an IPv6 native router for native IPv6 traffic.  In this diagram,
   the v4p host behind the CLAT has [RFC1918] addresses.

4.2.  Wireless 3GPP Network Architecture

   The CLAT function on the User Equipment (UE) provides an [RFC1918]
   address and IPv4 default route to the local node's network stack.
   The applications on the UE can use the private IPv4 address for
   reaching global IPv4 hosts via translation on both the CLAT and the
   PLAT.  On the other hand, reaching IPv6 hosts (including hosts
   presented via DNS64 [RFC6147]) does not require the CLAT function on
   the UE.

   Presenting a private IPv4 network for tethering via NAT44 and
   stateless translation on the UE is also an application of the CLAT.

5.  Applicability

5.1.  Wireline Network Applicability

   When an Internet Service Provider (ISP) has IPv6 access service and
   provides 464XLAT, the ISP can provide outgoing IPv4 service to end
   users across an IPv6 access network.  The result is that edge network
   growth is no longer tightly coupled to the availability of scarce
   IPv4 addresses.

   If another ISP operates the PLAT, the edge ISP is only required to
   deploy an IPv6 access network.  All ISPs do not need IPv4 access
   networks.  They can migrate their access network to a simple and
   highly scalable IPv6-only environment.

RFC 6877                         464XLAT                      April 2013


5.2.  Wireless 3GPP Network Applicability

   At the time of writing, in April 2013, the vast majority of mobile
   networks are compliant to Pre-Release 9 3GPP standards.  In Pre-
   Release 9 3GPP networks, Global System for Mobile Communications
   (GSM) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks
   must signal and support both IPv4 and IPv6 Packet Data Protocol (PDP)
   attachments to access IPv4 and IPv6 network destinations [RFC6459].
   Since there are two PDPs required to support two address families,
   this is double the number of PDPs required to support the status quo
   of one address family, which is IPv4.

   For the cases of connecting to an IPv4 literal or IPv4 socket that
   require IPv4 connectivity, the CLAT function on the UE provides a
   private IPv4 address and IPv4 default route on the host for the
   applications to reference and bind to.  Connections sourced from the
   IPv4 interface are immediately routed to the CLAT function and passed
   to the IPv6-only mobile network, destined for the PLAT.  In summary,
   the UE performs the CLAT function that does a stateless translation
   [RFC6145], but only when required by an IPv4-only scenario such as
   IPv4 literals or IPv4-only sockets.  The mobile network has a PLAT
   that does stateful translation [RFC6146].

   464XLAT works with today's existing systems as much as possible.
   464XLAT is compatible with existing solutions for network-based deep
   packet inspection like 3GPP standardized Policy and Charging Control
   (PCC) [TS.23203].

6.  Implementation Considerations

6.1.  IPv6 Address Format

   The IPv6 address format in 464XLAT is defined in Section 2.2 of
   [RFC6052].

6.2.  IPv4/IPv6 Address Translation Chart

   This chart offers an explanation about address translation
   architecture using a combination of stateful translation at the PLAT
   and stateless translation at the CLAT.  The client on this chart is
   delegated an IPv6 prefix from a prefix delegation mechanism such as
   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (DHCPv6-PD) [RFC3633]; therefore, it has a
   dedicated IPv6 prefix for translation.

6.3.  IPv6 Prefix Handling

   There are two relevant IPv6 prefixes that the CLAT must be aware of.

   First, CLAT must know its own IPv6 prefixes.  The CLAT should acquire
   a /64 for the uplink interface, a /64 for all downlink interfaces,
   and a dedicated /64 prefix for the purpose of sending and receiving
   statelessly translated packets.  When a dedicated /64 prefix is not
   available for translation from DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633], the CLAT may
   perform NAT44 for all IPv4 LAN packets so that all the LAN-originated
   IPv4 packets appear from a single IPv4 address and are then
   statelessly translated to one interface IPv6 address that is claimed
   by the CLAT via the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and defended
   with Duplicate Address Detection (DAD).

   Second, the CLAT must discover the PLAT-side translation IPv6 prefix
   used as a destination of the PLAT.  The CLAT will use this prefix as
   the destination of all translation packets that require stateful
   translation to the IPv4 Internet.  It may discover the PLAT-side
   translation prefix using [Discovery-Heuristic].  In the future, some
   other mechanisms, such as a new DHCPv6 option, will possibly be
   defined to communicate the PLAT-side translation prefix.

6.4.  DNS Proxy Implementation

   The CLAT should implement a DNS proxy as defined in [RFC5625].  The
   case of an IPv4-only node behind the CLAT querying an IPv4 DNS server
   is undesirable since it requires both stateful and stateless
   translation for each DNS lookup.  The CLAT should set itself as the
   DNS server via DHCP or other means and should proxy DNS queries for
   IPv4 and IPv6 LAN clients.  Using the CLAT-enabled home router or UE
   as a DNS proxy is a normal consumer gateway function and simplifies
   the traffic flow so that only IPv6 native queries are made across the
   access network.  DNS queries from the client that are not sent to the
   DNS proxy on the CLAT must be allowed and are translated and
   forwarded just like any other IP traffic.

6.5.  CLAT in a Gateway

   The CLAT feature can be implemented in a common home router or mobile
   phone that has a tethering feature.  Routers with a CLAT feature
   should also provide common router services such as DHCP of [RFC1918]
   addresses, DHCPv6, NDP with Router Advertisement, and DNS service.

6.6.  CLAT-to-CLAT Communications

   464XLAT is a hub and spoke architecture focused on enabling IPv4-only
   services over IPv6-only networks.  Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] may be used to support peer-to-peer
   communication within a 464XLAT network.

7.  Deployment Considerations

7.1.  Traffic Engineering

   Even if the ISP for end users is different from the PLAT provider
   (e.g., another ISP), it can implement traffic engineering
   independently from the PLAT provider.  Detailed reasons are below:

   1.  The ISP for end users can figure out the IPv4 destination address
       from the translated IPv6 packet header, so it can implement
       traffic engineering based on the IPv4 destination address (e.g.,
       traffic monitoring for each IPv4 destination address, packet
       filtering for each IPv4 destination address, etc.).  The
       tunneling methods do not have such an advantage, without any deep
       packet inspection for processing the inner IPv4 packet of the
       tunnel packet.

   2.  If the ISP for end users can assign an IPv6 prefix greater than
       /64 to each subscriber, this 464XLAT architecture can separate
       the IPv6 prefix for native IPv6 packets and the XLAT prefixes for
       IPv4/IPv6 translation packets.  Accordingly, it can identify the
       type of packets ("native IPv6 packets" and "IPv4/IPv6 translation
       packets") and implement traffic engineering based on the IPv6
       prefix.

7.2.  Traffic Treatment Scenarios

   The below table outlines how different permutations of connectivity
   are treated in the 464XLAT architecture.

   Note: 464XLAT double translation treatment will be stateless when a
   dedicated /64 is available for translation on the CLAT.  Otherwise,
   the CLAT will have both stateful and stateless since it requires
   NAT44 from the LAN to a single IPv4 address and then stateless
   translation to a single IPv6 address.

   To implement a PLAT, see the security considerations presented in
   Section 5 of [RFC6146].

   To implement a CLAT, see the security considerations presented in
   Section 7 of [RFC6145].  The CLAT may comply with [RFC6092].

Appendix A.  Examples of IPv4/IPv6 Address Translation

   The following is an example of IPv4/IPv6 address translation on the
   464XLAT architecture.

   In the case that an IPv6 prefix greater than /64 is assigned to an
   end user by such as DHCPv6-PD [RFC3633], the CLAT can use a dedicated
   /64 from the assigned IPv6 prefix.
