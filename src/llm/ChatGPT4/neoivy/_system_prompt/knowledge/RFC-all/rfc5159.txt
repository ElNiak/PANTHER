RFC 5159                OMA BCAST SDP Attributes              March 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Broadcast (BCAST) group is specifying
   service and content protection mechanisms for broadcast services over
   wireless networks.  As part of that specification, several new SDP
   attributes are necessary to allow the broadcast server to signal the
   service and content protection parameters to clients.

   Section 8.2.4 of RFC 4566 [1] requires that new SDP attributes are
   registered through IANA with name, contact information, and
   description (and other similar parameters).  A standards track
   specification is RECOMMENDED if the new attribute(s) will have
   widespread use and interoperability considerations.

   OMA BCAST specifications are expected to be used by broadcast
   wireless systems that are based on 3rd Generation Partnership Project
   (3GPP) Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS), 3GPP2 Broadcast
   and Multicast Services (BCMCS), and Digital Video Broadcasting -
   Handheld (DVB-H).  Although this would typically be considered a
   "widespread" use, in this case IETF chose to use a non-standards-
   track RFC to register the SDP attributes because OMA maintains change
   control of the documents that specify the interpretation of the
   values in the attributes.

   This document provides descriptions of the SDP attributes used in the
   OMA BCAST Service and Content Protection specification [2].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

3.  New SDP Attributes

   The following new SDP attributes have been specified:

   o  a=bcastversion:<major>.<minor>

   o  a=stkmstream:<id of the stkm stream>

   o  a=SRTPAuthentication:<id for SRTP authentication algorithm value>

   o  a=SRTPROCTxRate:<ROC transmission rate>

   See Section 5 for details on IANA considerations.

RFC 5159                OMA BCAST SDP Attributes              March 2008


4.  Security Considerations

   In addition to the notes in Section 7 of RFC 4566 [1], the following
   considerations may be applicable:

   The bcastversion parameter indicates the version of the broadcast
   system used for distribution of broadcast content.  In case future
   versions indicated by this parameter allow for enhanced or additional
   security features, the bcastversion parameter, if unprotected, could
   be utilized for downgrade attacks.

   The stkmstream parameter provides references to relevant key
   management streams so that receivers can map the media streams to key
   streams and retrieve the necessary keys to decrypt media.  As such,
   this parameter could be utilized, if unprotected, for denial-of-
   service (DoS) attacks.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, which follows the guidelines of [5], IANA has
   registered a number of SDP attributes.

5.1.  Registration of New SDP Attributes

   IANA has registered a number of OMA BCAST only attributes in the
   Session Description Protocol Parameters registry [1].  The
   registration data, according to RFC 4566 [1] follows.

   The registration templates below refer to the OMA-TS-
   BCAST_SvcCntProtection specification [2].

5.1.1.  Registration of the Attribute bcastversion:<major>.<minor>

   Contact:  Anja Jerichow <anja.jerichow@nsn.com>

   Phone:  +49 89 636-45868

   Attribute name:  bcastversion

   Long-form attribute name:  BCAST version

   Type of attribute:  session level

      This attribute is not dependent on charset.

RFC 5159                OMA BCAST SDP Attributes              March 2008


   Purpose:  This attribute specifies the OMA BCAST version
      "bcastversion" value in the format x.y.

   Specification of attribute values:  This attribute has a mandatory
      value of the form <major>.<minor>, where <major> and <minor> are
      non-negative decimal numbers.  The att-value field is of XML data
      type decimal.  For details, see OMA-TS-BCAST_SvcCntProtection,
      Section 10.1.1.

5.1.2.  Registration of the Attribute stkmstream:<id of the stkm stream>

   Contact:  Anja Jerichow <anja.jerichow@nsn.com>

   Phone:  +49 89 636-45868

   Attribute name:  stkmstream

   Long-form attribute name:  Short Term Key Message stream identifier

   Type of attribute:  session level or media level

      The attribute can be at session level, in which case it applies to
      all media streams, or it can be at media level, in which case it
      only applies to the specified media and would overwrite possible
      session-level attributes.

      This attribute is not dependent on charset.

   Purpose:  The stkmstream attribute specifies the mapping of Short
      Term Key Message streams to media streams in the SDP.

      Each session or media stream can have multiple stkmstream
      attributes.  By comparing the value of this attribute with the
      identifier of each STKM stream, the terminal can figure out which
      one to listen to and process.  We note that this attribute is
      optional and hence would not be there for unencrypted media
      streams.

   Specification of attribute values:  This attribute has a mandatory
      value of the form <id of the stkm stream>, a unique non-zero
      integer identifying a particular key stream.  Numbers are unique
      within a particular SDP session, i.e., no global numbering is
      required.  The att-value field is of XML data type unsignedShort.
      For details, see OMA-TS-BCAST_SvcCntProtection, Section 10.1.3.

5.1.3.  Registration of the Attribute SRTPAuthentication:<id for SRTP
        authentication algorithm value>

   Contact:  Anja Jerichow <anja.jerichow@nsn.com>

   Phone:  +49 89 636-45868

   Attribute name:  SRTPAuthentication

   Long-form attribute name:  SRTP authentication algorithm value
      identifier

   Type of attribute:  media level

      This attribute is not dependent on charset.

   Purpose:  When SRTP is used, the attribute SRTPAuthentication states
      which authentication algorithm to use.

   Specification of attribute values:  Based on [4], the identifier is a
      transform-independent parameter of the cryptographic context for
      SRTP in integer format.

      One of the following three integrity transforms registered for the
      three modes MUST be used: value "2" for RCCm1, "3" for RCCm2, and
      "4" for RCCm3.  For details, see OMA-TS-BCAST_SvcCntProtection,
      Section 10.4.

5.1.4.  Registration of the Attribute SRTPROCTxRate:<ROC transmission
        rate>

   Contact:  Anja Jerichow <anja.jerichow@nsn.com>

   Phone:  +49 89 636-45868

   Attribute name:  SRTPROCTxRate

   Long-form attribute name:  ROC transmission rate

   Type of attribute:  media level

      This attribute is not dependent on charset.

   Purpose:  When SRTP is used, the attribute SRTPROCTxRate defines the
      ROC transmission rate, R.

RFC 5159                OMA BCAST SDP Attributes              March 2008


   Specification of attribute values:  The attribute value MUST be a
      decimal integer R between 1 and 65535 inclusive, as specified in
      [4].  If the ROC transmission rate is not included in the
      negotiation, the default value of 1 SHALL be used.  For details,
      see OMA-TS-BCAST_SvcCntProtection, Section 10.4.
