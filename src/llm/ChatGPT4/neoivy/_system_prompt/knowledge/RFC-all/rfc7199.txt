        Location Configuration Extensions for Policy Management

Abstract

   Current location configuration protocols are capable of provisioning
   an Internet host with a location URI that refers to the host's
   location.  These protocols lack a mechanism for the target host to
   inspect or set the privacy rules that are applied to the URIs they
   distribute.  This document extends the current location configuration
   protocols to provide hosts with a reference to the rules that are
   applied to a URI so that the host can view or set these rules.

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


1.  Introduction

   A critical step in enabling Internet hosts to access location-based
   services is to provision those hosts with information about their own
   location.  This is accomplished via a Location Configuration Protocol
   (LCP) [RFC5687], which allows a location provider (e.g., a local
   access network) to inform a host about its location.

   There are two basic patterns for location configuration, namely
   configuration "by value" and "by reference" [RFC5808].  Configuration
   by value provisions a host directly with its location, by providing
   it location information that is directly usable (e.g., coordinates or
   a civic address).  Configuration by reference provides a host with a
   URI that references the host's location, i.e., one that can be
   dereferenced to obtain the location (by value) of the host.

   In some cases, location by reference offers a few benefits over
   location by value.  From a privacy perspective, the required
   dereference transaction provides a policy enforcement point so that
   if suitable privacy policies have been provisioned, the opaque
   location URI can be safely conveyed over untrusted media.  (If the
   location URI is not subject to privacy rules, then conveying the
   location URI may pose even greater risk than sending location by
   value [RFC5606].)  If the target host is mobile, an application
   provider can use a single reference to obtain the location of the
   host multiple times, saving bandwidth to the host.  For some
   configuration protocols, the location object referenced by a location
   URI provides a much more expressive syntax for location values than
   the configuration protocol itself (e.g., DHCP geodetic location
   [RFC6225] versus Geography Markup Language (GML) in a Presence
   Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) [RFC4119]).

   From a privacy perspective, however, current LCPs are limited in
   their flexibility, in that they do not provide hosts (the clients in
   an LCP) with a way to inform the Location Server with policy for how
   his location information should be handled.  This document addresses
   this gap by defining a simple mechanism for referring to and
   manipulating policy and by extending current LCPs to carry policy
   references.  Using the mechanisms defined in this document, an LCP
   server (acting for the Location Server (LS) or Location Information
   Server (LIS)) can inform a host as to which policy document controls
   a given location resource, and the host (in its Rule Maker role) can
   inspect this document and modify it as necessary.

   In the following figure, adapted from RFC 5808, this document extends
   the Location Configuration Protocols (1) and defines a simple
   protocol for policy exchange (4).

   The remainder of this document is structured as follows:

   After introducing a few relevant terms, we define policy URIs as a
   channel for referencing, inspecting, and updating policy documents.
   We then define an extension to the HELD protocol to allow it to carry
   policy URIs.  Examples are given that demonstrate how policy URIs are
   carried in this protocol and how it can be used by clients.

2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Policy URIs

   A policy URI is an HTTP [RFC2616] or HTTPS [RFC2818] URI that
   identifies a policy resource that contains the authorization policy
   for a linked location resource.  Access to the location resource is
   governed by the contents of the authorization policy.

   A policy URI identifies an HTTP resource that a Rule Maker can use to
   inspect and install policy documents that tell a Location Server how
   it should protect the associated location resource.  A policy URI
   always identifies a resource that can be represented as a common-
   policy document [RFC4745] (possibly including some extensions; e.g.,
   for geolocation policy [RFC6772]).

   Note:  RFC 3693 [RFC3693] identified the Rule Holder role as the one
      that stores policy information.  In this document, the Location
      Server is also a Rule Holder.

3.1.  Policy URI Usage

   A Location Server that is the authority for policy URIs MUST support
   GET, PUT, and DELETE requests to these URIs, in order to allow
   clients to inspect, replace, and delete policy documents.  Clients
   support the three request methods as they desire to perform these
   operations.

   Knowledge of the policy URI can be considered adequate evidence of
   authorization; a policy URI functions as a shared secret between the
   client and the server (see Section 7).  A Location Server SHOULD
   allow all requests, but it MAY deny certain requests based on local
   policy.  For instance, a Location Server might allow clients to
   inspect policy (GET), but not to update it (PUT).  Or, a Location
   Server might require clients to authenticate using HTTP or Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) client authentication.  Clients implementing
   this specification SHOULD support HTTP client authentication
   [RFC2617] and MAY support TLS client certificates.

   A GET request to a policy URI is a request for the referenced policy
   information.  If the request is authorized, then the Location Server
   sends an HTTP 200 response containing the complete policy identified
   by the URI.

   A PUT request to a policy URI is a request to replace the current
   policy.  The entity-body of a PUT request includes a complete policy
   document.  When a Location Server receives a PUT request, it MUST
   validate the policy document included in the body of the request.  If
   the request is valid and authorized, then the Location Server MUST
   replace the current policy with the policy provided in the request.

   A DELETE request to a policy URI is a request to delete the
   referenced policy document.  If the request is authorized, then the
   Location Server MUST delete the policy referenced by the URI and
   disallow access to the location URIs it governs until a new policy
   document has been put in place via a PUT request.

   A policy URI is only valid while the corresponding location URI set
   is valid.  A Location Server MUST NOT respond to any requests to a
   policy URI once the corresponding location URI set has expired.  This
   expiry time is specified by the 'expires' attribute in the HELD
   locationResponse.





Barnes, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


      A location URI can thus become invalid in three ways: By the
      expiration of a validity interval in policy, by the removal of a
      policy document with a DELETE request, or by the expiry of the
      LCP-specified validity interval.  The former two are temporary,
      since the policy URI can be used to update the policy.  The latter
      one is permanent, since the expiry causes the policy URI to be
      invalidated as well.

   The Location Server MUST support policy documents in the common-
   policy format [RFC4745], as identified by the MIME media type of
   "application/auth-policy+xml".  The common-policy format MUST be
   provided as the default format in response to GET requests that do
   not include specific "Accept" headers, but content negotiation MAY be
   used to allow for other formats.

   This usage of HTTP is generally compatible with the use of Extensible
   Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) [RFC4825]
   or Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) [RFC4918] to
   manage policy documents, but this document does not define or require
   the use of these protocols.

3.2.  Policy URI Allocation

   A Location Server creates a policy URI for a specific location
   resource at the time that the location resource is created; that is,
   a policy URI is created at the same time as the location URI that it
   controls.  The URI of the policy resource MUST be different from the
   location URI.

   A policy URI is provided in response to location configuration
   requests.  A policy URI MUST NOT be provided to an entity that is not
   authorized to view or set policy.  This document does not describe
   how policy might be provided to entities other than for location
   configuration, for example, in responses to dereferencing requests
   [RFC6753] or requests from third parties [RFC6155].

   Each location URI has either one policy URI or no policy URI.  The
   initial policy that is referenced by a policy URI MUST be identical
   to the policy that would be applied in the absence of a policy URI.
   A client that does not support policy URIs can continue to use the
   location URI as they would have if no policy URI were provided.

      For HELD, the client assumes that the default policy grants any
      requester access to location information, as long as the request
      possesses the location URI.  To ensure that the authorization
      policy is less permissive, a client updates the policy prior to
      distributing the location URI.




Barnes, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


   A Location Server chooses whether or not to provide a policy URI
   based on local policy.  A HELD-specific extension also allows a
   requester to specifically ask for a policy URI.

   A policy URI is effectively a shared secret between the Location
   Server and its clients.  Knowledge of a policy URI is all that is
   required to perform any operations allowed on the policy.  Thus, a
   policy URI should be constructed so that it is hard to predict and
   confidentiality protected when transmitted (see Section 7).  To avoid
   reusing these shared secrets, the Location Server MUST generate a new
   policy URI whenever it generates a new location URI set.

3.3.  Policy Defaults

   Client implementors should keep in mind that setting no policy (never
   performing an HTTP request to a policy URI) is very different from
   setting an empty policy (performing a PUT with the empty policy).  By
   "the empty policy", we mean a policy containing no rules, which would
   be represented by the following policy document:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
      <ruleset xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:common-policy">
      </ruleset>

                        Figure 1: The Empty Policy

   If no policy is set, then the client tacitly accepts whatever policy
   the server applies to location URIs, including a policy that provides
   location to anyone that makes a dereference request.  If the empty
   policy is set, then the opposite is true; the client directs the
   server to never provide access to location.  (Since there are no
   rules to allow access and the policy language is default-deny.)

   Thus, implementors should consider carefully how to handle the case
   where the user provides no privacy policy input.  On the one hand, an
   implementation might treat this case as if the user had no privacy
   preferences and, thus, set no policy.  On the other hand, another
   implementation might decide that if a user provides no positive
   authorization, then the empty policy should be installed.

   The same reasoning could also be applied to servers, with the caveat
   that servers do not know whether a given HELD client supports the use
   of policy URIs.  A client that does not understand policy URIs will
   not be able to set its own policy, so the server must choose a
   default that is open enough that clients will find it useful.  On the
   other hand, once a client indicates that it understands policy URIs
   (by including a "requestPolicyUri" element in its HELD request), the




Barnes, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


   server may change its default policy to something more restrictive --
   even the empty, default-deny policy -- since the client can specify
   something more permissive if desired.

4.  Location Configuration Extensions

   Location configuration protocols can provision hosts with location
   URIs that refer to the host's location.  If the target host is to
   control policy on these URIs, it needs a way to access the policy
   that the Location Server uses to guide how it serves location URIs.
   This section defines extensions to LCPs to carry policy URIs that the
   target can use to control access to location resources.

4.1.  HELD

   The HELD protocol [RFC5985] defines a "locationUriSet" element, which
   contains a set of one or more location URIs that reference the same
   resource and share a common access control policy.  The schema in
   Figure 2 defines two extension elements for HELD: an empty
   "requestPolicyUri" element that is added to a location request to
   indicate that a Device desires that a policy URI be allocated and a
   "policyUri" element that is included in the location response.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <xs:schema
        targetNamespace="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy"
        xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
        xmlns:hp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy"
        elementFormDefault="qualified"
        attributeFormDefault="unqualified">

     <xs:element name="requestPolicyUri">
       <xs:complexType name="empty"/>
     </xs:element>

     <xs:element name="policyUri" type="xs:anyURI"/>

   </xs:schema>

             Figure 2: XML Schema for the Policy URI Extension

   The URI carried in a "policyUri" element refers to the common access
   control policy for location URIs in the location response.  The URI
   MUST be a policy URI as described in Section 3.  A policy URI MUST
   use the "http:" or "https:" scheme, and the Location Server MUST
   support the specified operations on the URI.





Barnes, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 8]

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


   A HELD request MAY contain an explicit request for a policy URI.  The
   presence of the "requestPolicyUri" element in a location request
   indicates that a policy URI is desired.

4.2.  Client Processing

   It is possible that this document will be updated to allow the use of
   policy URIs that use protocols other than the HTTP-based protocol
   described above.  To ensure that they fail safely when presented with
   such a URI, clients implementing this specification MUST verify that
   a policy URI received from HELD uses either the "http:" or "https:"
   scheme.  If the URI does not match those schemes, then the client
   MUST discard the URI and behave as if no policy URI was provided.

5.  Examples

   In this section, we provide some brief illustrations of how policy
   URIs are delivered to target hosts and used by those hosts to manage
   policy.

   A HELD request that explicitly requests the creation of a policy URI
   has the following form:

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
     <locationType exact="true">locationURI</locationType>
     <requestPolicyUri
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy"/>
   </locationRequest>

   A HELD response providing a single "locationUriSet", containing two
   URIs under a common policy, would have the following form:

   <locationResponse xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held">
     <locationUriSet expires="2011-01-01T13:00:00.0Z">
       <locationURI>
         https://ls.example.com:9768/357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o
       </locationURI>
       <locationURI>
         sip:9769+357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o@ls.example.com:
       </locationURI>
     </locationUriSet>
     <policyUri xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:policy">
       https://ls.example.com:9768/policy/357lp6f64prlbvhl5nk3b
     </policyUri>
   </locationResponse>

5.1.  Basic Access Control Policy

   Consider a client that gets the policy URI <https://
   ls.example.com:9768/policy/357lp6f64prlbvhl5nk3b>, as in the above
   LCP example.  The first thing this allows the client to do is inspect
   the default policy that the LS has assigned to this URI:

   GET /policy/357lp6f64prlbvhl5nk3b HTTP/1.1
   Host: ls.example.com:9768

   This policy allows any requester to obtain location information, as
   long as they know the location URI.  If the user disagrees with this
   policy, and prefers for example, to only provide location to one
   friend, at a city level of granularity, then the client can install
   this policy on the Location Server:

7.  Security Considerations

   There are two main classes of risks associated with access control
   policy management: The risk of unauthorized grants or denial of
   access to the protected resource via manipulation of the policy
   management process, and the risk of disclosure of policy information
   itself.

   Protecting the policy management process from manipulation entails
   two primary requirements.  First, the policy URI has to be faithfully
   and confidentially transmitted to the client; second, the policy
   document has to be faithfully and confidentially transmitted to the
   Location Server.  The mechanism also needs to ensure that only
   authorized entities are able to acquire or alter policy.

7.1.  Integrity and Confidentiality for Authorization Policy Data

   Each LCP ensures integrity and confidentiality through different
   means (see [RFC5985]).  These measures ensure that a policy URI is
   conveyed to the client without modification or interception.

   In general, the requirements for TLS on policy transactions are the
   same as for the dereference transactions they set policy for
   [RFC6753].  To protect the integrity and confidentiality of policy
   data during management, the Location Server SHOULD provide policy
   URIs with the "https:" scheme and require the use of HTTP over TLS
   [RFC2818].  The cipher suites required by TLS [RFC5246] provide both
   integrity protection and confidentiality.  If other means of
   protection are available, an "http:" URI MAY be used, but location
   servers SHOULD reject PUT and DELETE requests for policy URIs that
   use the "http:" URI scheme.

7.2.  Access Control for Authorization Policy

   Access control for the policy resource is based on knowledge of its
   URI.  The URI of a policy resource operates under the same
   constraints as a possession model location URI [RFC5808] and is
   subject to the same constraints:

   o  Knowledge of a policy URI MUST be restricted to authorized Rule
      Makers.  Confidentiality and integrity protections SHOULD be used
      when policy URIs are conveyed in a location configuration protocol
      and in the requests that are used to inspect, change, or delete
      the policy resource.  Note that in some protocols (such as DHCP),
      these protections may arise from limiting the use of the protocol
      to the local network thus relying on lower-layer security





Barnes, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 13]

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


      mechanisms.  When neither application-layer nor network-layer
      security is provided, location servers MUST reject requests using
      the PUT and DELETE methods.

   o  The Location Server MUST ensure that it is not practical for an
      attacker to guess a policy URI value, even if the attacker has
      requested many policy URIs from the Location Server over time.
      The policy URI MUST NOT be derived solely from information that
      might be public, including the Target identity or any location
      URI.  The addition of 128 bits or more of random entropy is
      RECOMMENDED to make it infeasible for a third party to guess a
      policy URI.

   o  Servers SHOULD apply rate limits in order to make brute-force
      guessing infeasible.  If a server allocates location URIs that
      include N bits of entropy with a lifetime of T seconds, then the
      server should limit clients to (2^(N/2))/T queries per second.
      (The lifetime T of a location URI set is specified by the
      "expires" attribute in HELD.)

   One possible algorithm for generating appropriately unpredictable
   policy URIs for a location URI set is described in Appendix A.

   The goal of the above recommendation on rate limiting is to bound the
   probability that an attacker can guess a policy URI during its
   lifetime.  If an attacker is limited to (2^(N/2))/T queries per
   second, then he will be able to make at most 2^(N/2) guesses over the
   lifetime of the URI.  Assuming these guesses are distinct, the
   probability of the attacker guessing any given URI is
   (2^(N/2))/(2^N), so the probability of compromise over the T-second
   lifetime of the URI is at most 2^(-N/2).  (Of course, if the attacker
   guesses the URI after the policy URI has expired, then there is no
   risk.)  With N=128, the probability of compromise is 5.4e-20 under
   this rate-limiting scheme.  Operators should choose values for N so
   that the corresponding risk of compromise presents an acceptable
   level of risk.

   If M distinct URIs are issued within the same namespace, then the
   probability of any of the M URIs being compromised is M*2^(N/2).  The
   example algorithm for generating policy URIs (see Appendix A) places
   them in independent namespaces (i.e., below the corresponding
   location URIs), so this compounding does not occur.

   Note that the chosen entropy level will also affect how quickly
   legitimate clients can query a given URI, especially for very long-
   lived URIs.  If the default lifetime T is greater than 2^(N/2), then
   clients will have to wait multiple seconds between queries.
   Operators should choose entropy and lifetime values that result in



Barnes, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 14]

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


   acceptable high maximum query rates and acceptably low probability of
   compromise.  For example, with 32 bits of entropy (much less than
   recommended above), the one-query-per-second policy URI lifetime is
   around 18 hours.

7.3.  Location URI Allocation

   A policy URI enables the authorization by access control lists model
   [RFC5808] for associated location URIs.  Under this model, it might
   be possible to more widely distribute a location URI, relying on the
   authorization policy to constrain access to location information.

   To allow for wider distribution, authorization by access control
   lists places additional constraints on the construction of location
   URIs.

   If multiple Targets share a location URI, an unauthorized location
   recipient that acquires location URIs for the Targets can determine
   that the Targets are at the same location by comparing location URIs.
   With shared policy URIs, Targets are able to see and modify
   authorization policy for other Targets.

   To allow for the creation of Target-specific authorization policies
   that are adequately privacy protected, each location URI and policy
   URI that is issued to a different Target MUST be different from other
   location URIs and policy URIs.  That is, two clients MUST NOT receive
   the same location URI or the same policy URI.

   In some deployments, it is not always apparent to an LCP server that
   two clients are different.  In particular, where a middlebox
   [RFC3234] exists, two or more clients might appear as a single
   client.  An example of a deployment scenario of this nature is
   described in [RFC5687].  An LCP server MUST create a different
   location URI and policy URI for every request, unless the requests
   can be reliably identified as being from the same client.

7.4.  Policy URI Handling

   Although servers may choose to implement access controls on policy
   URIs, by default, any holder of a policy URI is authorized to access
   and modify the referenced policy document and, thus, to control
   access to the associated location resources.  Because policy URIs
   function as shared secrets, clients SHOULD protect them as they would
   passwords.  For example, policy URIs SHOULD NOT be transmitted to
   other hosts or stored in plaintext.






Barnes, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 15]

RFC 7199                     LCP Policy URIs                  April 2014


   It should be noted that one of the benefits of the policy URI
   construct is that in most cases, there is not a policy URI to leave
   the client device to which it is provided.  Without policy URIs,
   location URIs are subject to a default policy set unilaterally by the
   server, and location URIs must be conveyed to another entity in order
   to be useful.  With policy URIs, location URIs can have more nuanced
   access controls, and the shared secret used to authenticate the
   client (i.e., the policy URI) can simply be stored on the client and
   used to set the access control policy on the location URI.  So while
   policy URIs do use a default model of authorization by possession,
   they reduce the overall risk to location privacy posed by leakage of
   shared secret URIs.

Appendix A.  Example Policy URI Generation Algorithm

   One possible algorithm for generating appropriately unpredictable
   policy URIs for a location URI set is as follows:

   1.  Choose parameters:

       *  A cryptographic hash function H, e.g., SHA256

       *  A number N of bits of entropy to add, such that N is no more
          than the length of the output of the hash function

   2.  On allocation of a location URI, generate a policy URI in the
       following way:

       1.  Generate a random value NONCE at least N/8 bytes long

       2.  Compute hash = H( Location-URI-Set || NONCE ) using some
           cryptographic hash function H and some serialization of the
           location URI set (e.g., the XML from a HELD response)

       3.  Form the policy URI by appending the base64url-encoded form
           of the hash [RFC4648] to one of the location URIs, e.g., as a
           query parameter: "http://example.com/loc/
           foo?policy=j3WTGUb3smxcZA6eKIqmqdV3ALE"
