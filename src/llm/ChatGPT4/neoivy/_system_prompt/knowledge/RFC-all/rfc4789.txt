RFC 4789                   SNMP over IEEE 802              November 2006


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies how Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   messages can be transmitted directly over IEEE 802 networks.  For a
   detailed overview of the documents that describe the Internet-
   Standard management framework, please refer to section 7 of RFC 3410
   [RFC3410].  This document supplements the standard SNMP transport
   mappings defined in RFC 3417 [RFC3417].

   This document obsoletes RFC 1089.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  SNMP over IEEE 802 Networks

   This is an optional transport mapping.  The need to carry SNMP
   directly over an 802 LAN transport in order to allow for the
   management of simple devices was identified in applications like the
   Two-Port Media Access Control (MAC) Relay, which is being developed
   in IEEE 802.1 as project P802.1aj [802.1aj].

   SNMP over IEEE 802 networks has some inherent restrictions.  Using
   the SNMP over IEEE 802 transport mapping restricts messages to a
   single logical IEEE 802 LAN, bridged LAN or VLAN.  Furthermore, only
   a single SNMP engine can be addressed on a given IEEE 802 network
   interface.  In particular, command generators and notification
   receivers, as well as command responders and notification
   originators, must share a single transport endpoint.

3.1.  Serialization

   SNMP messages are serialized, as described in Section 8 of RFC 3417
   [RFC3417].  The resulting serialized message is shipped in the data
   portion of an IEEE LAN MAC frame.

3.2.  Well-known Values

   Serialized SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3 frames with an
   Ethernet type field of 33100 (hexadecimal 814C).

   When serialized SNMP messages are sent in IEEE 802.3 frames (and in
   other IEEE 802 MAC frame types that can natively represent Ethernet
   type values), an Ethernet type field value of 33100 (hexadecimal
   814C) MUST be used as the link layer protocol identifier.  In IEEE
   802 LANs that use LLC as the means of link layer protocol
   identification, such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs, the SNAP
   encapsulation method described in subclause 10.5 "Encapsulation of
   Ethernet frames over LLC" in [IEEE802] MUST be used.

   When an SNMP entity uses this transport mapping, it MUST be capable
   of accepting SNMP messages up to and including 484 octets in size.
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations be capable of accepting
   messages of up to 1472 octets in size.  Implementation of larger
   values is encouraged whenever possible.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   Several core SNMP MIB modules use TDomain/TAddress pairs to identify
   SNMP transport endpoints.  The SNMP-TARGET-MIB [RFC3413] uses
   TDomain/TAddress pairs to identify targets that can be used as
   notification receivers.  TDomain/TAddress pairs are used by the
   NOTIFICATION-LOG-MIB [RFC3014] to record the source from which a
   notification was received.  The ENTITY-MIB [RFC4133] uses TDomain/
   TAddress pairs to provide the transport endpoint of logical entities.

   The MIB module contained in this document introduces the object
   identifier constant snmpIeee802Domain.  This constant can be assigned
   to an object of type TDomain to identify an SNMP over IEEE 802
   endpoint, in which case the corresponding TAddress will have a value
   that conforms to the MacAddress textual convention.  By providing
   these definitions, it is possible to use the generic MIB modules to
   refer to SNMP over IEEE 802 endpoints.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA made a MIB OID assignment under the snmpModules branch for the
   SNMP-IEEE802-TM-MIB module.

   IANA assigned an OID value below snmpDomains for the transport
   domain.  This first required the setup of a registry for OIDs under
   snmpDomains.  At the point of this writing, the following assignments
   already exist:

     Prefix: iso.org.dod.internet.snmpv2.snmpDomains (1.3.6.1.6.1)

     Decimal   Name                Description          References
     -------   ----                -----------          ----------
          1    snmpUDPDomain       SNMP over UDP         [RFC3417]
          2    snmpCLNSDomain      SNMP over CLNS        [RFC3417]
          3    snmpCONSDomain      SNMP over CONS        [RFC3417]
          4    snmpDDPDomain       SNMP over DDP         [RFC3417]
          5    snmpIPXDomain       SNMP over IPX         [RFC3417]

   The following assigment has been made:

     Decimal   Name                Description          References
     -------   ----                -----------          ----------
          6    snmpIeee802Domain   SNMP over IEEE 802    RFC 4789

   For new assignments, a specification is required as per [RFC2434].

6.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines an OBJECT-IDENTIFIER which may be used by other MIB modules
   to identify an SNMP transport mapping.  Meaningful security
   considerations can only be written in the MIB modules that define
   management objects.  The MIB module in this document has therefore no
   impact on the security of the Internet.

   SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c messages are not considered secure.  It is
   recommended that the implementors consider the use of SNMPv3 messages
   and the security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.
   Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model STD 62, RFC
   3414 [RFC3414] and the View-based Access Control Model STD 62, RFC
   3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to a MIB is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change) them.

   The original SNMP over Ethernet definition was written by Marty
   Schoffstall, Chuck Davin, Mark Fedor, and Jeff Case, and published as
   RFC 1089 [RFC1089].

   Bert Wijnen and Dan Romascanu provided guidance on many aspects of
   this revised specification.  David Harrington provided useful
