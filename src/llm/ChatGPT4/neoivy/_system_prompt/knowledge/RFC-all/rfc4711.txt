1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it extends [RFC2819] with managed objects used for
   real-time application QoS monitoring.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  RAQMON Framework

   As outlined in [RFC4710], the RAQMON framework is based on three
   entities:

      - RAQMON Data Source (RDS)

      - RAQMON Report Collector (RRC)

      - RAQMON MIB Structure

   The RAQMON MIB describes information passed between RRCs and a RAQMON
   Application ("RAQMON manager").

4.  Structure of the RAQMON MIB

   The RAQMON MIB module is composed of three MIB groups:
   raqmonSession, raqmonException, and raqmonConfig.

   The raqmonSession MIB group incorporates the following tables:





Siddiqui, et al.            Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 4711                       RAQMON MIB                   October 2006


      - The raqmonParticpantTable contains information about
        participants in open and closed (terminated) sessions, including
        parameters of the sessions they are involved in, aggregated
        since the beginning of the session.

      - The raqmonQosTable contains historical information about QoS
        during sessions.  The set of parameters represented in this
        table is more restricted, but it includes historical per-
        RAQMON-report information.

      - The raqmonParticpantAddrTable maps participant addresses into
        the indices of the raqmonParticpantTable.  This table allows
        management applications to find entries sorted by
        raqmonParticipantAddr rather than raqmonParticipantStartDate.

   The raqmonException MIB group includes a table of filters that
   trigger notifications for sessions with poor QoS.

   The raqmonConfig MIB group includes objects that define the
   configuration of the RAQMON Report Collector.

   This MIB module MUST be implemented by RAQMON Report Collectors.

   A separate MIB module is defined in [RFC4712] for mapping the RAQMON
   PDUs onto an SNMP transport.  The MIB module defined in [RFC4712] is
   normally implemented by RAQMON Data Sources (RDS).

5.  RAQMON MIB Definitions

   The MIB module herein IMPORTS definitions from the following:
         SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578]
         SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579]
         SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580]
         RMON-MIB [RFC2819]
         SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411]
         INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001]

   It also uses REFERENCE clauses to refer to [RFC4710].

   It also mentions [RFC3737] with respect to the MODULE-IDENTITY OID
   allocation.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Setting the value of the object raqmonRDSTimeout to too low a value
   would result in RDS sessions being terminated sooner than necessary,
   while setting at too high a value may result in terminated sessions
   continuing to be managed, with unnecessary memory allocations.



Siddiqui, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 33]

RFC 4711                       RAQMON MIB                   October 2006


   Setting the following object to incorrect values can result in the
   collectors either flooding the management applications with
   unnecessary notifications, or not sending notifications when the QoS
   in the network may be degraded.

      raqmonSessionExceptionIAJitterThreshold
      raqmonSessionExceptionRTTThreshold
      raqmonSessionExceptionLostPacketsThreshold

   Setting the raqmonConfigPort object to incorrect values can result in
   the collector not being able to receive RAQMON PDUs from the data
   sources.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  These are:

      raqmonParticipantTable
      raqmonQoSTable
      raqmonParticpantAddrTable

   Unauthorized exposure of these objects may lead to disclosure of the
   addresses of the participants in applications, or information about
   the traffic patents of the applications, which may be considered
   sensitive in certain environments.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt their values when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.

   The structure of the RAQMON tables limits what can be usefully done
   for access control configuration using View-based Access Control
   Model (VACM).  For example, with these structures it would not be
   possible to provide a group, with access to performance data for a
   specific group of devices, since the index values for
   raqmonParticpantEntry cannot be known in advance. Likewise,
   raqmonSessionExceptionEntries apply to all entries in the
   raqmonQoSTable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.







Siddiqui, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 34]

RFC 4711                       RAQMON MIB                   October 2006


   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   No requirements from IANA are defined in this document.  The root OID
   of the MIB module defined in this document belongs to the RMON
   subtree, as reserved in [RFC3737].
