Abstract

   From time to time, the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) publishes
   documents as Requests for Comments (RFCs).  This document defines the
   process by which those documents are produced, reviewed, and
   published in the RFC Series.

RFC 4845              IAB RFC Publication Process              July 2007


1.  Introduction

   From time to time, the IAB has cause to publish documents as Requests
   for Comments (RFCs).  These occasions include the following:

   o  documents that arise from consideration of an issue by the IAB and
      are authored by the IAB through a nominated editor.

   o  documents that report on IAB activities, such as workshop reports,
      and are authored by a nominated editor, generally from among the
      activity participants.

   o  documents that are not the outcome of an Internet Engineering Task
      Force (IETF) Working Group effort but that the IAB has determined
      would be of benefit to the IETF community to publish.  Such
      documents need not necessarily be authored or revised by the IAB.

   The majority of documents published by the IAB will be classified as
   Informational RFCs (see [RFC2026]).  Generally speaking, the IAB does
   not publish Standards-Track or Experimental RFCs.  If the IAB has
   cause to publish a document as a Best Current Practice (BCP), it
   would fall under the approval process of the IETF standards stream of
   RFCs (see [RFC4844]).

2.  Review and Approval

   In many cases, the IAB publishes documents to provide a permanent
   record of an IAB statement or position.  In such cases, the IAB uses
   its internal discussion processes to refine the expression and
   technical content of the document, and the document is approved for
   publication if, and only if, the IAB is in agreement on its
   substantive content.

   For certain documents, it may not be appropriate for the IAB to take
   responsibility for technical correctness.  For example, where the IAB
   has sponsored a workshop in which not all the participants were
   members of the IAB and/or not all the members of the IAB were
   present, approval by the IAB of a report of the workshop is used only
   to assert that the report is a faithful report of the proceedings of
   the workshop and that the matter is of interest to the community.

   Documents for which the IAB takes responsibility for technical
   correctness (the most usual case) will be indicated by noting the IAB
   as an author of the document, with individuals noted as editors or
   text authors.  Other documents, such as workshop reports, will not
   specify the IAB as an author (although this does not preclude
   individual IAB members from being authors or editors).

RFC 4845              IAB RFC Publication Process              July 2007


   In general, the document (introductory) text should make plain the
   role of the IAB in publishing and supporting the text.  Should the
   IAB have significant issues with any individual item in the document,
   a note may be included in the document explaining the issue.

3.  IAB RFC Publication Process

   The following is a description of the process used by the IAB to
   publish IAB documents as RFCs.

   1.  The document is determined to be an IAB document by the IAB, as
       described in Section 1.

   2.  The IAB publishes an IAB draft (draft-iab-*).  Comments on the
       draft are reviewed and may be integrated into successive
       iterations of the draft.  In addition to considering comments
       received on the draft, the IAB may elect to refer the document to
       individuals or groups and explicitly solicit comments as
       appropriate.

   3.  For documents intended to be published as BCPs, the document is
       passed to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) with a
       sponsoring Area Director (AD), and follows the process outlined
       in [SPONSOR].

   4.  For documents intended to be Informational RFCs, the remainder of
       this process is followed.

   5.  The chair of the IAB issues an IETF-wide Call for Comment on the
       IETF Announce mailing list.  The comment period is normally no
       shorter than four weeks.

   6.  Comments received are considered for integration into the
       document.  The IAB shall determine whether the document is ready
       for publication based on the comments received, or whether
       another round of document editing and, optionally, a further call
       for input is required.

   7.  The document is passed to the RFC Editor for publication as an
       IAB document Informational RFC.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not discuss matters with any particular security
   implications.
