1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over
   Cable Service Interface Specification process.

2.1.  Baseline Privacy

   Security interface specification, designed for DOCSIS-compliant cable
   data systems, that ensures device authentication data confidentiality
   in the CATV plant.  See [BPI] and [BPIPLUS].

2.2.  CATV

   Originally "Community Antenna Television", it now refers to any cable
   or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals to a
   community.

2.3.  Channel

   A specific frequency allocation with an RF medium, specified by
   channel width in Hertz (cycles per second) and by center frequency.
   Within the US Cable Systems, upstream channels are generally
   allocated from the 5-42MHz range while downstream channels are
   generally allocated from the 50-750MHz range, depending on the
   capabilities of the given system.  The typical broadcast channel
   width in the US is 6MHz.  Upstream channel widths for DOCSIS vary.

   For European cable systems, upstream channels vary by country.  The
   upper edge of upstream channel allocations varies between 25 MHz to
   65 MHz, and the lower edge of downstream channel allocations varies
   between 47 MHz and 87.5 MHz.  The typical broadcast channel width in
   Europe is 8MHz.  The actual parameters are of concern to systems
   deploying Euro-DOCSIS technology.

   The downstream channels conform to the requirements of ITU-T
   Recommendation J.83 [ITU-T_J.83]

2.4.  CM or Cable Modem

   A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS-compliant cable data
   system.

2.5.  CMTS or Cable Modem Termination System

   A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head-end.
   A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS-compliant cable data
   system.  It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it

RFC 4546          DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB         June 2006


   controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated
   CMs.

2.6.  Codeword

   A characteristic of the Forward Error Correction scheme, used above
   the RF media layer.

   See "Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications: Radio
   Frequency Interface Specification SP-RFIv2.0-I10-051209".

2.7.  Data Packet

   The payload portion of the MAC Packet.

2.8.  dBmV

   A measure of RF signal voltage amplitude, whose power level is
   determined by the characteristic impedance.  A zero dB signal power
   is equivalent to 48.75 dBmV signal amplitude in a 75 Ohm system.

2.9.  DOCSIS

   "Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification".  A term referring
   to the ITU-T J112 [ITU-T_J.112] Annex B standard for cable modem
   systems.

2.9.1.  DOCSIS 1.0

   Cable modem systems that are CM/CMTS compliant to requirements in
   [RFI1.0].  A common reference to DOCSIS 1.0 in this document is the
   upstream channel queuing mechanism, known as Class of Service (COS).

2.9.2.  DOCSIS 1.1

   Cable modem systems that are CM/CMTS compliant to requirements in
   [ITU-T_J.112].  DOCSIS 1.1 references in this document are in part
   associated with the upstream and downstream Quality of Service (QOS).
   The term DOCSIS 1.x is used in this document to refer to both DOCSIS
   1.0 and DOCSIS 1.1.

2.9.3.  DOCSIS 2.0

   Cable modem systems that are CM/CMTS compliant to requirements in
   [ITU-T_J.122].  DOCSIS 2.0 corresponds to the second generation of
   radio-frequency interface specifications of DOCSIS.

   "Multimedia Cable Network System".  Generally replaced in usage by
   DOCSIS.

2.15.  Mini-slot

   In general, an interval of time that is allocated by the CMTS to a
   given CM for that CM to transmit in an upstream direction.  See
   [ITU-T_J.122]

2.16.  QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)

   A particular modulation scheme on an RF medium.  See [Proakis00].

2.17.  QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)

3.  Overview

   This MIB module provides a set of objects required for the management
   of DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination
   System (CMTS) RF interfaces.  The specification is derived in part
   from the parameters and protocols described in [ITU-T_J.122].

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.1.  Textual Conventions

   This MIB module defines new textual conventions for CM and CMTS
   indications of DOCSIS 2.0 RFI capabilities, configuration, usage, and
   backward compatible modes of operation, as defined in [RFI2.0].  With
   the same purpose, there are some textual conventions that represent
   capabilities and modes of operation of [RFI1.1] that are not covered
   by RFC 2670, and are managed proprietarily in the DOCSIS OSSI 1.1
   specification [OSSI1.1].

3.1.1.  Textual Conventions in RFC 2670

   RFC 2670 defined two textual conventions, TenthdBmV and TenthdB,
   which are power measurement representations.

3.1.2.  Textual Conventions in RFC 4546

   This MIB module defines the textual convention DocsisUpstreamType to
   represent the DOCSIS 1.0 [RFI1.0] and DOCSIS 2.0 [RFI2.0] upstream
   burst modulation profiles types.

   This MIB module defines the textual conventions DocsisVersion and
   DocsisQosVersion to represent the DOCSIS 1.0 [RFI1.0] and DOCSIS 1.1
   [RFI1.1] COS/QOS capabilities and modes of operation.

3.2.  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB module is structured as three groups:

   o  Management information pertinent to both Cable Modem (CM) and
      Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) (docsIfBaseObjects).





Raftus & Cardona            Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 4546          DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB         June 2006


   o  Management information pertinent to Cable Modem only
      (docsIfCmObjects).

   o  Management information pertinent to Cable Modem Termination System
      only (docsIfCmtsObjects).

   Tables within each of these groups cover different functions; e.g.,
   upstream queue services, channel characteristics, MAC layer
   management, etc.  Rows created automatically (e.g., by the device
   according to the hardware configuration) may and generally will have
   a mixture of configuration and status objects within them.  Rows that
   are meant to be created by the management station are generally
   restricted to configuration (read-create) objects.

3.2.1.  docsIfBaseObjects

   docsIfDownstreamChannelTable - This table describes the existing
   downstream channels for a CMTS and the received downstream channel
   for a CM.

   docsIfUpstreamChannelTable - This table describes the existing
   upstream channels for a CMTS and the current upstream transmission
   channel for a CM.

   docsIfQosProfileTable - This table describes the valid Quality of
   Service profiles for the cable data system.

   docsIfSignalQualityTable - This table is used to monitor RF signal
   quality characteristics of received signals.

   docsIfDocsisBaseCapability - This object is used to indicate the
   highest level of DOCSIS version a cable device can support.

3.2.2.  docsIfCmObjects

   docsIfCmMacTable - This table is used to monitor the DOCSIS MAC
   interface and can be considered an extension to the ifEntry.

   docsIfCmStatusTable - This table maintains a number of status objects
   and counters for cable modems.  There is a comparable table at the
   CMTS, docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable, which maintains similar counters from
   the CMTS point of view.

   docsIfCmServiceTable - This table describes the upstream service
   queues available at this CM.  There is a comparable table at the
   CMTS, docsIfCmtsServiceEntry, which describes the service queues from
   the point of view of the CMTS.

3.2.3.  docsIfCmtsObjects

   docsIfCmtsMacTable - Describes the attributes of each CMTS MAC
   interface.

   docsIfCmtsStatusTable - This table provides a set of aggregated
   counters that roll-up values and events that occur on the underlying
   sub-interfaces.

   docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable - This table is used to hold information
   about known (i.e., ranging, registered, and/or previously online)
   cable modems on the system serviced by this CMTS.

   docsIfCmtsServiceTable - This table provides access to the
   information related to upstream service queues.

   docsIfCmtsModulationTable - This table allows control over the
   modulation profiles for RF channels associated with this CMTS.

   docsIfCmtsMacToCmTable - This table allows fast access into the
   docsIfCmtsCmTable via a MAC address (of the CM) interface.

   docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationTable - This table provides statistical
   load usage data for attached upstream and downstream physical
   channels.

   docsIfCmtsDownChannelCounterTable - This table provides statistical
   data for attached downstream channels, appropriate as input for load
   usage calculations.

   docsIfCmtsUpChannelCounterTable - This table provides statistical
   data for attached upstream channels, appropriate as input for load
   usage calculations.

3.2.4.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB Module

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB module to the
   Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  Several areas of correlation are addressed
   in the following subsections.  The implementer is referred to the
   Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the general intent of
   these areas.

3.2.4.1.  Layering Model

   An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF downstream interface, for
   each RF upstream interface, for each upstream logical Channel, and
   for each RF MAC layer.




Raftus & Cardona            Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 4546          DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB         June 2006


   The ifStackTable [RFC2863] MUST be implemented to identify the
   relationships among sub-interfaces.

   The following example illustrates a CMTS MAC interface with one
   downstream and two upstream interfaces.

                                 | <== to network layer
           +------------------ --+-------------------------------+

              |                  |                        |

                                 Figure 1

   As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on
   top of the downstream and upstream interfaces, and the RF upstream
   interface is layered on top of an upstream logical channel.

   In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows:

      ifIndex       ifType                     Description

   The corresponding ifStack entries would then be:

              | IfStackHigherLayer | ifStackLowerLayer |
              |         0          |         2         |

              |         7          |         0         |
              |         8          |         0         |
              |         9          |         0         |

                                 Figure 3

   The same interface model can also be used in Telephony or Telco
   Return systems.  A pure Telco Return system (Cable Modem, as well as
   Cable Modem Termination System) would not have upstream cable
   channels, only downstream cable channels.  Systems supporting both
   Telco Return and cable upstream channels can use the above model
   without modification.

   Telco Return upstream channel(s) management is outside the scope of
   this document.

3.2.4.2.  Virtual Circuits

   This medium does not support virtual circuits, and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB module.

3.2.4.3.  ifTestTable

   The ifTestTable is optional for DOCSIS CM/CMTS implementations, but
   is not specifically influenced by the RF MIB.

3.2.4.4.  ifRcvAddressTable

   The ifRcvAddressTable is optional for DOCSIS CM/CMTS implementations,
   but is not specifically influenced by the RF MIB.

   specified in the Interfaces MIB module.  See that MIB module for
   columns omitted from the descriptions below.

3.2.4.5.1.  ifEntry for Downstream Interfaces

   The ifEntry for downstream interfaces supports the
   ifGeneralInformationGroup and the ifPacketGroup of the Interfaces MIB
   module.  This is an output-only interface at the CMTS, and all input
   status counters -- ifIn* -- will return zero.  This is an input-only
   interface at the CM, and all output status counters -- ifOut* -- will
   return zero.

3.2.5.  Offline Upstream Parameters Handling

3.2.5.1.  Overview

   This section describes the offline configuration of the DOCSIS 2.0
   upstream logical interface parameters.  The purpose of this feature
   is to guarantee that upstream logical interface parameters (such as
   modulation profile, channel type, mini-slot size, and SCDMA
   attributes) are consistent prior to committing changes to an active
   upstream logical interface.  This mechanism can reduce possible
   downtime of the upstream interface by minimizing SNMP SET operations
   to in-service upstream interfaces.  This mechanism is supported by
   CMTSs and is not applicable to CMs.

3.2.5.2.  Operation

   This mechanism uses three upstream channel MIB objects defined for
   DOCSIS 2.0 CMTS implementations:





Raftus & Cardona            Standards Track                    [Page 22]

RFC 4546          DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB         June 2006


   docsIfUpChannelStatus - The RowStatus object for the creation of
   temporary interfaces in the upstream interface table.  A temporary
   entry is used to modify, validate, and commit upstream parameters of
   a physical interface.  In the CMTS, a physical upstream interface
   refers to an upstream logical channel interface.

   docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom - This MIB object associates a physical
   interface with a temporary interface for the purpose of updating the
   upstream parameters of the physical interface.

   docsIfUpChannelUpdate - This MIB object is the commit object that
   transfers the validated upstream parameters from the temporary
   interface to the physical interface.

   The offline upstream parameters handling operation is as follows:

   o  A temporary interface is created in which docsIfUpChannelStatus is
      set to 'createAndWait', which turns the new create entry status to
      'notReady'.

   o  A SET to docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom in the temporary interface to
      the physical interface ifIndex value performs two actions:

      *  Creates the association of the physical interface to the
         temporary interface.

      *  Copies the original upstream parameters from the physical
         interface to the temporary interface, which turns its status to
         'notInService'.

   o  The operator modifies the temporary interface parameters to the
      desired values.

   o  At this point, a SET to 'active' to the RowStatus of the temporary
      interface is successful if all parameters in the temporary
      interface are valid for the associated physical interface;
      otherwise, the temporary entry remains with status 'notInservice',
      and the SET returns the error 'commitFailed'.

   o  When the temporary interface status is 'active', a SET to
      docsIfUpChannelUpdate to 'true' transfers the temporary interface
      parameters values to the physical interface.

   o  After completion of the update operations, the temporary interface
      is destroyed, setting the docsIfUpChannelStatus to 'destroy'.

3.2.5.3.  Relation of docsIfUpChannelStatus and ifMib

   The main purpose of docsIfUpChannelStatus is the creation of
   temporary interfaces for offline handling of the configuration of
   physical interfaces; it does not manage the creation or control of
   physical interfaces.  To maintain a consistent operation and status
   report of interfaces, this object does not manage the administrative
   and operational status of physical interfaces.

                to take a physical upstream channel offline, to be
                consistent with DOCSIS 1.x operation, as indicated in
                RFC 2670.
                In addition,

             4. Temporary created rows MUST be set to 'active' with
                the purpose of validating upstream parameter
                consistency prior to transferring the parameters to the
                physical interface.

             Below is a mandatory procedure for adjusting the values
             of a physical interface:
             1. Create a temporary interface entry through an SNMP SET
                using 'createAndWait'.  At this point, the RowStatus
                reports 'notReady'.
                The Manager entity uses an ifIndex value outside the
                operational range of the physical interfaces for the
                creation of a temporary interface.
             2. Set the docsIfUpChannelCloneFrom object to the ifIndex
                value of the physical row to update.  Now
                docsIfUpChannelStatus reports 'notInService'.
             3. Change the upstream parameters to the desired values
                in the temporary row.

             4. Validate that all parameters are consistent by setting
                docsIfUpChannelStatus to 'active'.  A failure to set the
                RowStatus to 'active' returns the error 'commitFailed',
                which means the parameters are not compatible with the
                target physical interface.
             5. With docsIfUpChannelStatus 'active', transfer the
                parameters to the target physical interface by setting
                the object docsIfUpChannelUpdate to 'true'.

             the most recent docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationInterval.

             Upstream Channel Utilization Index:

             The upstream channel utilization index is expressed as a
             percentage of mini-slots utilized on the physical channel,
             regardless of burst type.  For an Initial Maintenance
             region, the mini-slots for the complete region are
             considered utilized if the CMTS received an upstream
             burst within the region from any CM on the physical
             channel.  For contention REQ and REQ/DATA regions, the
             mini-slots for a transmission opportunity within the
             region are considered utilized if the CMTS received an
             upstream burst within the opportunity from any CM on the
             physical channel.  For all other regions, utilized
             mini-slots are those in which the CMTS granted
             bandwidth to any unicast SID on the physical channel.

             For an upstream interface that has multiple logical
             upstream channels enabled, the utilization index is a
             weighted sum of utilization indices for the logical
             channels.  The weight for each utilization index is the
             percentage of upstream mini-slots allocated for the
             corresponding logical channel.
             Example:
             If 75% of bandwidth is allocated to the first logical
             channel and 25% to the second, and the utilization
             indices for each are 60 and 40, respectively, the

             utilization index for the upstream physical channel is
             (60 * 0.75) + (40 * 0.25) = 55.  This figure
             applies to the most recent utilization interval.

             Downstream Channel Utilization Index:

             The downstream channel utilization index is a percentage
             expressing the ratio between bytes used to transmit data
             versus the total number of bytes transmitted in the raw
             bandwidth of the MPEG channel.  As with the upstream
             utilization index, the calculated value represents
             the most recent utilization interval.
             Formula:
             Downstream utilization index =
             (100 * (data bytes / raw bytes))

             Definitions:
             Data bytes:    Number of bytes transmitted as data in the

RFC 4546          DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB         June 2006


5.  Revision History

5.1.  Scope

   The MIB module in this document has been developed to accommodate
   DOCSIS 2.0 devices and their system capabilities.  The MIB module is
   an update to RFC 2670 [RFC2670] with the additional incorporation of
   DOCSIS 2.0 [RFI2.0] and Euro-DOCSIS specification requirements
   [EN-300-429].

5.2.  Extension

   We have maintained the MIB objects as defined in RFC 2670 [RFC2670].
   In some cases new MIB objects have been created with identical
   functionality but greater capacity (i.e., 32 to 64 bits).  In these
   situations, both the original 32 bit objects and the new 64 bit
   objects must be implemented.

6.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module relates to a system that will provide metropolitan
   public internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the MIB
   objects represented by this MIB module may result in denial of
   service to a large number of end-users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The CMTS is the controller of most of the parameters of the DOCSIS
   RFI Interface.  Therefore, write access to the CMTS MIB objects may
   compromise the end-user's services.

   In the CM case, the only read-write object of this MIB module is
   docsIfCmRangingTimeout, which if SET maliciously, may not constitute
   a critical factor of service degradation.

   The rest of the CM-required MIB objects in this MIB module are read-
   only, either by definition, or by compliance statements.

   The CMTS is the controller of most of the parameters of the DOCSIS
   RFI Interface.  Below are the CMTS MIB object's vulnerabilities:

   o  Objects in the docsIfBasicGroupv2, if SET maliciously, could
      result in a denial of service.  Particularly, SETs to objects in

RFC 4546          DOCSIS 2.0 Radio Frequency (RFI) MIB         June 2006


      docsIfDownstreamChannelTable, docsIfUpstreamChannelTable,
      docsIfCmtsModulationTable, and docsIfQosProfileTable (the last one
      in conjunction with the MIB object
      docsIfCmtsQosProfilePermissions) can alter negatively the physical
      and link layer parameters of upstream and downstream channels.

   o  The Object docsIfCmtsServiceAdminStatus of the docsIfCmtsGroupv2
      group, when SET maliciously by an attacker to 'disabled' or
      'destroyed', will interrupt the service of the corresponding cable
      modem.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  Below are some sensitivity considerations:

   o  Read access to the MIB objects in tables docsIfCmStatusTable (CM),
      docsIfSignalQualityTable (CM/CMTS) and in CMTS tables
      docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable, docsIfCmtsChannelUtilizationTable,
      docsIfCmtsDownChannelCounterTable, and
      docsIfCmtsUpChannelCounterTable, could reveal information about
      the cable modems' distribution among the upstream and downstream
      channels and their performance, which could be used to gain access
      to a different tiered service offer.  The table
      docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable also contains the MAC and IP addresses of
      the cable modems, which can be used for theft of service.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  Management Interoperability of DOCSIS 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0

   The MIB module contained in this document updates RFC 2670 [RFC2670],
   primarily to handle the management requirements of the DOCSIS RF
   Interface of DOCSIS 2.0 [ITU-T_J.122].  RFC 2670 contains the DOCSIS
   RF Interface management requirements for DOCSIS 1.0 and DOCSIS 1.1.

   The management requirements of Class of Service (DOCSIS 1.0)
   pertaining to RFC 2670 are the same as this document update and are
   contained in the tables docsIfQosProfileTable, docsIfCmServiceTable,
   and docsIfCmtsServiceTable.

   DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 2.0 Quality of Service management requirements
   are defined in the DOCSIS management specifications [OSSI1.1] and
   [OSSI2.0], respectively.
