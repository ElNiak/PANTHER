RFC 7229                     PKIX TEST OIDs                     May 2014


1.  Introduction

   This document provides several certificate policy identifiers for
   testing certificate handling software.  These certificate policy
   identifiers are not intended for use in the public Internet.

   The certificate policy identifiers provided in this document are
   consistent with the certificate profile specified in [RFC5280].  They
   are appropriate for testing the certificate policy processing,
   especially the handling of the certificate policy extension, the
   policy constraints extension, and the policy mapping extension.

2.  Certificate Policy Identifiers for Testing

   The following certificate policy identifiers are provided for testing
   certificate handling software.  ASN.1 [ASN1-2008] object identifiers
   are used to name certificate policies.

      id-pkix OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)
                  dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }

      id-TEST OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 13 }

      -- Object Identifiers used ONLY for TESTING
      id-TEST-certPolicyOne       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 1 }
      id-TEST-certPolicyTwo       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 2 }
      id-TEST-certPolicyThree     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 3 }
      id-TEST-certPolicyFour      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 4 }
      id-TEST-certPolicyFive      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 5 }
      id-TEST-certPolicySix       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 6 }
      id-TEST-certPolicySeven     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 7 }
      id-TEST-certPolicyEight     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 8 }

3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not identify particular certificate policies
   for use in the Internet public key infrastructure.  The actual
   policies used for production certificates can have a significant
   impact on the confidence that one can place in the certificate.  No
   confidence should be placed in any certificate that makes use of
   these certificate policy identifiers, since they are intended only
   for testing.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The object identifiers used in this document are defined in an arc
   delegated by IANA to the PKIX Working Group.  No further action by
   IANA is necessary for this document or any anticipated updates.

Appendix A.  ASN.1 Module

   This appendix provides the certificate policy identifiers (object
   identifiers) in an ASN.1 module.  No fancy structures are needed, so
   this module is compatible with [ASN1-2008].

   PKIXTestCertPolicies { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6)
      internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-mod(0)
      id-mod-TEST-certPolicies(83) }

   DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::=

   BEGIN

   -- EXPORTS ALL --
   -- IMPORTS NONE --

   id-pkix OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)
               dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) }

   id-TEST OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 13 }

   -- Object Identifiers used ONLY for TESTING
   id-TEST-certPolicyOne       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 1 }
   id-TEST-certPolicyTwo       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 2 }
   id-TEST-certPolicyThree     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 3 }
   id-TEST-certPolicyFour      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 4 }
   id-TEST-certPolicyFive      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 5 }
   id-TEST-certPolicySix       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 6 }
   id-TEST-certPolicySeven     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 7 }
   id-TEST-certPolicyEight     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-TEST 8 }
