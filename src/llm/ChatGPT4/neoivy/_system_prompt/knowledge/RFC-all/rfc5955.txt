1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new media type for TimeStampedData envelopes.
   A TimeStampedData envelope, described in [RFC5544], binds a file with
   one or more time-stamp tokens obtained for that file.  A media type
   registration, lacking in [RFC5544], enhances shareability.

2.  Registration

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: timestamped-data

   Required parameters: none

   Optional parameters: none

   Encoding considerations: binary

   Security considerations:

      See the Security Considerations in the published specification.

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: RFC 5544

   Applications which use this media type:

      Any application that exchanges TimeStampedData envelopes over a
      MIME-based transport and possibly processes them, either directly
      or via external handlers or viewers.  Such applications may be,
      for instance, digital signature applications, archival systems,
      email clients, web browsers, etc.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):

      File extension(s): .tsd
