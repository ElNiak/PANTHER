           PPP LCP Internationalization Configuration Option

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Abstract

   The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for
   transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links.  PPP
   also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP), which allows
   negotiation of an Authentication Protocol for authenticating its peer
   before allowing Network Layer protocols to transmit over the link.

   Both LCP and Authentication Protocol packets may contain text which
   is intended to be human-readable [2,3,4].  This document defines an
   LCP configuration option for the negotiation of character set and
   language usage, as required by RFC 2277 [5].

2.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT" are to be interpreted as
   described in [6].

3.  Additional LCP Configuration Option

   The Configuration Option format and basic options are already defined
   for LCP [1].

RFC 2484            LCP Internationalization Option         January 1999


   Up-to-date values of the LCP Option Type field are specified in STD 2
   [7].  This document concerns the following value:

      28  Internationalization

   The Internationalization option described here MAY be negotiated
   independently in each direction.

   Only one instance of this option SHOULD be sent by an implementation,
   representing its preferred language and charset.

   If Internationalization option is rejected by the peer, the default
   language and charset MUST be used to construct all human-readable
   messages sent to the peer.

4.1.  Internationalization

   Description

      This Configuration Option provides a method for an implementation
      to indicate to the peer both the language in which human-readable
      messages it sends should be composed and the charset in which that
      language should be represented.

   A summary of the Internationalization option format is shown below.
   The fields are transmitted from left to right.

   MIBenum

      The MIBenum field is four octets in length.  It contains a unique
      integer value identifying a charset [5,11].

      This value MUST represent one of the set of charsets listed in the
      IANA charset registry [7].

      The charset registration procedure is described in RFC 2278 [9].

      The default charset value is UTF-8 [10].  The MIBenum value for
      the UTF-8 charset is 106.

   Language-Tag

      The Language-Tag field is an ASCII string which contains a
      language tag, as defined in RFC 1766 [8].

      Language tags are in principle case-insensitive; however, since
      the capitalization of a tag does not carry any meaning,
      implementations SHOULD send only lower-case Tag fields.

      The default Tag value is "i-default" [8].

5.  Security Considerations

   It is possible that an attacker might manipulate the option in such a
   way that displayable messages would be unintelligible to the reader.
