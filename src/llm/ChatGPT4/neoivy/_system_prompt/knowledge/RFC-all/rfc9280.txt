                      RFC Editor Model (Version 3)

Abstract

   This document specifies version 3 of the RFC Editor Model.  The model
   defines two high-level tasks related to the RFC Series.  First,
   policy definition is the joint responsibility of the RFC Series
   Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals, and the RFC
   Series Approval Board (RSAB), which approves such proposals.  Second,
   policy implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC
   Production Center (RPC) as contractually overseen by the IETF
   Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC).  In addition,
   various responsibilities of the RFC Editor function are now performed
   alone or in combination by the RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RFC Series Consulting
   Editor (RSCE), and IETF LLC.  Finally, this document establishes the
   Editorial Stream for publication of future policy definition
   documents produced through the processes defined herein.

   This document obsoletes RFC 8728.  This document updates RFCs 7841,
   8729, and 8730.

1.  Introduction

   The Request for Comments (RFC) Series is the archival series
   dedicated to documenting Internet technical specifications, including
   general contributions from the Internet research and engineering
   community as well as standards documents.  RFCs are available free of
   charge to anyone via the Internet.  As described in [RFC8700], RFCs
   have been published continually since 1969.

   RFCs are generated and approved by multiple document streams.
   Whereas the stream approving body [RFC8729] for each stream is
   responsible for the content of that stream, the RFC Editor function
   is responsible for the production and distribution of all RFCs.  The
   four existing streams are described in [RFC8729].  This document adds
   a fifth stream, the Editorial Stream, for publication of policies
   governing the RFC Series as a whole.

   The overall framework for the RFC Series and the RFC Editor function
   is described in [RFC8729] and is updated by this document, which
   defines version 3 of the RFC Editor Model.  Under this version,
   various responsibilities of the RFC Editor function are performed
   alone or in combination by the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), RFC
   Series Advisory Board (RSAB), RFC Production Center (RPC), RFC Series
   Consulting Editor (RSCE), and IETF Administration Limited Liability
   Company (IETF LLC) [RFC8711], which collectively comprise the RFC
   Editor function.  The intent is to ensure sustainable maintenance and
   support of the RFC Series based on the principles of expert
   implementation, clear management and direction, and appropriate
   community input [RFC8729].

   This document obsoletes [RFC8728] by defining version 3 of the RFC
   Editor Model.  This document updates [RFC7841] by defining
   boilerplate text for the Editorial Stream.  This document updates
   [RFC8729] by replacing the RFC Editor role with the RSWG, RSAB, and
   RSCE.  This document updates [RFC8730] by removing the dependency on
   certain policies specified by the IAB and RFC Series Editor (RSE).
   More detailed information about changes from version 2 of the RFC
   Editor Model can be found in Section 9.

2.  Overview of the Model

   This document divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into
   two high-level tasks:

   1.  Policy definition governing the RFC Series as a whole.  This is
       the joint responsibility of two entities.  First, the RFC Series
       Working Group (RSWG) is an open working group independent of the
       IETF that generates policy proposals.  Second, the RFC Series
       Approval Board (RSAB) is an appointed body that approves such
       proposals for publication in the Editorial Stream.  The RSAB
       includes representatives of the streams [RFC8729] as well as an
       expert in technical publishing, the RFC Series Consulting Editor
       (RSCE).

   2.  Policy implementation through publication of RFCs in all of the
       streams that form the RFC Series.  This is primarily the
       responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC) as
       contractually overseen by the IETF Administration Limited
       Liability Company (IETF LLC) [RFC8711].

   As described more fully in the remainder of this document, the core
   activities and responsibilities are as follows:

   *  The RSWG proposes policies that govern the RFC Series as a whole,
      with input from the community, the RSAB, and the RSCE.

   *  The RSAB considers those proposals and either approves them or
      returns them to the RSWG, which may make further changes or remove
      them from further consideration.

   *  If approved, such proposals are published as RFCs in the Editorial
      Stream and thus define the policies to be followed by the RSWG,
      RSAB, RSCE, and RPC.

   *  The RSCE provides expert advice to the RPC and RSAB on how to
      implement established policies on an ongoing and operational
      basis, which can include raising issues or initiating proposed
      policy changes within the RSWG.

   *  The RPC implements the policies defined by the Editorial Stream in
      its day-to-day editing and publication of RFCs from all of the
      streams.

   *  If issues arise with the implementation of particular policies,
      the RPC brings those issues to the RSAB, which interprets the
      policies and provides interim guidance to the RPC, informing the
      RSWG of those interpretations.

   This model is designed to ensure public processes and policy
   documents, clear lines of responsibility and authority, transparent
   mechanisms for updates and changes to policies governing the RFC
   Series as a whole, and effective operational implementation of the
   RFC Series, thus meeting the requirements specified in Section 4 of
   [RFC8729].

   The remainder of this document describes the model in greater detail.

3.  Policy Definition

   Policies governing the RFC Series as a whole are defined through the
   following high-level process:

   1.  Proposals must be submitted to, adopted by, and discussed within
       the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG).

   2.  Proposals must pass a Last Call for comments in the working group
       and a community call for comments (see Section 3.2.3).

   3.  Proposals must be approved by the RFC Series Approval Board
       (RSAB).

   Policies under the purview of the RSWG and RSAB might include, but
   are not limited to, document formats, processes for publication and
   dissemination of RFCs, and overall management of the RFC Series.

3.1.  Structure and Roles

3.1.1.  RFC Series Working Group (RSWG)

3.1.1.1.  Purpose

   The RFC Series Working Group (RSWG) is the primary venue in which
   members of the community collaborate regarding the policies that
   govern the RFC Series.

3.1.1.2.  Participation

   All interested individuals are welcome to participate in the RSWG;
   participants are subject to anti-harassment policies as described in
   Section 3.2.5.  This includes but is not limited to participants in
   the IETF and IRTF, members of the IAB and IESG, developers of
   software or hardware systems that implement RFCs, authors of RFCs and
   Internet-Drafts, developers of tools used to author or edit RFCs and
   Internet-Drafts, individuals who use RFCs in procurement decisions,
   scholarly researchers, and representatives of standards development
   organizations other than the IETF and IRTF.  The IETF LLC Board
   members, staff and contractors (especially representatives of the RFC
   Production Center), and the IETF Executive Director are invited to
   participate as community members in the RSWG to the extent permitted
   by any relevant IETF LLC policies.  Members of the RSAB are also
   expected to participate actively.

3.1.1.3.  Chairs

   The RSWG shall have two chairs, one appointed by the IESG and the
   other appointed by the IAB.  When the RSWG is formed, the chair
   appointed by the IESG shall serve for a term of one (1) year and the
   chair appointed by the IAB shall serve for a term of two (2) years;
   thereafter, chairs shall serve for a term of two (2) years, with no
   term limits on renewal.  The IESG and IAB shall determine their own
   processes for making these appointments, making sure to take account
   of any potential conflicts of interest.  Community members who have
   concerns about the performance of an RSWG Chair should direct their
   feedback to the appropriate appointing body via mechanisms such
   bodies shall specify at the time that the RSWG is formed.  The IESG
   and IAB shall have the power to remove their appointed chairs at
   their discretion at any time and to name a replacement who shall
   serve the remainder of the original chair's term.

   It is the responsibility of the chairs to encourage rough consensus
   within the RSWG and to follow that consensus in their decision
   making, for instance, regarding acceptance of new proposals and
   advancement of proposals to the RSAB.

3.1.1.4.  Mode of Operation

   The intent is that the RSWG shall operate in a way similar to that of
   working groups in the IETF.  Therefore, all RSWG meetings and
   discussion venues shall be open to all interested individuals, and
   all RSWG contributions shall be subject to intellectual property
   policies, which must be consistent with those of the IETF as
   specified in [BCP78] and [BCP79].

   When the RSWG is formed, all discussions shall take place on an open
   email discussion list, which shall be publicly archived.

   The RSWG is empowered to hold in-person, online-only, or hybrid
   meetings, which should be announced with sufficient notice to enable
   broad participation; the IESG Guidance on Face-to-Face and Virtual
   Interim Meetings (https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/
   interim-meetings-guidance-2016-01-16/) provides a reasonable
   baseline.  In-person meetings should include provision for effective
   online participation for those unable to attend in person.

   The RSWG shall operate by rough consensus, a mode of operation
   informally described in [RFC2418].

   The RSWG may decide by rough consensus to use additional tooling
   (e.g., GitHub as specified in [RFC8874]), forms of communication, and
   working methods (e.g., design teams) as long as they are consistent
   with this document and with [RFC2418] or its successors.

   Absent specific guidance in this document regarding the operation of
   the RSWG, the general guidance provided in Section 6 of [RFC2418]
   should be considered appropriate.

   The IETF LLC is requested to provide necessary tooling to support
   RSWG communication, decision processes, and policies.

   The IAB is requested to convene the RSWG when it is first formed in
   order to formalize the IAB's transfer of authority over the RFC
   Editor Model.

3.1.2.  RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB)

3.1.2.1.  Purpose

   The RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB), which includes representatives
   of all of the streams, shall act as the approving body for proposals
   generated within the RSWG, thus providing an appropriate set of
   checks and balances on the output of the RSWG.  The only policy-
   making role of the RSAB is to review policy proposals generated by
   the RSWG; it shall have no independent authority to formulate policy
   on its own.  It is expected that the RSAB will respect the rough
   consensus of the RSWG wherever possible, without ceding its
   responsibility to review RSWG proposals, as further described in
   Section 3.2.2.

3.1.2.2.  Members

   The RSAB consists primarily of the following voting members:

   *  A stream representative for the IETF Stream: either an IESG member
      or someone appointed by the IESG

   *  A stream representative for the IAB Stream: either an IAB member
      or someone appointed by the IAB

   *  A stream representative for the IRTF Stream: either the IRTF Chair
      or someone appointed by the IRTF Chair

   *  A stream representative for the Independent Stream: either the
      Independent Submissions Editor (ISE) [RFC8730] or someone
      appointed by the ISE

   *  The RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE)

   If and when a new stream is created, the document that creates the
   stream shall specify if a voting member representing that stream
   shall also be added to the RSAB, along with any rules and processes
   related to that representative (e.g., whether the representative is a
   member of the body responsible for the stream or an appointed
   delegate thereof).

   The RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) is a voting member of the
   RSAB but does not act as a representative of the Editorial Stream.

   To ensure the smooth operation of the RFC Series, the RSAB shall
   include the following non-voting, ex officio members:

   *  The IETF Executive Director or their delegate (the rationale is
      that the IETF LLC is accountable for implementation of policies
      governing the RFC Series)

   *  A representative of the RPC, named by the RPC (the rationale is
      that the RPC is responsible for implementation of policies
      governing the RFC Series)

   In addition, the RSAB may include other non-voting members at its
   discretion; these non-voting members may be ex officio members or
   liaisons from groups or organizations with which the RSAB deems it
   necessary to formally collaborate or coordinate.

3.1.2.3.  Appointment and Removal of Voting Members

   The appointing bodies (i.e., IESG, IAB, IRTF Chair, and ISE) shall
   determine their own processes for appointing RSAB members (note that
   processes related to the RSCE are described in Section 5).  Each
   appointing body shall have the power to remove its appointed RSAB
   member at its discretion at any time.  Appointing bodies should
   ensure that voting members are seated at all times and should fill
   any vacancies with all due speed, if necessary on a temporary basis.

   In the case that the IRTF Chair or ISE is incapacitated or otherwise
   unable to appoint another person to serve as a delegate, the IAB (as
   the appointing body for the IRTF Chair and ISE) shall act as the
   temporary appointing body for those streams and shall appoint a
   temporary member of the RSAB until the IAB has appointed an IRTF
   Chair or ISE, who can then act as an RSAB member or appoint a
   delegate through normal processes.

3.1.2.4.  Vacancies

   In the case of vacancies by voting members, the RSAB shall operate as
   follows:

   *  Activities related to implementation of policies already in force
      shall continue as normal.

   *  Voting on approval of policy documents produced by the RSWG shall
      be delayed until the vacancy or vacancies have been filled, up to
      a maximum of three (3) months.  If a further vacancy arises during
      this three-month period, the delay should be extended by up to
      another three months.  After the delay period expires, the RSAB
      should continue to process documents as described below.  Note
      that this method of handling vacancies does not apply to a vacancy
      of the RSCE role; it only applies to vacancies of the stream
      representatives enumerated in Section 3.1.2.2.

3.1.2.5.  Chair

   The RSAB shall annually choose a chair from among its members using a
   method of its choosing.  If the chair position is vacated during the
   chair's term, the RSAB chooses a new chair from among its members.

3.1.2.6.  Mode of Operation

   The RSAB is expected to operate via an email discussion list, in-
   person meetings, teleconferencing systems, and any additional tooling
   it deems necessary.

   The RSAB shall keep a public record of its proceedings, including
   minutes of all meetings and a record of all decisions.  The primary
   email discussion list used by the RSAB shall be publicly archived,
   although topics that require confidentiality (e.g., personnel
   matters) may be omitted from such archives or discussed in private.
   Similarly, meeting minutes may exclude detailed information about
   topics discussed under executive session but should note that such
   topics were discussed.

   The RSAB shall announce plans and agendas for their meetings on the
   RFC Editor website and by email to the RSWG at least a week before
   such meetings.  The meetings shall be open for public attendance, and
   the RSAB may consider allowing open participation.  If the RSAB needs
   to discuss a confidential matter in executive session, that part of
   the meeting shall be private to the RSAB, but it must be noted on the
   agenda and documented in the minutes with as much detail as
   confidentiality requirements permit.

   The IETF LLC is requested to provide necessary tooling and staff to
   support RSAB communication, decision processes, and policies.

   The IAB is requested to convene the RSAB when it is first formed in
   order to formalize the IAB's transfer of authority over the RFC
   Editor Model.

3.2.  Process

   This section specifies the RFC Series Policy Definition Process,
   which shall be followed in producing all Editorial Stream RFCs.

3.2.1.  Intent

   The intent is to provide an open forum by which policies related to
   the RFC Series are defined and evolved.  The general expectation is
   that all interested parties will participate in the RSWG and that
   only under extreme circumstances should RSAB members need to hold
   CONCERN positions (as described in Section 3.2.2).

   Because policy issues can be difficult and contentious, RSWG
   participants and RSAB members are strongly encouraged to work
   together in a spirit of good faith and mutual understanding to
   achieve rough consensus (see [RFC2418]).  In particular, RSWG members
   are encouraged to take RSAB concerns seriously, and RSAB members are
   encouraged to clearly express their concerns early in the process and
   to be responsive to the community.  All parties are encouraged to
   respect the value of each stream and the long-term health and
   viability of the RFC Series.

   This process is intended to be one of continuous consultation.  RSAB
   members should consult with their constituent stakeholders (e.g.,
   authors, editors, tool developers, and consumers of RFCs) on an
   ongoing basis, so that when the time comes to consider the approval
   of a proposal, there should be no surprises.  Appointing bodies are
   expected to establish whatever processes they deem appropriate to
   facilitate this goal.

3.2.2.  Workflow

   The following process shall be used to formulate or modify policies
   related to the RFC Series:

   1.   An individual or set of individuals generates a proposal in the
        form of an Internet-Draft (which must be submitted in full
        conformance with the provisions of [BCP78] and [BCP79]) and asks
        the RSWG to adopt the proposal as a working group item.

   2.   The RSWG may adopt the proposal as a working group item if the
        chairs determine (by following working group procedures for
        rough consensus) that there is sufficient interest in the
        proposal; this is similar to the way a working group of the IETF
        would operate (see [RFC2418]).

   3.   The RSWG shall then further discuss and develop the proposal.
        All participants, but especially RSAB members, should pay
        special attention to any aspects of the proposal that have the
        potential to significantly modify long-standing policies or
        historical characteristics of the RFC Series as described in
        Section 7.  Members of the RSAB are expected to participate as
        individuals in all discussions relating to RSWG proposals.  This
        should help to ensure that they are fully aware of proposals
        early in the RFC Series Policy Definition Process.  It should
        also help to ensure that RSAB members will raise any issues or
        concerns during the development of the proposal and not wait
        until the RSAB review period.  The RSWG Chairs are also expected
        to participate as individuals.

   4.   At some point, if the RSWG Chairs believe there may be rough
        consensus for the proposal to advance, they will issue a Last
        Call for comments within the working group.

   5.   After a comment period of suitable length, the RSWG Chairs will
        determine whether rough consensus for the proposal exists
        (taking their own feedback as individuals into account along
        with feedback from other participants).  If comments have been
        received and substantial changes have been made, additional Last
        Calls may be necessary.  Once the chairs determine that
        consensus has been reached, they shall announce their
        determination on the RSWG email discussion list and forward the
        document to the RSAB.

   6.   Once consensus is established in the RSWG, the RSAB shall issue
        a community call for comments as further described in
        Section 3.2.3.  If substantial comments are received in response
        to the community call for comments, the RSAB may return the
        proposal to the RSWG to consider those comments and make
        revisions to address the feedback received.  In parallel with
        the community call for comments, the RSAB itself shall also
        consider the proposal.

   7.   If the scope of the revisions made in the previous step is
        substantial, an additional community call for comments should be
        issued by the RSAB, and the feedback received should be
        considered by the RSWG.

   8.   Once the RSWG Chairs confirm that concerns received during the
        community call(s) for comments have been addressed, they shall
        inform the RSAB that the document is ready for balloting by the
        RSAB.

   9.   Within a reasonable period of time, the RSAB will poll its
        members for their positions on the proposal.  Positions may be
        as follows:

        *  YES: the proposal should be approved

        *  CONCERN: the proposal raises substantial concerns that must
           be addressed

        *  RECUSE: the person holding the position has a conflict of
           interest

        Any RSAB member holding a CONCERN position must explain their
        concern to the community in detail.  Nevertheless, the RSWG
        might not be able to come to consensus on modifications that
        will address the RSAB member's concern.

        There are three reasons why an RSAB member may file a position
        of CONCERN:

        *  The RSAB member believes that the proposal represents a
           serious problem for one or more of the individual streams.

        *  The RSAB member believes that the proposal would cause
           serious harm to the overall RFC Series, including harm to the
           long-term health and viability of the Series.

        *  The RSAB member believes, based on the results of the
           community call(s) for comments (Section 3.2.3), that rough
           consensus to advance the proposal is lacking.

        Because RSAB members are expected to participate in the
        discussions within the RSWG and to raise any concerns and issues
        during those discussions, most CONCERN positions should not come
        as a surprise to the RSWG.  Notwithstanding, late CONCERN
        positions are always possible if issues are identified during
        RSAB review or the community call(s) for comments.

   10.  If a CONCERN exists, discussion will take place within the RSWG.
        Again, all RSAB members are expected to participate.  If
        substantial changes are made in order to address CONCERN
        positions, an additional community call for comments might be
        needed.

   11.  A proposal without any CONCERN positions is approved.

   12.  If, after a suitable period of time, any CONCERN positions
        remain, a vote of the RSAB is taken.  If at least three voting
        members vote YES, the proposal is approved.

   13.  If the proposal is not approved, it is returned to the RSWG.
        The RSWG can then consider making further changes.

   14.  If the proposal is approved, a notification is sent to the
        community, and the document enters the queue for publication as
        an RFC within the Editorial Stream.

   15.  Policies may take effect immediately upon approval by the RSAB
        and before publication of the relevant RFC, unless they are
        delayed while the IETF LLC resolves pending resource or contract
        issues.

3.2.3.  Community Calls for Comment

   The RSAB is responsible for initiating and managing community calls
   for comments on proposals that have gained consensus within the RSWG.
   The RSAB should actively seek a wide range of input.  The RSAB seeks
   such input by, at a minimum, sending a notice to the
   rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org (mailto:rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org)
   email discussion list or to its successor or future equivalent.  RSAB
   members should also send a notice to the communities they directly
   represent (e.g., the IETF and IRTF).  Notices are also to be made
   available and archived on the RFC Editor website.  In addition, other
   communication channels can be established for notices (e.g., via an
   RSS feed or by posting to social media venues).

   In cases where a proposal has the potential to significantly modify
   long-standing policies or historical characteristics of the RFC
   Series as described in Section 7, the RSAB should take extra care to
   reach out to a very wide range of communities that make use of RFCs
   (as described in Section 3.1.1.2) since such communities might not be
   actively engaged in the RSWG directly.  The RSAB should work with the
   stream approving bodies and the IETF LLC to identify and establish
   contacts in such communities, assisted by the RSCE in particular.

   The RSAB should maintain a public list of communities that are
   contacted during calls for comments.

   A notice of a community call for comments contains the following:

   *  A subject line beginning with 'Call for Comments:'

   *  A clear, concise summary of the proposal

   *  A URL pointing to the Internet-Draft that defines the proposal

   *  Any explanations or questions for the community that the RSAB
      deems necessary (using their usual decision-making procedures)

   *  Clear instructions on how to provide public comments

   *  A deadline for comments

   A comment period will last not less than two weeks and should be
   longer if wide outreach is required.  Comments will be publicly
   archived on the RFC Editor website.

   The RSAB is responsible for considering comments received during a
   community call for comments.  If RSAB members conclude that such
   comments raise important issues that need to be addressed, they
   should do so by discussing those issues within the RSWG or (if the
   issues meet the criteria specified in Step 9 of Section 3.2.2)
   lodging a position of CONCERN during RSAB balloting.

3.2.4.  Appeals

   Appeals of RSWG Chair decisions shall be made to the RSAB.  Decisions
   of the RSWG Chairs can be appealed only on grounds of failure to
   follow the correct process.  Appeals should be made within thirty
   (30) days of any action or, in the case of failure to act, of notice
   having been given to the RSWG Chairs.  The RSAB will then decide if
   the process was followed and will direct the RSWG Chairs as to what
   procedural actions are required.

   Decisions of the RSAB can be appealed on grounds of failure to follow
   the correct process.  In addition, if the RSAB makes a decision in
   order to resolve a disagreement between authors and the RPC (as
   described in Section 4.4), appeals can be filed on the basis that the
   RSAB misinterpreted an approved policy.  Aside from these two cases,
   disagreements about the conduct of the RSAB are not subject to
   appeal.  Appeals of RSAB decisions shall be made to the IAB and
   should be made within thirty (30) days of public notice of the
   relevant RSAB decision (typically, when minutes are posted).  The IAB
   shall decide whether a process failure occurred and what (if any)
   corrective action should take place.

3.2.5.  Anti-Harassment Policy

   The IETF anti-harassment policy
   (https://www.ietf.org/about/groups/iesg/statements/anti-harassment-
   policy/) also applies to the RSWG and RSAB, which strive to create
   and maintain an environment in which people of many different
   backgrounds are treated with dignity, decency, and respect.
   Participants are expected to behave according to professional
   standards and to demonstrate appropriate workplace behavior.  For
   further information about these policies, see [RFC7154], [RFC7776],
   and [RFC8716].

3.2.6.  RFC Boilerplates

   RFC boilerplates (see [RFC7841]) are part of the RFC Style Guide, as
   defined in Section 4.2.  New or modified boilerplates considered
   under version 3 of the RFC Editor Model must be approved by the
   following parties, each of which has a separate area of
   responsibility with respect to boilerplates:

   *  The applicable stream, which approves that the boilerplate meets
      its needs

   *  The RSAB, which approves that the boilerplate is not in conflict
      with the boilerplate used in the other streams

   *  The RPC, which approves that the language of the boilerplate is
      consistent with the RFC Style Guide

   *  The IETF Trust, which approves that the boilerplate correctly
      states the Trust's position regarding rights and ownership

4.  Policy Implementation

4.1.  Roles and Processes

   Publication of RFCs is handled by the RFC Production Center (RPC).

   A few general considerations apply:

   *  The general roles and responsibilities of the RPC are defined by
      RFCs published in the Editorial Stream (i.e., not directly by the
      RSWG, RSAB, or RSCE), by existing RFCs that apply to the RPC and
      have not yet been superseded by Editorial Stream RFCs, and by the
      requisite contracts.

   *  The RPC is advised by the RSCE and RSAB, and it has a duty to
      consult with them under specific circumstances, such as those
      relating to disagreements between authors and the RPC as described
      in Section 4.4.

   *  The RPC is overseen by the IETF LLC to ensure that it performs in
      accordance with contracts in place.

   All matters of budget, timetable, and impact on its performance
   targets are between the RPC and IETF LLC.

   The RPC shall regularly provide reports to the IETF LLC, RSAB, RSWG,
   and broader community regarding its activities and any key risks or
   issues affecting it.

   In the event that the RPC is required to make a decision without
   consultation that would normally deserve consultation, or makes a
   decision against the advice of the RSAB, the RPC must notify the
   RSAB.

   This document does not specify the exact relationship between the
   IETF LLC and the RPC; for example, the work of the RPC could be
   performed by a separate corporate entity under contract to the IETF
   LLC, it could be performed by employees of the IETF LLC, or the IETF
   LLC could engage with independent contractors for some or all aspects
   of such work.  The exact relationship is a matter for the IETF LLC to
   determine.

   The IETF LLC is responsible for the method and management of the
   engagement of the RPC.  Therefore, the IETF LLC has authority over
   negotiating performance targets for the RPC and also has
   responsibility for ensuring that those targets are met.  Such
   performance targets are set based on the RPC's publication load and
   additional efforts required to implement policies specified in
   Editorial Stream RFCs, in existing RFCs that apply to the RPC and
   have not yet been superseded by Editorial Stream RFCs, and in the
   requisite contracts.  The IETF LLC may consult with the community
   regarding these targets.  The IETF LLC is empowered to appoint a
   manager or to convene a committee to complete these activities.

   If individuals or groups within the community have concerns about the
   performance of the RPC, they can request that the matter be
   investigated by the IETF LLC Board, the IETF Executive Director, or a
   point of contact designated by the IETF LLC Board.  Even if the IETF
   LLC opts to delegate this activity, concerns should be raised with
   the IETF LLC.  The IETF LLC is ultimately answerable to the community
   via the mechanisms outlined in [RFC8711].

4.2.  Working Practices

   In the absence of a high-level policy documented in an RFC or in the
   interest of specifying the detail of its implementation of such
   policies, the RPC can document working practices regarding the
   editorial preparation, final publication, and dissemination of RFCs.
   Examples include:

   *  Maintenance of a style guide that defines editorial standards for
      RFCs; specifically, the RFC Style Guide consists of [RFC7322] and
      the other documents and resources listed at [STYLEGUIDE].

   *  Instructions regarding the file formats that are accepted as input
      to the editing and publication process.

   *  Guidelines regarding the final structure and layout of published
      documents.  In the context of the XML vocabulary [RFC7991], such
      guidelines could include clarifications regarding the preferred
      XML elements and attributes used to capture the semantic content
      of RFCs.

4.3.  RPC Responsibilities

   The core responsibility of the RPC is the implementation of RFC
   Series policies through publication of RFCs (including the dimensions
   of document quality, timeliness of publication, and accessibility of
   results), while taking into account issues raised by the community
   through the RSWG and by the stream approving bodies.  More
   specifically, the RPC's responsibilities at the time of writing
   include the following:

   1.   Editing documents originating from all RFC streams to ensure
        that they are consistent with the editorial standards specified
        in the RFC Style Guide.

   2.   Creating and preserving records of edits performed on documents.

   3.   Identifying where editorial changes might have technical impact
        and seeking necessary clarification.

   4.   Establishing the publication readiness of each document through
        communication with the authors, IANA, or stream-specific
        contacts, supplemented if needed by the RSAB and RSCE.

   5.   Creating and preserving records of dialogue with document
        authors.

   6.   Requesting advice from the RSAB and RSCE as needed.

   7.   Providing suggestions to the RSAB and RSCE as needed.

   8.   Participating within the RSWG in the creation of new Editorial
        Stream RFCs that impact the RPC, specifically with respect to
        any challenges the RPC might foresee with regard to
        implementation of proposed policies.

   9.   Identifying topics and issues while processing documents or
        carrying out other responsibilities on this list for which they
        lack sufficient expertise, and identifying and conferring with
        relevant experts as needed.

   10.  Providing reports to the community on its performance and plans.

   11.  Consulting with the community on its plans.

   12.  Negotiating its specific plans and resources with the IETF LLC.

   13.  Providing sufficient resources to support reviews of RPC
        performance by the IETF LLC.

   14.  Coordinating with IANA to ensure that RFCs accurately document
        registration processes and assigned values for IANA registries.

   15.  Assigning RFC numbers.

   16.  Liaising with stream approving bodies and other representatives
        of the streams as needed.

   17.  Publishing RFCs, which includes:

        *  posting copies to the RFC Editor site both individually and
           in collections

        *  depositing copies with external archives

        *  creating catalogs and catalog entries

        *  announcing the publication to interested parties

   18.  Providing online access to RFCs.

   19.  Providing an online system to facilitate the submission,
        management, and display of errata to RFCs.

   20.  Maintaining the RFC Editor website.

   21.  Providing for the backup of RFCs.

   22.  Ensuring the storage and preservation of records.

   23.  Authenticating RFCs for legal proceedings.

4.4.  Resolution of Disagreements between Authors and the RPC

   During the process of editorial preparation and publication,
   disagreements can arise between the authors of an RFC-to-be and the
   RPC.  Where an existing policy clearly applies, typically such
   disagreements are handled in a straightforward manner through direct
   consultation between the authors and the RPC, sometimes in
   collaboration with stream-specific contacts.

   However, if it is unclear whether an existing policy applies or if it
   is unclear how to interpret an existing policy, the parties may need
   to consult with additional individuals or bodies (e.g., RSAB, IESG,
   IRSG, or stream approving bodies) to help achieve a resolution.  The
   following points are intended to provide more specific guidance.

   *  If there is a conflict with a policy for a particular stream, to
      help achieve a resolution, the RPC should consult with the
      relevant stream approving body (such as the IESG or IRSG) and
      other representatives of the relevant stream as appropriate.

   *  If there is a conflict with a cross-stream policy, the RPC should
      consult with the RSAB to achieve a resolution.

   *  The disagreement might raise a new issue that is not covered by an
      existing policy or that cannot be resolved through consultation
      between the RPC and other relevant individuals and bodies, as
      described above.  In this case, the RSAB is responsible for (a)
      resolving the disagreement in a timely manner if necessary so that
      the relevant stream document(s) can be published before a new
      policy is defined and (b) bringing the issue to the RSWG so that a
      new policy can be defined.

4.5.  Point of Contact

   From time to time, individuals or organizations external to the IETF
   and the broader RFC Series community may have questions about the RFC
   Series.  Such inquiries should be directed to the
   rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org (mailto:rfc-editor@rfc-editor.org) email
   alias or to its successor or future equivalent and then handled by
   the appropriate bodies (e.g., RSAB and RPC) or individuals (e.g.,
   RSWG Chairs and RSCE).

4.6.  Administrative Implementation

   The exact implementation of the administrative and contractual
   activities described here are a responsibility of the IETF LLC.  This
   section provides general guidance regarding several aspects of such
   activities.

4.6.1.  Vendor Selection for the RPC

   Vendor selection is done in cooperation with the streams and under
   the final authority of the IETF LLC.

   The IETF LLC develops the work definition (the Statement of Work) for
   the RPC and manages the vendor-selection process.  The work
   definition is created within the IETF LLC budget and takes into
   account the RPC responsibilities (as described in Section 4.3), the
   needs of the streams, and community input.

   The process to select and contract for the RPC and other RFC-related
   services is as follows:

   *  The IETF LLC establishes the contract process, including the steps
      necessary to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) when necessary,
      the timing, and the contracting procedures.

   *  The IETF LLC establishes a selection committee, which will consist
      of the IETF Executive Director and other members selected by the
      IETF LLC in consultation with the stream approving bodies.  The
      committee shall select a chair from among its members.

   *  The selection committee selects the vendor, subject to the
      successful negotiation of a contract approved by the IETF LLC.  In
      the event that a contract cannot be signed, the matter shall be
      referred to the selection committee for further action.

4.6.2.  Budget

   Most expenses discussed in this document are not new expenses.  They
   have been and remain part of the IETF LLC budget.

   The RFC Series portion of the IETF LLC budget shall include funding
   to support the RSCE, the RFC Production Center, and the Independent
   Stream.

   The IETF LLC has the responsibility to approve the total RFC Editor
   budget (and the authority to deny it).  All relevant parties must
   work within the IETF LLC budgetary process.

5.  RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE)

   The RFC Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) is a senior technical
   publishing professional who will apply their deep knowledge of
   technical publishing processes to the RFC Series.

   The primary responsibilities of the RSCE are as follows:

   *  Serve as a voting member on the RSAB

   *  Identify problems with the RFC publication process and
      opportunities for improvement

   *  Provide expert advice within the RSWG regarding policy proposals

   *  Provide expert advice to the RPC and IETF LLC

   Matters on which the RSCE might provide guidance could include the
   following (see also Section 4 of [RFC8729]):

   *  Editing, processing, and publication of RFCs

   *  Publication formats for the RFC Series

   *  Changes to the RFC Style Guide

   *  Series-wide guidelines regarding document content and quality

   *  Web presence for the RFC Series

   *  Copyright matters related to the RFC Series

   *  Archiving, indexing, and accessibility of RFCs

   The IETF LLC is responsible for the method and management of the
   engagement of the RSCE, including selection, evaluation, and the
   timely filling of any vacancy.  Therefore, whether the RSCE role is
   structured as a contractual or employee relationship is a matter for
   the IETF LLC to determine.

5.1.  RSCE Selection

   Responsibility for making a recommendation to the IETF LLC regarding
   the RSCE role will lie with a selection committee.  The IETF LLC
   should propose an initial slate of members for this committee, making
   sure to include community members with diverse perspectives, and
   consult with the stream representatives regarding the final
   membership of the committee.  In making its recommendation for the
   role of RSCE, the selection committee will take into account the
   definition of the role as well as any other information that the
   committee deems necessary or helpful in making its decision.  The
   IETF LLC is responsible for contracting or employment of the RSCE.

5.2.  RSCE Performance Evaluation

   Periodically, the IETF LLC will evaluate the performance of the RSCE,
   including a call for confidential input from the community.  The IETF
   LLC will produce a draft evaluation of the RSCE's performance for
   review by RSAB members (other than the RSCE), who will provide
   feedback to the IETF LLC.

5.3.  Temporary RSCE Appointment

   In the case that the currently appointed RSCE is expected to be
   unavailable for an extended period, the IETF LLC may appoint a
   Temporary RSCE through whatever recruitment process it considers
   appropriate.  A Temporary RSCE acts as the RSCE in all aspects during
   their term of appointment.

5.4.  Conflict of Interest

   The RSCE is expected to avoid even the appearance of conflict of
   interest or judgment in performing their role.  To ensure this, the
   RSCE will be subject to a conflict-of-interest policy established by
   the IETF LLC.

   The RPC service provider may contract services from the RSCE service
   provider, and vice versa, including services provided to the IETF
   LLC.  All contracts between the two must be disclosed to the IETF
   LLC.  Where those services are related to services provided to the
   IETF LLC, IETF LLC policies shall apply, including publication of
   relevant parts of the contract.

6.  Editorial Stream

   This document creates the Editorial Stream as a separate space for
   publication of policies, procedures, guidelines, rules, and related
   information regarding the RFC Series as a whole.

   The Editorial Stream shall be used only to specify and update
   policies, procedures, guidelines, rules, and related information
   regarding the RFC Series as a whole; no other use of the Editorial
   Stream is authorized by this memo, and no other streams are so
   authorized.  This policy may be changed only by agreement of the IAB,
   IESG, and IETF LLC.

   All documents produced by the RSWG and approved by the RSAB shall be
   published as RFCs in the Editorial Stream with a status of
   Informational.  (Note that the Editorial Stream is not authorized to
   publish RFCs that are Standards Track or Best Current Practice, since
   such RFCs are reserved for the IETF Stream [RFC8729].)
   Notwithstanding the status of Informational, it should be understood
   that documents published in the Editorial Stream define policies for
   the RFC Series as a whole.

   The requirements and process for creating any additional RFC streams
   are outside the scope of this document.

6.1.  Procedures Request of the IETF Trust

   The IAB requests that the IETF Trust and its Trustees assist in
   meeting the goals and procedures set forth in this document.

   The Trustees are requested to publicly confirm their willingness and
   ability to accept responsibility for the Intellectual Property Rights
   (IPR) for the Editorial Stream.

   Specifically, the Trustees are asked to develop the necessary
   boilerplate to enable the suitable marking of documents so that the
   IETF Trust receives the rights as specified in [BCP78].  These
   procedures need to also allow authors to indicate either no rights to
   make derivative works or, preferentially, the right to make unlimited
   derivative works from the documents.  It is left to the Trust to
   specify exactly how this shall be clearly indicated in each document.

6.2.  Patent and Trademark Rules for the Editorial Stream

   As specified above, contributors of documents for the Editorial
   Stream are expected to use the IETF Internet-Draft process, complying
   therein with the rules specified in [BCP9].  This includes the
   disclosure of patent and trademark issues that are known, or can be
   reasonably expected to be known, to the contributor.

   Disclosure of license terms for patents is also requested, as
   specified in [BCP79].  The Editorial Stream has chosen to use the
   IETF's IPR disclosure mechanism (https://www.ietf.org/ipr/) for this
   purpose.  The IAB would prefer that the most liberal terms possible
   be made available for Editorial Stream documents.  Terms that do not
   require fees or licensing are preferable.  Non-discriminatory terms
   are strongly preferred over those that discriminate among users.
   However, although disclosure is required and the RSWG and the RSAB
   may consider disclosures and terms in making a decision as to whether
   to submit a document for publication, there are no specific
   requirements on the licensing terms for intellectual property related
   to Editorial Stream publication.

6.3.  Editorial Stream Boilerplate

   This document specifies the following text for the "Status of This
   Memo" section of RFCs published in the Editorial Stream.  Any changes
   to this boilerplate must be made through the RFC Series Policy
   Definition Process specified in Section 3 of this document.

   Because all Editorial Stream RFCs have a status of Informational, the
   first paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" section shall be as
   specified in Appendix A.2.1 of [RFC7841].

   The second paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" section shall be as
   follows:

      This document is a product of the RFC Series Policy Definition
      Process.  It represents the consensus of the RFC Series Working
      Group approved by the RFC Series Approval Board.  Such documents
      are not candidates for any level of Internet Standard; see
      Section 2 of RFC 7841.

   The third paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" section shall be as
   specified in Section 3.5 of [RFC7841].

7.  Historical Properties of the RFC Series

   This section lists some of the properties that have been historically
   regarded as important to the RFC Series.  Proposals that affect these
   properties are possible within the processes defined in this
   document.  As described in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, proposals that
   might have a detrimental effect on these properties should receive
   heightened scrutiny during RSWG discussion and RSAB review.  The
   purpose of this scrutiny is to ensure that all changes are deliberate
   and that the consequences of a proposal, as far as they can be
   identified, have been carefully considered.

7.1.  Availability

   Documents in the RFC Series have been available for many decades,
   with no restrictions on access or distribution.

7.2.  Accessibility

   RFC Series documents have been published in a format that was
   intended to be as accessible as possible to people with disabilities,
   e.g., people with impaired sight.

7.3.  Language

   All existing RFC Series documents have been published in English.
   However, since the beginning of the RFC Series, documents have been
   published under terms that explicitly allow translation into
   languages other than English without asking for permission.

7.4.  Diversity

   The RFC Series has included many types of documents including
   standards for the Internet, procedural and informational documents,
   thought experiments, speculative ideas, research papers, histories,
   humor, and even eulogies.

7.5.  Quality

   RFC Series documents have been reviewed for subject matter quality
   and edited by professionals with a goal of ensuring that documents
   are clear, consistent, and readable [RFC7322].

7.6.  Stability

   Once published, RFC Series documents are not changed.

7.7.  Longevity

   RFC Series documents have been published in a form intended to be
   comprehensible to humans for decades or longer.

8.  Updates to This Document

   Updates, amendments, and refinements to this document can be produced
   using the process documented herein but shall be published and
   operative only after (a) obtaining the agreement of the IAB and the
   IESG and (b) ensuring that the IETF LLC has no objections regarding
   its ability to implement any proposed changes.

9.  Changes from Version 2 of the RFC Editor Model

   The processes and organizational models for publication of RFCs have
   changed significantly over the years.  Most recently, in 2009,
   [RFC5620] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 1), and in 2012,
   [RFC6635] defined the RFC Editor Model (Version 2), which was then
   modified slightly in 2020 by [RFC8728].

   However, the community experienced several problems with versions 1
   and 2, including a lack of transparency, a lack of avenues for
   community input into policy definition, and unclear lines of
   authority and responsibility.

   To address these problems, in 2020, the IAB formed the RFC Editor
   Future Development Program to conduct a community discussion and
   consensus process for the further evolution of the RFC Editor Model.
   Under the auspices of this Program, the community considered changes
   that would increase transparency and community input regarding the
   definition of policies for the RFC Series as a whole, while at the
   same time ensuring the continuity of the RFC Series, maintaining the
   quality and timely publication of RFCs, ensuring document
   accessibility, and clarifying lines of authority and responsibility.

   This document is the result of discussion within the Program and
   describes version 3 of the RFC Editor Model while remaining
   consistent with [RFC8729].

   The following sections describe the changes from version 2 in more
   detail.

9.1.  RFC Editor Function

   Several responsibilities previously assigned to the RFC Editor or,
   more precisely, the RFC Editor function, are now performed by the
   RSWG, RSAB, RPC, RSCE, and IETF LLC (alone or in combination).  These
   include various aspects of strategic leadership (Section 2.1.1 of
   [RFC8728]), representation of the RFC Series (Section 2.1.2 of
   [RFC8728]), development of RFC production and publication
   (Section 2.1.3 of [RFC8728]), development of the RFC Series
   (Section 2.1.4 of [RFC8728]), operational oversight (Section 3.3 of
   [RFC8729]), policy oversight (Section 3.4 of [RFC8729]), the editing,
   processing, and publication of documents (Section 4.2 of [RFC8729]),
   and development and maintenance of guidelines and rules that apply to
   the RFC Series (Section 4.4 of [RFC8729]).  Among other things, this
   changes the dependency on the RFC Series Editor (RSE) included in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC8730] with regard to "coordinating work and
   conforming to general RFC Series policies as specified by the IAB and
   RSE."  In addition, various details regarding these responsibilities
   have been modified to accord with the framework defined in this
   document.

9.2.  RFC Series Editor

   Implied by the changes outlined in the previous section, the
   responsibilities of the RFC Series Editor (RSE) as a person or role
   (contrasted with the overall RFC Editor function) are now split or
   shared among the RSWG, RSAB, RSCE, RPC, and IETF LLC (alone or in
   combination).  More specifically, the responsibilities of the RFC
   Series Consulting Editor (RSCE) under version 3 of the RFC Editor
   Model differ in many ways from the responsibilities of the RFC Series
   Editor under version 2 of the RFC Editor Model.  In general,
   references in existing documents to the RSE can be taken as referring
   to the RFC Editor function as described herein but should not be
   taken as referring to the RSCE.

9.3.  RFC Publisher

   In practice, the RFC Production Center (RPC) and RFC Publisher roles
   have been performed by the same entity, and this practice is expected
   to continue; therefore, this document dispenses with the distinction
   between these roles and refers only to the RPC.

9.4.  IAB

   Under earlier versions of the RFC Editor Model, the IAB was
   responsible for oversight of the RFC Series and acted as a body for
   final conflict resolution regarding the RFC Series.  The IAB's
   authority in these matters is described in the IAB Charter
   ([RFC2850], as updated by [RFC9283]).  Under version 2 of the RFC
   Editor Model, the IAB delegated some of its authority to the RFC
   Series Oversight Committee (see Section 9.5).  Under version 3 of the
   RFC Editor Model, authority for policy definition resides with the
   RSWG as an independent venue for work by members of the community
   (with approval of policy proposals being the responsibility of the
   RSAB, which represents the streams and includes the RSCE), whereas
   authority for policy implementation resides with the IETF LLC.

9.5.  RFC Series Oversight Committee (RSOC)

   In practice, the relationships and lines of authority and
   responsibility between the IAB, RSOC, and RSE have proved unwieldy
   and somewhat opaque.  To overcome some of these issues, this document
   dispenses with the RSOC.  References to the RSOC in documents such as
   [RFC8730] are obsolete because this document disbands the RSOC.

9.6.  RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG)

   Version 1 of the RFC Editor Model [RFC5620] specified the existence
   of the RFC Series Advisory Group (RSAG), which was no longer
   specified in version 2 of the RFC Editor Model.  For the avoidance of
   doubt, this document affirms that the RSAG has been disbanded.  (The
   RSAG is not to be confused with the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB),
   which this document establishes.)

9.7.  Editorial Stream

   This document creates the Editorial Stream in addition to the streams
   already described in [RFC8729].

10.  Security Considerations

   The same security considerations as those in [RFC8729] apply.  The
   processes for the publication of documents must prevent the
   introduction of unapproved changes.  Because multiple entities
   described in this document (most especially the RPC) participate in
   maintenance of the index of publications, sufficient security must be
   in place to prevent these published documents from being changed by
   external parties.  The archive of RFC documents, any source documents
   needed to recreate the RFC documents, and any associated original
   documents (such as lists of errata, tools, and, for some early items,
   originals that are not machine-readable) need to be secured against
   data storage failure.

   The IETF LLC (along with any other contracting or contracted
   entities) should take these security considerations into account
   during the implementation and enforcement of any relevant contracts.

11.  IANA Considerations

   The RPC is responsible for coordinating with the IANA to ensure that
   RFCs accurately document registration processes and assigned values
   for IANA registries.

   The IETF LLC facilitates management of the relationship between the
   RPC and IANA.

   This document does not create a new registry nor does it register any
   values in existing registries, and no IANA action is required.
