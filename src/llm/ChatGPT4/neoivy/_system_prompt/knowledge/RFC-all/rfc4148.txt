Abstract

   This memo defines a registry for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM).  It
   assigns and registers an initial set of OBJECT IDENTITIES to
   currently defined metrics in the IETF.

   This memo also defines the rules for adding IP Performance Metrics
   that are defined in the future and for encouraging all IP performance
   metrics to be registered here.

   IANA has been assigned to administer this new registry.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This memo defines a registry of the current metrics and a framework
   for the integration of future metrics for the following reasons:

   o  to permit metrics to be clearly referenced by MIB modules or other
      data models;

   o  to provide metrics identifiers for measurement interoperability;

   o  to take special care with the integration of future standardized
      metrics because it is a continuous process;

   o  to provide room where other standards bodies can register their
      metrics in order to encourage IP performance metrics to have
      OBJECT IDENTITIES rooted at a common point because the intent of
      the IPPM WG is to cooperate with other appropriate standards
      bodies (or fora) to promote consistent metrics;

   o  and, similarly, to provide room for enterprises to register
      metrics.

3.  IP Performance Metrics Registry Framework

   MIB modules need to be able to reference IPPM Metrics precisely.  The
   registry associates an OBJECT-IDENTITY with each metric.  For
   example, Type-P-One-way-Delay and Type-P-One-way-Delay-Poisson-Stream
   have different OBJECT IDENTITIES.

   The registry has one branch.  Metrics are identified in the
   'ianaIppmMetrics' subtree.

RFC 4148            IP Performance Metrics Registry          August 2005


   This document defines an initial registry of the existing metrics
   defined in the IPPM WG and the rules to manage the registry.

   Documents defining metrics in the future will include in the IANA
   section the registration information to identify these metrics
   unambiguously.

4.  Initial IPPM Metrics Registry Creation

   The initial registry identifies the metrics currently defined in the
   RFCs produced in the IPPM WG.  To date, the IPPM WG defined 33
   metrics related to the following 7 topics:

   1.  IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [RFC2678]

   2.  One-way Delay Metrics, RFC 2679 [RFC2679]

   3.  One-way Packet Loss Metrics, RFC 2680 [RFC2680]

   4.  Round-trip Delay Metrics, RFC 2681 [RFC2681]

   5.  One-way Loss Pattern Sample Metrics, RFC 3357 [RFC3357]

   6.  IP Packet Delay Variation Metric, RFC 3393 [RFC3393]

   7.  IPPM Metrics for periodic streams, RFC 3432 [RFC3432]

   These are sequentially registered in the node ianaIppmMetrics.

   The naming conventions used for the existing metrics, and encouraged
   for new IPPM metrics, are:

   o  Metrics names conform SMIv2 rules for descriptors defined in
      section 3.1 of [RFC2578];

   o  The name starts with the prefix 'ietf';

   o  'Type-P' prefix is removed;

   o  '-' are removed;

   o  The letter following a '-' is changed to uppercase.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section describes the rules for the management of the registry
   by IANA.

5.1.  Management Rules

   Registrations are done sequentially by IANA in the ianaIppmMetrics
   subtree on the basis of 'Specification Required', as defined in
   [RFC2434].

   The reference of the specification must point to a stable document
   including a title, a revision, and a date.

   The name always starts with the name of the organization and must
   respect the SMIv2 rules for descriptors defined in section 3.1 of
   [RFC2578].

   A document that creates new metrics would have an "IANA
   Considerations" section in which it would describe new metrics to be
   registered.

   An OBJECT IDENTITY assigned to a metric is definitive and cannot be
   reused.  If a new version of a metric is produced, then it is
   assigned with a new name and a new identifier.

5.2.  Registration Template

   The following is a proposed template to insert in the IANA
   considerations section.  For each metric, that section would
   instantiate the following statement:

      IANA has registed the following metric in the IANA-IPPM-METRICS-
      REGISTRY-MIB:

       aNewMetricName OBJECT-IDENTITY
       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
          "The identifier for a new metric."
       REFERENCE
          "Reference R, section n."
          ::= { ianaIppmMetrics nn }     -- IANA assigns nn

6.  Initial IPPM Registry Definition

7.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   assigns a set of OBJECT-IDENTITIES which may be used by other MIB
   modules to identify specific IP Performance Metrics.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.
