             A User Agent Profile Data Set for Media Policy

Abstract

   This specification defines an XML document format to describe the
   media properties of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) sessions.
   Examples for media properties are the codecs or media types used in
   the session.  This document also defines an XML document format to
   describe policies that limit the media properties of SIP sessions.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Within the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], "A Framework
   for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agent Profile Delivery"
   [RFC6080] and "A Framework for SIP Session Policies" [RFC6794] define
   mechanisms to convey session policies and configuration information
   from a network server to a user agent.  An important piece of the
   information conveyed to the user agent relates to the media
   properties of the SIP sessions set up by the user agent.  Examples
   for these media properties are the codecs and media types used, the
   media-intermediaries to be traversed, or the maximum bandwidth
   available for media streams.

   This specification defines a document format for media properties of
   SIP sessions: the Media Policy Data Set Format (MPDF).  This format
   can be used in two ways.  First, it can be used to describe the
   properties of a given SIP session (e.g., the media types and codecs
   used).  These MPDF documents are called session info documents and
   they are usually created based on the session description of a
   session.  Second, the MPDF format can be used to define policies for
   SIP sessions in a session policy document.  A session policy document
   defines properties for a session (e.g., the media types allowed in a
   session), independent of a specific session description.

   If used with "A Framework for SIP Session Policies" [RFC6794],
   session info documents are used in conjunction with session-specific
   policies.  A session info document is created by a user agent (UA)
   based on the current session description and submitted to the policy
   server.  The policy server examines the session info document,
   modifies it if necessary (e.g., by removing video streams if video is
   not permitted), and returns the possibly modified session info
   document to the UA.  Session policy documents, on the other hand, are
   used to describe session-independent policies that can be submitted
   to the UA independent of a specific session.

   The two types of MPDF documents, session information and session
   policy documents, share the same set of XML elements to describe
   session properties.  Since these elements are used in different
   contexts for session info and session policy documents, two different
   root elements exist for the two document types: <session-info> is the
   root element for session information documents and <session-policy>
   is the root element for session policy documents.

   A user agent can receive multiple session policy documents from
   different sources.  This can lead to a situation in which the user
   agent needs to apply multiple session policy documents to the same
   session.  This standard specifies merging rules for those XML
   elements that can be present in session policy documents.  It should



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   be noted that these merging rules are part of the semantics of a
   session policy XML element.  User agents implement the merging rules
   as part of implementing the element semantics.  As a consequence, it
   is not possible to build an entity that can mechanically merge two
   session policy documents without understanding the semantics of all
   elements in the input documents.

   Merging rules are not needed for elements of session information
   documents since they are created by one source and describe a
   specific session.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Media Policy Data Set Format

   This section discusses fundamental properties of the Media Policy
   Data Set Format (MPDF).

3.1.  Namespace and Media Type

   The MPDF format is based on XML [W3C.REC-xml-20081126].  An MPDF
   document MUST be well-formed and MUST be valid according to schemas,
   including extension schemas, available to the validator and
   applicable to the XML document.  MPDF documents MUST be based on XML
   1.0 and MUST be encoded using UTF-8.

   MPDF makes use of XML namespaces [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114].  The
   namespace URIs for elements defined in this specification are URNs
   [RFC2141], using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by [RFC2648]
   and extended by [RFC3688].  The namespace URN for the MPDF schema is:

      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mediadataset

   The media type for the Media Policy Data Set Format is:

      application/media-policy-dataset+xml

3.2.  Extensibility

   The MPDF format can be extended using XML extension mechanisms if
   additional media properties are needed.  In particular, elements from
   different XML namespaces MAY be present within a MPDF document for
   the purposes of extensibility; elements or attributes from unknown
   namespaces MUST be ignored.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


3.3.  Attributes

   The following attributes can be used with elements of the MPDF
   format.  The specification of each MPDF element lists which of these
   attributes can be used.  If an element bears an attribute that may
   not be used with it, the user agent MUST ignore the attribute.

3.3.1.  The 'visibility' Attribute

   The attribute 'visibility' specifies whether or not the user agent is
   advised to display the property value to the user.  This is used to
   hide setting values that the administrator may not want the user to
   see or know.  The 'visibility' attribute has two possible values:

   o  visible: specifies that display of the property value is not
      restricted.  This is the default value of the attribute if it is
      not specified.

   o  hidden: Specifies that the user agent is advised not to display
      the property value.  Display of the property value may be allowed
      using special administrative interfaces, but it is not appropriate
      for the ordinary user.

3.3.2.  The 'direction' Attributes

   Some properties are unidirectional and only apply to messages or data
   streams transmitted into one direction.  For example, a property for
   media streams can be restricted to outgoing media streams only.
   Unidirectional properties can be expressed by adding a 'direction'
   attribute to the respective element.

   The 'direction' attribute can have the following values:

   o  recvonly: the property only applies to incoming streams.

   o  sendonly: the property only applies to outgoing streams.

   o  sendrecv: the property applies to streams in both directions.
      This is the default value that is used if the 'direction'
      attribute is omitted.

3.3.3.  The 'q' Attribute

   It is possible to express a preference for a certain value relative
   to the other values within a set of multiple values that are allowed
   within a property.  For example, it is possible to express that the
   codecs G.711 and G.729 are allowed, but G.711 is preferred.
   Preferences are to be expressed by adding a 'q' attribute to a



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   property element.  The 'q' attribute is only allowed in elements that
   specify allowed values (as opposed to elements that specify forbidden
   values).

   The value of the 'q' attribute is a decimal number within the range
   of 0 to 1, inclusive, with two or fewer decimal places.  An element
   with a higher 'q' value is preferred over one with a lower 'q' value.

3.3.4.  The 'media-type' Attribute

   The media-type attribute is used to define that an element only
   applies to streams of a certain media type, as defined in Section
   8.2.1 of [RFC4566].  For example, it may only apply to audio streams.
   The value of the 'media-type' attribute MUST be the media type, such
   as audio, video, text, or application.

3.3.5.  The 'label' Attribute

   The label attribute is used to identify a specific media stream.  The
   value of the label attribute is a token, whose syntax is defined in
   [RFC4574].  The token can be chosen freely; however, it MUST be
   unique among all <stream> elements in a session-info document.

3.3.6.  The 'enabled' Attribute

   The 'enabled' attribute specifies whether or not the user agent is
   allowed to establish a media stream.  This boolean attribute has two
   possible values:

   o  yes: specifies that the media stream can be established.  This is
      the default value of the attribute if it is not specified.

   o  no: specifies that the user agent MUST NOT establish the media
      stream.

4.  Session Info Documents

   Session info documents describe key properties of a SIP session such
   as the media streams used in the session.  Session info documents are
   typically created based on a session description expressed using
   Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] or an SDP offer/answer
   pair [RFC3264].

   Session info documents can be used for session-specific policies
   [RFC6794].  In this usage, a UA creates a session info document based
   on its session description(s) and sends this document to the policy
   server.  The policy server modifies this document according to the
   policies that apply to the described session and returns a version of



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   the session info document that is compliant to the policies.  For
   example, if video streams are not permissible under current policies
   and the UA submits a session info document that contains a video
   stream, the policy server will disable (i.e., enabled="no") the video
   stream in the session info document that it returns to the UA.

   Session info documents use the <session-info> root element.  They use
   elements described in this section and common elements described in
   Section 6.

   Elements that are only present in session info documents do not
   require merging rules.  If used in the context of session-specific
   policies, session info documents are sent to one policy server at a
   time only; therefore, a UA does not need to merge multiple session
   info documents into one.  A policy server needs to modify a session
   info document it has received according to its policies.  The
   modification of session info documents is determined by the local
   policies of the policy server and is, thus, outside the scope of this
   standard.

   A policy server can completely reject a session by returning a
   session info document with an empty <session-info> element:

      <session-info></session-info>

4.1.  Mapping between SDP and Session Info Documents

   This section specifies how to map information in a session
   description or an SDP offer/answer pair [RFC3264] to session info
   documents.  It also specifies how to map a session info document into
   a session description.  Note that these mapping rules do not include
   rules for all elements that need to be present in a session info
   document or in a session description.  That is, some of those
   elements are generated following their associated general rules
   (e.g., the general rules to generate SDP "v=" and "t=" lines).

   A UA with a session description that needs to create a session info
   document uses the data in the session description and maps it
   following the rules below.  A UA with an SDP offer/answer pair that
   needs to create a session info document uses the data that has been
   agreed in the offer/answer exchange.

   A UA MUST create a separate <stream> element for each "m=" line in a
   session description or SDP offer/answer pair; the order of the
   <stream> elements corresponds to the order of the "m=" lines.  For a
   session description, the UA MUST insert the media type from the "m="
   line into a <media-type> element and MUST create a <codec> element
   for each codec listed in the "m=" line.  For an SDP offer/answer



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 8]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   pair, the UA MUST insert a <codec> element for each of the codecs
   that were agreed upon for the particular stream in the offer/answer
   exchange.  The <codec> elements MUST have 'q' attributes with values
   that decrease with the order the codecs are given in the "m=" line.
   (Other than the ordering restriction, the particular values used are
   not specified by this document.)

   The UA MUST create a <local-host-port> element for each stream using
   the port taken from the "m=" line and the address from the
   corresponding "c=" line of the local session description.  The UA
   SHOULD create a <remote-host-port> element using the port and address
   from the "m=" and "c=" lines for the same stream taken from the
   remote session description if this session description is available.
   (The local SDP is the one sent by the UA; the remote SDP is the one
   received from the remote UA.)

      The <remote-host-port> contains information that may be considered
      sensitive from a privacy standpoint.  A UA configured not to
      disclose that information would not include the <remote-host-port>
      element in its session info documents.

   The numeric value in a "b=CT:..." attribute in a session description
   is used to set the content of a <max-bw> element with the direction
   attribute value corresponding to which SDP contains the "b="
   attribute.

   The numeric value in a "b=AS:..." attribute at the session level in a
   session description is used to set the content of a <max-session-bw>
   element with the direction attribute value corresponding to the SDP
   which contains the "b=" attribute.

   The numeric value in a "b=AS:..." attribute at the media level in a
   media description is used to set the content of a <max-stream-bw>
   element child of the appropriate <stream> element, with the direction
   attribute value corresponding to the SDP which contains the "b="
   attribute.

   An "a=label:..." attribute [RFC4574] is used to set the 'label'
   attribute of the appropriate <stream> element.

   The mapping from a session info document to a session description
   follows the same rules in the reverse direction.

   For any particular "m=" line, the codecs MUST be listed in decreasing
   order of the values of the 'q' attributes of the corresponding
   <codec> elements.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


4.2.  The <session-info> Element

   The <session-info> element describes the properties of a specific SIP
   session.  The <session-info> element MAY contain the optional
   <context> and <streams> elements, and multiple (including zero)
   <max-bw>, <max-session-bw>, <max-stream-bw>, <media-intermediaries>,
   and <qos-dscp> elements, as well as elements from other namespaces.

4.3.  The <streams> Element

   The <streams> element is a container that is used to describe the
   media streams used in a session.  A <streams> element contains zero
   or more <stream> elements.  Each <stream> element describes the
   properties (e.g., media type, codecs, and IP addresses and ports) of
   a single media stream.

4.3.1.  The <stream> Element

   The <stream> element describes a specific media stream.  It contains
   the media type, codecs, and the hostname(s) or IP address(es) and
   port(s) of this stream.

   The hostname(s) or IP address(es) and port number(s) of a stream
   correspond to the ones listed in the session description(s).  A UA
   that generates a <stream> element MUST insert the hostname/port found
   in the local session description for this media stream into the
   local-host-port element.  The UA SHOULD insert the hostname/port of
   the remote session description into the <remote-host-port> element,
   if the remote session description is available to the UA.  If not,
   the UA generates a stream element that only contains the <local-host-
   port> element.

   This element MAY have the direction, label, and enabled attributes
   (see Section 3.3).

   The 'label' attribute is used to identify a specific media stream.
   The value of the label attribute is a token that is unique among all
   <stream> elements in a session-info document and whose syntax is
   defined in [RFC4566].

   The 'enabled' attribute specifies whether or not the user agent is
   allowed to establish a media stream.

   The <stream> element MUST contain one <media-type> element, one or
   more <codec> elements and one <local-host-port> element.  The
   <stream> element MUST contain zero or one <remote-host-port>
   elements.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


4.3.1.1.  The <local-host-port> Element

   The <local-host-port> element contains the hostname or IP address and
   the receiving port number of the media stream in the local session
   description.  The hostname or IP address is separated from the port
   by a ":".  An example is: "host.example.com:49562".

   The hostname or IP address of element is found in the "c=" element
   for the stream in the local session description.  The port number is
   found in the "m=" element.

4.3.1.2.  The <remote-host-port> Element

   The <remote-host-port> element is structured exactly as the <local-
   host-port> element.  However, it identifies the hostname or IP
   address and receiving port number of the media stream in the remote
   session description.

4.4.  The <media-intermediaries> Element

   The <media-intermediaries> element expresses a policy for routing
   media streams through media intermediaries.  The purpose of the
   <media-intermediaries> element is to tell the UA to send media
   streams through a chain of media intermediaries.  The manner in which
   the UA arranges for a media stream to pass through the intermediaries
   depends on the type of intermediary.

   The <media-intermediaries> element is a container that lists all
   media intermediaries to be traversed.  Media intermediaries should be
   traversed in the order in which they appear in this list.  The
   topmost entry should be traversed first, the last entry should be
   traversed last.

   Different types of intermediaries exist.  These intermediaries are
   not necessarily interoperable and it may not be possible to chain
   them in an arbitrary order.  A <media-intermediaries> element SHOULD
   therefore only contain intermediary elements of the same type.

   This element MAY have the 'direction' attribute (see Section 3.3).

   Multiple <media-intermediaries> elements MUST NOT be present in a
   container unless each applies to a different set of streams (e.g.,
   one <media-intermediaries> element for incoming and one for outgoing
   streams).  The <media-intermediaries> element MUST contain one or
   more elements defining a specific media intermediary, such as <fixed-
   intermediary> or <turn-intermediary>.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


      Note: it is not intended that the <media-intermediaries> element
      replace connectivity discovery mechanisms such as Interactive
      Connectivity Establishment (ICE).  Instead of finding media relays
      that provide connectivity, this element defines a policy for media
      intermediaries that should be traversed.  The set of
      intermediaries defined in the <media-intermediaries> element and
      the ones discovered through ICE may overlap but don't have to.

4.4.1.  The <fixed-intermediary> Element

   A fixed intermediary relies on pre-configured forwarding rules.  The
   user agent simply sends media to the first media intermediary listed.
   It can assume that this media intermediary has been pre-configured
   with a forwarding rule for the media stream and knows where to
   forward the packets.  The configuration of forwarding rules in the
   intermediary must be done through other means.

   The contents of a <fixed-intermediary> element MUST be echoed to all
   policy servers that provide policies for a session.  That is, if
   multiple policy servers provide policies for the same session, this
   element needs to be forwarded to all of them, possibly in a second
   round of session-specific policy subscriptions as described in
   [RFC6794] in the "Contacting the Policy Server" section.

   The <fixed-intermediary> element MUST contain one <int-host-port>
   element and MAY contain multiple optional <int-addl-port> elements.

4.4.1.1.  The <int-host-port> Element

   The <int-host-port> element contains the hostname or IP address and
   port number of a media intermediary.  The UA uses this hostname/IP
   address and port to send its media streams to the intermediary.  The
   hostname or IP address is separated from the port by a ":".

   If a protocol uses multiple subsequent ports (e.g., RTP), the lowest
   port number SHOULD be included in the <int-host-port> element.  All
   additional port numbers SHOULD be identified in <int-addl-port>
   elements.

4.4.1.2.  The <int-addl-port> Element

   If a protocol uses multiple subsequent ports (e.g., RTP), the lowest
   port number SHOULD be included in the <int-host-port> element.  All
   additional port numbers SHOULD be identified in <int-addl-port>
   elements.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


4.4.2.  The <turn-intermediary> Element

   The Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [RFC5766] protocol
   provides a mechanism for inserting a relay into the media path.
   Although the main purpose of TURN is NAT traversal, it is possible
   for a TURN relay to perform other media intermediary functionalities.
   The user agent establishes a binding on the TURN server and uses this
   binding to transmit and receive media.

   The <turn-intermediary> element MUST contain one <int-host-port>
   element and MAY contain multiple optional <int-addl-port> elements
   and zero or one each of the <shared-secret>, <user>, and <transport>
   elements.  If no <transport> element is present, UDP is assumed.

4.4.2.1.  The <shared-secret> Element

   The <shared-secret> element contains the shared secret needed to
   authenticate at the media intermediary.

4.4.2.2.  The <user> Element

   The <user> element contains the user ID needed to authenticate to the
   media intermediary.

4.4.2.3.  The <transport> Element

   The <transport> element contains the name of the transport to be used
   for communicating with the TURN server.  This document defines the
   values "tcp" and "udp" for use in the <transport> element.  Other
   specifications may define additional values.

4.4.3.  The <msrp-intermediary> Element

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) Relay Extensions [RFC4976]
   define a means for incorporating relays into the media path of an
   MSRP [RFC4975] session.  MSRP is explicitly designed for a variety of
   purposes, including policy enforcement.

   The <msrp-intermediary> element MUST contain one <msrp-uri> element,
   and may contain zero or one of each of the <shared-secret> and <user>
   elements.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


4.4.3.1.  The <msrp-uri> Element

   The <msrp-uri> element contains a URI that indicates the MSRP server
   to use for an intermediary.  The UA uses this URI to authenticate
   with the MSRP relay, and then uses the URI it learns through that
   authentication process for any MSRP media it sends or receives.  The
   URIs in the <msrp-uri> element MUST have a scheme of "msrps:".

5.  Session Policy Documents

   Session policy documents describe policies for SIP sessions.  Session
   policy documents are independent of any specific session description
   and express general policies for SIP sessions.  A session policy
   document is used to determine if a SIP session is policy-conformant
   and can be used to modify the session, if needed, to conform to the
   described policies.

   Session policy documents can be used to encode session-independent
   policies [RFC6794].  In this usage, a policy server creates a session
   policy document and passes this document to a UA.  The UA applies the
   policies defined to the SIP sessions it is establishing.  For
   example, a session policy document can contain an element that
   prohibits the use of video.  To set up a session that is compliant to
   this policy, a UA does not include the video media type in its SDP
   offer or answer.

   Session policy documents use the <session-policy> root element.  They
   use elements described in this section and common elements described
   in Section 6.

5.1.  Merging Session Policies

   A UA may receive session policy documents from multiple sources;
   multiple session policy documents can be merged into a single session
   policy document that expresses the logical AND of the policies.

5.1.1.  Single Value Selection

   Properties that have a single value (e.g., the maximum bandwidth
   allowed) require that a common value be determined for this property
   during the merging process.  The merging rules for determining this
   value need to be defined individually for each element in the schema
   definition (e.g., select the lowest maximum bandwidth).








Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 14]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


5.1.2.  Merging Sets

   The <media-types-allowed>, <media-types-excluded>, <codecs-allowed>
   and <codecs-excluded> elements are containers that hold a set of
   media-type/codec elements.  The values defined in these containers
   MUST be merged to determine the set of media types/codecs that are
   permissible in a session.  Note that for a particular codec, the
   <mime-parameter> element (see Section 6.2.2) allows identifying a
   particular encoding or profile of the codec.  Therefore, when the
   <mime-parameter> element is present, what is allowed or excluded is
   the particular encoding or profile.  Other encodings or profiles of
   the same codec are unaffected.

   To merge the media-types-* and codecs-* containers, a UA MUST apply
   all containers it has received one after the other to the set of
   media types/codecs it supports.  After applying media-types-*/
   codecs-* elements, the UA has the list of media types/codecs that are
   allowed in a session.  The containers MAY be applied in any order.
   However, each time a container is applied to the set of media types/
   codecs allowed, this set MUST stay the same or be reduced.  Media
   types/codecs cannot be added during this process.

   The following example illustrates the merging process for two data
   sets.  In this example, the UA supports the following set of audio
   codecs: PCMA, PCMU, and G729.  After applying session policy document
   1, the UA removes PCMA as it is disallowed by this policy.  The
   remaining set of codecs is PCMU and G729.  Session policy document 2
   disallows all codecs that are not listed.  After applying this
   policy, the set of codecs allowed is G729.

   Session Policy Document 1:
   <codecs-excluded>
     <codec><media-type-subtype>audio/PCMA</media-type-subtype></codec>
   </codecs-excluded>

   Session Policy Document 2:
   <codecs-allowed>
     <codec><media-type-subtype>audio/PCMA</media-type-subtype></codec>
     <codec><media-type-subtype>audio/G729</media-type-subtype></codec>
   </codecs-allowed>

   It is possible that two session policy documents define non-
   overlapping sets of allowed media types or codecs.  The resulting
   merged set would be empty, which is illegal according to the schema
   definition of the media-type/codec elements.  This constitutes a
   conflict that cannot be resolved automatically.  If these properties
   are enforced by both networks, the UA will not be able to set up a
   session.



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 15]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   The combined set of media types/codecs MUST again be valid and well-
   formed according to the schema definitions.  A conflict occurs if the
   combined property set is not a well-formed document after the merging
   process is completed.

5.1.3.  Local Policy Server Selection

   Some properties require that only values from the local policy server
   are used.  The local policy server is the policy server that is in
   the local domain of the user agent.

   If policy documents are delivered through the configuration framework
   [RFC6080], the value received through a subscription using the
   "local-network" profile-type SHOULD used.  Values received through
   other profile-type subscriptions SHOULD be discarded.

   If policy documents are delivered through the session-specific policy
   mechanism [RFC6794] the value received from the policy server
   identified by the Local Policy Server URI SHOULD used.  Values
   received from other policy servers SHOULD be discarded.

5.2.  The <session-policy> Element

   The <session-policy> element describes a policy that applies to SIP
   sessions.  The <session-policy> element MAY contain the optional
   <context> and <local-ports> elements and multiple (including zero)
   <media-types-allowed>, <media-types-excluded>, <codecs-allowed>,
   <codecs-excluded>, <max-bw>, <max-session-bw>, <max-stream-bw>, and
   <qos-dscp> elements as well as elements from other namespaces.

5.3.  The <media-types-allowed> Element

   The <media-types-allowed> element is a container that is used to
   define the set of media types (e.g., audio, video) that are allowed
   in a session.  All media types that are not listed in this container
   are not permitted in a session.  A specific media type is allowed by
   adding the corresponding <media-type> element to this container.

   This element MAY have the 'direction' and 'visibility' attributes
   (see Section 3.3).

   Multiple <media-types-allowed> elements MUST NOT be present in a
   container element unless each applies to a different set of streams
   (e.g., one <media-types-allowed> element for incoming and one for
   outgoing streams).  The <media-types-allowed> element MUST contain
   zero or more <media-type> elements.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   A <media-types-allowed> element MUST NOT be used in a container that
   contains a <media-types-excluded> element.  The absence of both
   elements in a container indicates no restrictions regarding media
   types.

   Merging of session-policy documents: <media-types-allowed> containers
   are merged as described in "Merging Sets" Section 5.1.2.

5.4.  The <media-types-excluded> Element

   The <media-types-excluded> element is a container that is used to
   define the set of media types (e.g., audio, video) that are not
   permitted in a session.  All media types that are not listed in this
   container are allowed and can be used in a session.  A specific media
   type is excluded from a session by adding the corresponding <media-
   type> element to this container.

   This element MAY have the 'direction' and 'visibility' attributes
   (see Section 3.3).

   Multiple <media-types-excluded> elements MUST NOT be present in a
   container element unless each applies to a different set of streams
   (e.g., one <media-types-excluded> element for incoming and one for
   outgoing streams).  The <media-types-excluded> element MUST contain
   zero or more <media-type> elements.

   A <media-types-excluded> element MUST NOT be used in a container that
   contains a <media-types-allowed> element.  The absence of both
   elements in a container indicates no restrictions regarding media
   types.

   Merging of session-policy documents: <media-types-excluded>
   containers are merged as described in "Merging Sets" Section 5.1.2.

5.5.  The <codecs-allowed> Element

   The <codecs-allowed> element is a container that is used to define
   the set of codecs that may be used in a session.  All codecs not
   listed in the <codecs-allowed> element are disallowed and MUST NOT be
   used in a session.  A policy MUST allow the use of at least one codec
   per media type.  A specific codec is allowed by adding the
   corresponding <codec> element to this container.

   The <codecs-allowed> element MAY have the 'direction' and
   'visibility' attributes (see Section 3.3).

   Multiple <codecs-allowed> elements MUST NOT be present in a container
   element unless each applies to a different set of streams (e.g., one
   <codecs-allowed> element for incoming and one for outgoing streams).
   The <codecs-allowed> element MUST contain zero or more <codec>
   elements.

   A <codecs-allowed> element MUST NOT be used in a container that
   contains a <codecs-excluded> element.  The absence of both elements
   in a container indicates no restrictions regarding codecs.

   Merging of session-policy documents: <codecs-allowed> containers are
   merged as described in "Merging Sets" Section 5.1.2.

5.6.  The <codecs-excluded> Element

   The <codecs-excluded> element is a container that is used to define
   the set of codecs that are disallowed in a session.  All codecs not
   listed in the <codecs-excluded> element are permitted and MAY be used
   in a session.  A specific codec is disallowed by adding the
   corresponding <codec> element to this container.

   The <codecs-excluded> element MAY have the 'direction' and
   'visibility' attributes (see Section 3.3).

   Multiple <codecs-excluded> elements MUST NOT be present in a
   container element unless each applies to a different set of streams
   (e.g., one <codecs-excluded> element for incoming and one for
   outgoing streams).  The <codecs-excluded> element MUST contain zero
   or more <codec> elements.

   A <codecs-excluded> element MUST NOT be used in a container that
   contains a <codecs-allowed> element.  The absence of both elements in
   a container indicates no restrictions regarding codecs.

   Merging of session-policy documents: <codecs-excluded> containers are
   merged as described in "Merging Sets" Section 5.1.2.

5.7.  The <local-ports> Element

   Domains often require that a user agent only uses ports in a certain
   range for media streams.  The <local-ports> element defines a policy
   for the ports a user agent can use for media.  The value of this
   element consists of the decimal representation of a start port number
   and an end port number, separated by a hyphen ("-").  The start/end
   port numbers are the first/last port numbers that can be used, that
   is, the range is inclusive.  The start/end port numbers must be in
   the range 1 to 65535 (inclusive).




Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 18]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   As with other policy elements, there are values of the <local-ports>
   element that allow no sessions.  This happens if the start port
   number is greater than the end port number.

   The default value for <local-ports> is "1-65535".

   This element MAY have the 'visibility' attribute (see Section 3.3).

   Merging of session-policy documents: the permitted ranges specified
   by the two policies are set-intersected.  If the resulting set is
   empty, the resulting <local-ports> element value MUST be any allowed
   value with a start port number greater than the end port number.

6.  Common Media Policy Data Set Elements

   This section describes common XML elements that are used in session
   info and session policy documents to encode the media properties of
   SIP sessions.

6.1.  The <media-type> Element

   The <media-type> element identifies a specific media type.  The value
   of this element MUST be the name of a media type, as defined in
   Section 8.2.1 of [RFC4566], such as audio, video, text, or
   application.

   This element MAY have the 'q' attribute (see Section 3.3).

   If used in a session policy document inside a <media-types-allowed>
   element, the media types defined MAY be used in a session.  If used
   in a session policy document inside a <media-types-excluded> element,
   the media types defined MUST NOT be used in a session.

6.2.  The <codec> Element

   The <codec> element identifies a specific codec.  The content of this
   element MUST be a media type and subtype (e.g., audio/PCMA [RFC4856]
   or video/H263 [RFC4629]), possibly with parameters.

   The <codec> element MAY have the 'q' attribute (see Section 3.3).

   If used in a session policy document inside a <codecs-allowed>
   element, the codec defined MAY be used in a session.  If used in a
   session policy document inside a <codecs-excluded> element, the codec
   defined MUST NOT be used in a session.

   The <codec> element MUST contain one <media-type-subtype> element and
   MAY contain multiple optional <mime-parameter> elements.



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 19]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


6.2.1.  The <media-type-subtype> Element

   The <media-type-subtype> element contains a media type and subtype
   that identifies a media format [RFC4566] (e.g., a codec).  For audio
   and video streams, the value of this element MUST be a media type and
   subtype that is registered as an RTP Payload Type [RFC4855] separated
   by a forward slash ("/"), e.g., audio/PCMA, audio/G726-16 [RFC4856],
   or video/H263 [RFC4629].  For other media types, SDP sometimes
   encodes the actual media format as part of the transport protocol
   field (e.g., TCP/MSRP [RFC4975] and TCP/TLS/BFCP [RFC4583]).  In
   these cases, this element MUST contain the media type and the media
   format part (e.g., message/msrp and application/bfcp).

6.2.2.  The <mime-parameter> Element

   The <mime-parameter> element may be needed for some codecs to
   identify a particular encoding or profile.  The value of this element
   MUST be a name-value pair containing the name and the value of a
   media type parameter for the codec [RFC4855].  The name and value are
   separated by an equals sign ("=").  For example, the parameter
   "profile=0" can be used to specify a specific profile for the codec
   video/H263-2000 [RFC4629].

6.3.  The <max-bw> Element

   The <max-bw> element defines the overall maximum bandwidth in
   kilobits per second (i.e., 1024 bits per second) an entity can/will
   use for media streams at any point in time.  It defines an upper
   limit for the total bandwidth an entity can/will use for the
   transmission of media streams.  The limit corresponds to the sum of
   the maximum session bandwidth of all sessions a UA may set up in
   parallel.

   The bandwidth limit given in the <max-bw> element includes the
   bandwidth needed for lower-layer transport and network protocols
   (e.g., UDP and IP).

   The <max-bw> element MAY have the 'direction' attribute (see
   Section 3.3).

   If used in a <session-policy> element, the <max-bw> element MAY also
   have the 'visibility' attribute (see Section 3.3).

   If the <max-bw> element occurs multiple times in a container element,
   each instance MUST apply to a different set of media streams (i.e.,
   one <max-bw> element for outgoing and one for incoming streams).

   Merging of session-policy documents: the lowest <max-bw> value MUST
   be used.

6.4.  The <max-session-bw> Element

   The <max-session-bw> element defines the maximum bandwidth in
   kilobits per second (i.e., 1024 bits per second) an entity can/will
   use for media streams in the described session.  It defines an upper
   limit for the total bandwidth of a single session.  This limit
   corresponds to the sum of the maximum stream bandwidth of all media
   streams in a session.

   The bandwidth limit given in the <max-session-bw> element includes
   the bandwidth needed for lower-layer transport and network protocols
   (e.g., UDP and IP).

   The <max-session-bw> element MAY have the 'direction' attribute (see
   Section 3.3).

   If used in a <session-policy> element, the <max-session-bw> element
   MAY also have the 'visibility' attribute (see Section 3.3).

   If the <max-session-bw> element occurs multiple times in a container
   element, each instance MUST apply to a different set of media streams
   (i.e., one <max-session-bw> element for outgoing and one for incoming
   streams).

   Merging of session-policy documents: the lowest <max-session-bw>
   value MUST be used.

6.5.  The <max-stream-bw> Element

   The <max-stream-bw> element defines the maximum bandwidth in kilobits
   per second (i.e., 1024 bits per second) an entity can/will use for
   each media stream in the described session.

   The bandwidth limit given in the <max-stream-bw> element includes the
   bandwidth needed as encapsulated in IP (i.e., the RTP, UDP, and IP
   overheads are included).

   The <max-stream-bw> element MAY have the 'direction' and 'media-type'
   attributes (see Section 3.3).

   If used in a <session-policy> element, the <max-stream-bw> element
   MAY also have the visibility attribute (see Section 3.3).

   If used in a <session-info> element, the <max-stream-bw> element MAY
   also have the label attribute.



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 21]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   The media-type attribute is used to define that the <max-stream-bw>
   element only applies to streams of a certain media type (e.g., audio
   streams).

   The <max-stream-bw> element is used to define a bandwidth limit for a
   specific media stream.  The use of this attribute requires that the
   <stream> element that represents the media stream to which this
   bandwidth limit applies also has a 'label' attribute.  A
   <max-stream-bw> element with a 'label' attribute applies only to the
   stream element that has a 'label' attribute with the same value.  If
   no matching <stream> element exists, then the <max-stream-bw> element
   MUST be ignored.

   If the <max-stream-bw> element occurs multiple times in a container
   element, each instance MUST apply to a different set of media streams
   (i.e., one <max-stream-bw> element for outgoing and one for incoming
   streams).

   Merging of session-policy documents: the lowest <max-stream-bw> value
   MUST be used.

6.6.  The <qos-dscp> Element

   The <qos-dscp> element contains a Differentiated Services Codepoint
   (DSCP) [RFC2474] value that should be used to populate the IP DS
   field of media packets.  The <qos-dscp> contains a decimal integer
   value that represents a 6-bit field and therefore ranges from 0 to
   63.

   This element MAY have the 'direction' and 'media-type' attributes
   (see Section 3.3)).

   If used in a <session-policy> element, the <qos-dscp> element MAY
   also have the 'visibility' attribute (see Section 3.3).

   The 'media-type' attribute is used to specify that the <qos-dscp>
   element only applies to streams of a certain media type (e.g., audio
   streams).

   The <qos-dscp> element is optional and MAY occur multiple times
   inside a container.  If the <qos-dscp> element occurs multiple times,
   each instance MUST apply to a different media stream (i.e., one <qos-
   dscp> element for audio and one for video streams).

   Merging of session-policy documents: the local domain of the user
   agent has precedence over other domains and its DSCP value MUST be
   used.  During the merging process, <qos-dscp> element values from
   local policy server selected as described in "Local Policy Server
   Selection" Section 5.1.3 are used.

6.7.  The <context> Element

   The <context> element provides context information about a session
   policy or session information document.

   The <context> element MAY contain multiple <contact> elements and one
   <info> element.  It can also contain optional <policy-server-URI> and
   <token> elements.

   If used in a <session-info> element, the <context> element MAY also
   contain a <request-URI> element.

   Merging of session-policy documents: the resulting <context> element
   MUST be determined by local policy.

6.7.1.  The <policy-server-URI> Element

   The <policy-server-URI> element contains the URI (including the URI
   scheme) of the policy server that has issued this policy.

6.7.2.  The <contact> Element

   The <contact> element contains a URI that is a contact address (e.g.,
   a SIP URI or mailto URI) by which a human representative of the
   issuer of this document can be reached.

6.7.3.  The <info> Element

   The <info> element provides a short textual description of the policy
   or session that should be intelligible to the human user.

6.7.4.  The <request-URI> Element

   The <request-URI> element contains the request-URI (including the URI
   scheme) of the dialog-initiating request of the session.

   The <request-URI> element is only permitted inside <session-info>
   documents and, thus, MUST NOT be included in session policy
   documents.

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


6.7.5.  The <token> Element

   The <token> element provides a mechanism for a policy server to
   return an opaque string to a UA.  Such a string is sometimes needed
   to construct a Policy-ID header that ensures that all policy requests
   concerning a single session are routed to the same policy server.
   The use of this token is described in "A Framework for Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) Session Policies" [RFC6794].  The syntax
   for the token value is defined in Section 4.4.5.1 of RFC 6794
   [RFC6794], which builds on the syntax defined in Section 25.1 of RFC
   3261 [RFC3261].  (Note that the token value is encodable as a SIP URI
   parameter value, although some characters may require escaping).

6.8.  Other Session Properties

   A number of additional elements have been proposed for a media
   property language.  These elements are deemed to be outside the scope
   of this format.  However, they may be defined in extensions of MPDF
   or other profile data sets.

   o  maximum number of streams

   o  maximum number of sessions

   o  maximum number of streams per session

   o  external address and port

   o  media transport protocol

   o  outbound proxy

   o  SIP methods

   o  SIP option tags

   o  SIP transport protocol

   o  body disposition

   o  body format

   o  body encryption

7.  Examples

7.1.  Session Policy Documents

   The following example is a session policy document that allows the
   use of audio and video and prohibits the use of other media types.
   It allows the use of any codec except G.723 and G.729.

  <session-policy xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:mediadataset">
    <context>
   <policy-server-URI>sips:policy@biloxi.example.com</policy-server-URI>
      <contact>sip:policy_manager@example.com</contact>
      <info>Access network policies</info>
    </context>
    <media-types-allowed>
      <media-type>audio</media-type>
      <media-type>video</media-type>
    </media-types-allowed>
    <codecs-excluded>
      <codec>
        <media-type-subtype>audio/G729</media-type-subtype>
      </codec>
      <codec>
        <media-type-subtype>audio/G723</media-type-subtype>
      </codec>
    </codecs-excluded>
  </session-policy>

7.2.  Session Information Documents

   The following examples contain session descriptions and the session
   information documents that represent these sessions.

7.2.1.  Example 1

   In this example, a session info document is created based on one
   session description.  This session info document would be created,
   for example, by a UA that has composed an offer and is now contacting
   a policy server.

   Local session description:

       </stream>
     </streams>
   </session-info>

7.2.2.  Example 2

   In this example, a session info document is created that represents
   two session descriptions (i.e., an offer and answer).  This session
   info document would be created, for example, by a UA that has
   received an answer from another UA and is now contacting a policy
   server.

9.  Security Considerations

   Section 5 of [RFC6794] discusses security aspects related to the
   transfer of session policy information between user agents and policy
   servers, including their authentication and the use of TLS between
   them.  In particular, a UA needs to check the server's certificate
   and only accept policies from severs from which the UA is configured
   to accept policies.  Section 7 of RFC 3470 [RFC3470] provides general
   security considerations regarding the transport of XML documents in
   network protocols.  Session info and session policy information can
   be sensitive information.  The protocol used to distribute session
   info and session policy documents SHOULD ensure authentication,
   confidentiality, and message integrity.  The use of [RFC6795] to
   distribute session info and session policy document meets these
   requirements.



Hilt, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 37]

RFC 6796                  Media Policy Data Set            December 2012


   An attacker could attempt to modify session policy documents that
   were sent to a client so that their processing by the client would be
   more costly (e.g., in terms of merging policies).  The attacker could
   also attempt to create its own fake policy documents and send them to
   the client with the same purpose or in order to get the client to
   comply with those fake policies as part of a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
   attack.  The protocol used to distribute session policy documents
   SHOULD ensure authentication, privacy, and message integrity.  The
   use of [RFC6795] to distribute session policy document meets these
   requirements.

   The <shared-secret> element can contain a shared secret needed to
   authenticate at a media intermediary.  The privacy of documents
   containing this element MUST be preserved when they are sent between
   a server and a UA.  When [RFC6795] is used to distribute these
   documents, encryption as defined in [RFC3261] (i.e., TLS or S/MIME)
   MUST be used.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new media type (application/
   media-policy-dataset+xml), a new RELAX NG schema, and a new XML
   namespace.

10.1.  Media Type Registration

   Media type name: application

   Media subtype name: media-policy-dataset+xml

   Mandatory parameters: none

   Optional parameters: Same as charset parameter of application/xml as
   specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

   Encoding considerations: Same as encoding considerations of
   application/xml as specified in RFC 3023 [RFC3023].

   Security considerations: See Section 10 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023] and
   Section 9 of this specification.

   Interoperability considerations: none.

   Published specification: This document.

   Applications that use this media type: This document type is used to
   convey session description and media policy information between SIP
   user agents and a domain.
