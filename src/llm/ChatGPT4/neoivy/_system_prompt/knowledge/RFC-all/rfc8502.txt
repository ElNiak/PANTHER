1.  Introduction

   In BGP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) is used for distributing routes and Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) is used for forwarding packets across service
   provider networks.

   The procedures for supporting multicast in a BGP/MPLS Layer 3 (L3)
   VPN are specified in [RFC6513].  The procedures for supporting
   multicast in a BGP/MPLS Layer 2 (L2) VPN are specified in [RFC7117].
   Throughout this document, we will use the term "L2L3VpnMCast network"
   to mean a BGP/MPLS L2 and L3 VPN that supports multicast.

   L2L3VpnMCast networks use various transport mechanisms for forwarding
   a packet to all or a subset of Provider Edge (PE) routers across
   service provider networks.  These transport mechanisms are abstracted
   as provider tunnels (P-tunnels).  The type of P-tunnel indicates the
   type of tunneling technology used to establish the P-tunnel.  The
   syntax and semantics of a Tunnel Identifier are determined by the
   corresponding P-tunnel type [RFC6514].  The P-tunnel type and
   P-tunnel identifier together identify a P-tunnel.

   A BGP attribute that specifies information of a P-tunnel is called a
   Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) Tunnel attribute.  The
   PMSI Tunnel attribute is advertised/received by PEs in BGP auto-
   discovery (A-D) routes.  [RFC6514] defines the format of a PMSI
   Tunnel attribute.  The P-tunnel type and the P-tunnel identifier are
   included in the corresponding PMSI Tunnel attribute.

RFC 8502                   L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB              December 2018


   This document describes textual conventions (TCs) and common managed
   objects (MOs) that will be used by other Management Information Base
   (MIB) modules for monitoring and/or configuring L2L3VpnMCast
   networks.

   This document defines two TCs to represent

   (a) the type of a P-tunnel and
   (b) the identifier of a P-tunnel

   The document also defines MOs that will provide the information
   contained in a PMSI Tunnel attribute and corresponding P-tunnel.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms
   described in [RFC6513] [RFC6514] [RFC7117] and other documents that
   they refer to.  Familiarity with multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 VPN, and
   Multicast VPN concepts and/or mechanisms is assumed.  Some terms
   specifically related to this document are explained below.

   PMSI [RFC6513] is a conceptual interface instantiated by a P-tunnel,
   which is a transport mechanism used to deliver multicast traffic.  A
   PE uses it to send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in
   the same VPN.

   There are two kinds of PMSIs: Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI) and Selective
   PMSI (S-PMSI) [RFC6513].  An I-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE
   attached to a particular Multicast VPN to transmit a message to all
   PEs in the same VPN.  An S-PMSI is a PMSI that enables a PE attached
   to a particular Multicast VPN to transmit a message to some of the
   PEs in the same VPN.

   Throughout this document, we will use the term "PMSI" to refer to
   both "I-PMSI" and "S-PMSI".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Summary of MIB Modules

   This document defines two MIB modules: L2L3-VPN-MULTICAST-TC-MIB and
   L2L3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB.

   o  L2L3-VPN-MULTICAST-TC-MIB contains two textual conventions:
      L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType and L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId.
      L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelType provides an enumeration of the
      P-tunnel types.  L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId represents an
      identifier of a P-tunnel.

   o  L2L3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB defines the following table:
      l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable.  An entry in this table
      corresponds to the attribute information of a specific P-tunnel on
      a PE router.  Entries in this table will be used by other MIB
      modules for monitoring and/or configuring an L2L3VpnMCast network.
      The table index uniquely identifies a P-tunnel.  It is composed of
      a type and identifier of a P-tunnel.  The table may also be used
      in conjunction with other MIBs, such as the MPLS Traffic
      Engineering MIB (MPLS-TE-STD-MIB) [RFC3812], to obtain further
      information about a P-tunnel.  It may also be used in conjunction
      with the Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB) [RFC2863] to obtain further
      information about the interface corresponding to a P-tunnel.

4.  Definitions

4.1.  L2L3-VPN-MULTICAST-TC-MIB Object Definitions

   This MIB module makes reference to the following documents:
   [RFC4875], [RFC5015], [RFC6388], [RFC7524], and [RFC7761].

           For Tunnel Type rsvpP2mp(1), the corresponding Tunnel
           Identifier is composed of an Extended Tunnel ID (4 octets in
           IPv4, 16 octets in IPv6), 2 unused (Reserved) octets that of
           value zero, a Tunnel ID (2 octets), and a Point-to-Multipoint
           (P2MP) ID (4 octets).  The size of the corresponding
           L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 12 octets in IPv4
           and 24 octets in IPv6.

           For Tunnel Type ldpP2mp(2), the corresponding Tunnel
           Identifier is the P2MP Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
           Element (RFC 6388).  The size of the corresponding
           L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId object will be 17 octets
           in IPv4 and 29 octets in IPv6.

           For Tunnel Types pimSsm(3), PimAsm(4), and PimBidir(5), the
           corresponding Tunnel Identifier is composed of the source IP
           address and the group IP address.
           The size of the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId
           object will be 8 octets in IPv4 and 32 octets in IPv6.

           For Tunnel Type ingressReplication(6), the Tunnel Identifier
           is the unicast tunnel endpoint IP address of the local PE.
           The size of the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId
           object will be 4 octets in IPv4 and 16 octets in IPv6.

           For Tunnel Type ldpMp2mp(7), the Tunnel Identifier is
           a Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) FEC Element (RFC 6388).
           The size of the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId
           object will be 17 octets in IPv4 and 29 octets in IPv6.

           For Tunnel Type transportTunnel(8), the Tunnel Identifier
           is a tuple of Source PE Address and Local Number,
           which is a number that is unique to the Source PE (RFC 7524).
           Both Source PE Address and Local Number are 4 octets in IPv4
           and 16 octets in IPv6.
           The size of the corresponding L2L3VpnMcastProviderTunnelId

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in these MIB modules that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if
   this MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that
   an intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the objects in these MIB modules may be considered sensitive
   or vulnerable in some network environments.  This includes INDEX
   objects with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, and any indices from
   other modules exposed via AUGMENTS.  It is thus important to control
   even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
   network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:



Zhang & Tsunoda              Standards Track                   [Page 15]

RFC 8502                   L2L3-VPN-MCAST MIB              December 2018


   o  the l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeTable collectively shows the
      P-tunnel network topology and its performance characteristics.
      For instance, l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelAttributeId in this table will
      contain the identifier that uniquely identifies a P-tunnel.  This
      identifier may be composed of source and multicast group IP
      addresses.  l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelPointer and
      l2L3VpnMcastPmsiTunnelIf will point to the corresponding entries
      in other tables containing configuration and/or performance
      information of a P-tunnel and its interface.  If an Administrator
      does not want to reveal this information, then these objects
      should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the "SMI Network Management MGMT
   Codes Internet-standard MIB" registry:

  Name                Description                OBJECT-IDENTIFIER value
