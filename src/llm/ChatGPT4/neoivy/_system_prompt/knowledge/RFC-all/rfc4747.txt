RFC 4747                  Virtual Fabrics MIB              November 2006


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to the Fibre Channel network's Virtual Fabric function.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.
   MIB objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an

RFC 4747                  Virtual Fabrics MIB              November 2006


   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components (including the Fabric, each node, and
   most ports) have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify
   the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an
   address identifier and a WWN.  When a Fabric is in use, the FC
   address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.  Each
   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy,
   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   Virtual Fabrics allow a single physical Fabric to be divided into
   multiple logical Fabrics.  Each Virtual Fabric may be managed
   independently like traditional Fabrics.  Virtual Fabrics are designed
   to achieve a better utilization of a physical infrastructure and to
   isolate events in one Virtual Fabric from affecting other Fabrics.
   When one Core Switch provides switching functions for multiple
   Virtual Fabrics, that Core Switch is modeled as containing multiple
   Virtual Switches, one for each Virtual Fabric.

   Each Virtual Fabric is identified by a 12-bit Virtual Fabric ID
   (VF_ID).  When frames from multiple Virtual Fabrics are transmitted
   over a physical link, the VF_ID carried in a frame's Virtual Fabric
   Tagging Header (VFT_Header) identifies which Virtual Fabric the frame
   belongs to.  The use of VFT_Headers is enabled through an initial
   negotiation exchange between the two connected ports.

4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   This MIB extends beyond [RFC4044] to cover the functionality, in
   Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's Virtual Fabrics
   function.

5.  MIB Overview

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of,
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre
   Channel Virtual Fabric functionality.  (Note that there are no
   definitions in this MIB module of "managed actions" which can be
   invoked via a remote network management protocol such as SNMP.)

RFC 4747                  Virtual Fabrics MIB              November 2006


   The following MIB module has IMPORTS from [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
   [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC4044], and [RFC4439].  In REFERENCE
   clauses, it refers to [FC-SW-4].

5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [RFC4044] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance, for example within the same SNMP context
   ([RFC3411] section 3.3.1).  The t11vfVirtualSwitchTable augments the
   fcmSwitchTable, and the primary index variable of the fcmSwitchTable
   is fcmInstanceIndex.

5.2.  Representing Core and Virtual Switches

   In the presence of Virtual Switches, fcmSwitchTable in RFC4044
   contains a row for each Virtual Switch. fcmSwitchTable,
   t11vfCoreSwitchTable, and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable are complementary.
   The t11vfCoreSwitchTable and t11vfVirtualSwitchTable contain
   information that helps the management client determine which Switches
   are Virtual Switches and how each relates to a Core Switch.  A
   Virtual Switch must reside in a single Core Switch, and a Core Switch
   is defined as a set of entities with the same Core Switch_Name.

   RFC 4044 was defined before Virtual Switches were standard and
   represented only physical Switches, so the RFC 4044 tables were not
   defined as read-create.  With the advent of Virtual Switches, Virtual
   Switches can now be created by administrators, and read-create tables
   are required.  The StorageType of RFC 4044 tables were not defined,
   and StorageTypes used in this MIB should also apply to the RFC 4044
   tables that this MIB augments.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   t11vfCoreSwitchMaxSupported, t11vfVirtualSwitchVfId,
   t11vfCoreSwitchStorageType, t11vfVirtualSwitchStorageType and
   t11vfVirtualSwitchRowStatus

        - the ability to change the configuration of Virtual Fabrics on
          a particular switch.

   t11vfPortTaggingAdminStatus, t11vfLocallyEnabledRowStatus,
   t11vfPortVfId, t11vfPortStorageType and
   t11vfLocallyEnabledStorageType

        - the ability to change the configuration of Virtual Fabrics on
          a port of a particular switch.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   t11vfVirtualSwitchCoreSwitchName, t11vfPortTaggingOperStatus,
   t11vfLocallyEnabledOperStatus,

        - the ability to discover configuration of Virtual Fabrics on a
          virtual switch or a port.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).



Kipp, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 16]

RFC 4747                  Virtual Fabrics MIB              November 2006


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned 147 for the MIB module under the appropriate
   subtree.
