RFC 5509                 IANA SRV Label for SIP               April 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Service Record (SRV) [RFC2782] identifies the host(s) that will
   support particular services.  The DNS is queried for SRV RR in the
   general form:

   _Service._Proto.Name

      Service: the symbolic name of the desired service

      Proto: the protocol of the desired service

      Name: the domain name for which this record is valid

   "Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence" [RFC3861]
   provides guidance for locating the services associated with URIs that
   employ the following two URI schemes [RFC3986]: 'im' for INSTANT
   INBOXes [RFC3860] and 'pres' for PRESENTITIES [RFC3859].

   In order to ensure that the association between "_im" and "_pres" and
   their respective underlying services are deterministic, the IANA has
   created two independent registries: the Instant Messaging SRV
   Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV Protocol Label registry.

   This document defines and registers the "_sip" protocol label in both
   registries so that computer programs can resolve 'im:' and 'pres:'
   URIs down to SIP addresses.

   Moreover, this document explains how the use of SIP for Presence and
   Instant Messaging uses SRV.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  DNS SRV Usage of SIP with 'im' and 'pres' URIs

   Although there are standard procedures for resolving 'im' and 'pres'
   URIs (Section 3 of [RFC3861]), the labels for SIP are not registered.

   Section 5 of [RFC3428] states that if a user agent (UA) is presented
   with an IM URI (e.g., "im:fred@example.com") as the address for an
   instant message, it SHOULD resolve it to a SIP URI, and place the
   resulting URI in the Request-URI of the MESSAGE request before

   sending.

   Following the procedures defined in [RFC3861], in order to resolve
   the IM URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:

   _im._sip.example.com

   Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP service for instant
   messaging at simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of
   _im._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com.  Thus, the instant
   messaging URI im:fred@example.com would resolve to a SIP URI of
   sip:fred@simple.example.com.

   SIP supports both pager [RFC3428] and session [RFC4975] IM mode.
   However, a DNS SRV lookup does not specify which SIP IM mode a domain
   offer.  If the user agent client (UAC) supports both session mode and
   pager mode, it is then suggested to try session mode first; if that
   mode is rejected, the UAC has to be ready to fall back to pager mode.

   Section 5 of [RFC3856] states that procedures defined in [RFC3861]
   are also used to resolve the protocol-independent PRES URI for a
   presentity (e.g., "pres:fred@example.com") into a SIP URI.

   Following the procedures defined in [RFC3861], in order to resolve
   the PRES URI, the UA performs a SRV lookup for:

   _pres._sip.example.com

   Assuming that the example.com domain offers a SIP presence service at
   simple.example.com, this will result in a resolution of
   _pres._sip.example.com. to simple.example.com.  Thus, the protocol-
   independent PRES URI pres:fred@example.com would resolve to a SIP URI
   of sip:fred@simple.example.com.


4.  Security Considerations

   This document merely serves for the registration of DNS SRV labels in
   the appropriate IANA registry.  The document does not specify a
   protocol; therefore, there are no security issues associated with it.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a new SRV protocol label in both the
   Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry and the Presence SRV
   Protocol Label registry.

5.1.  Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label Registration

   "Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence" [RFC3861]
   defines an Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label registry for
   protocols that can provide services that conform to the "_im" SRV
   Service label.  Because SIP is one such protocol, IANA registers the
   "_sip" protocol label in the "Instant Messaging SRV Protocol Label
   Registry", as follows:

   Protocol label:  _sip

   Specification:  RFC 5509

   Description:  Instant messaging protocol label for the use of SIP for
                 Presence and Instant Messaging protocol as defined by
                 [RFC3428].

   Registrant Contact:  Salvatore Loreto <salvatore.loreto@ericsson.com>

5.2.  Presence SRV Protocol Label Registration

   "Address Resolution for Instant Messaging and Presence" [RFC3861]
   defines a Presence SRV Protocol Label registry for protocols that can
   provide services that conform to the "_pres" SRV Service label.
   Because the use of SIP for Presence and Instant Messaging is one such
   protocol, the IANA registers the "_sip" protocol label in the
   "Presence SRV Protocol Label Registry", as follows:

   Protocol label:  _sip

   Specification:  RFC 5509

   Description:  Presence protocol label for the use of SIP for Presence
                 and Instant Messaging protocol as defined by [RFC3856].
