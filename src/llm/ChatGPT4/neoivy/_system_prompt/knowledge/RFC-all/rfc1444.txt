          RFC 1444      Conformance Statements for SNMPv2     April 1993


          1.  Introduction

          A network management system contains: several (potentially
          many) nodes, each with a processing entity, termed an agent,
          which has access to management instrumentation; at least one
          management station; and, a management protocol, used to convey
          management information between the agents and management
          stations.  Operations of the protocol are carried out under an
          administrative framework which defines both authentication and
          authorization policies.

          Network management stations execute management applications
          which monitor and control network elements.  Network elements
          are devices such as hosts, routers, terminal servers, etc.,
          which are monitored and controlled through access to their
          management information.

          Management information is viewed as a collection of managed
          objects, residing in a virtual information store, termed the
          Management Information Base (MIB).  Collections of related
          objects are defined in MIB modules.  These modules are written
          using a subset of OSI's Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
          [1], termed the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [2].

          It may be useful to define the acceptable lower-bounds of
          implementation, along with the actual level of implementation
          achieved.  It is the purpose of this document to define the
          notation used for these purposes.


          1.1.  A Note on Terminology

          For the purpose of exposition, the original Internet-standard
          Network Management Framework, as described in RFCs 1155, 1157,
          and 1212, is termed the SNMP version 1 framework (SNMPv1).
          The current framework is termed the SNMP version 2 framework
          (SNMPv2).

          3.  Mapping of the OBJECT-GROUP macro

          For conformance purposes, it is useful to define a collection
          of related managed objects.  The OBJECT-GROUP macro is used to
          define each such collection of related objects.  It should be
          noted that the expansion of the OBJECT-GROUP macro is
          something which conceptually happens during implementation and
          not during run-time.

          To "implement" an object, a SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent
          role must return a reasonably accurate value for management
          protocol retrieval operations; similarly, if the object is
          writable, then in response to a management protocol set
          operation, a SNMPv2 entity must accordingly be able to
          reasonably influence the underlying managed entity.  If a
          SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role can not implement an
          object, the management protocol provides for the SNMPv2 entity
          to return an exception or error, e.g, noSuchObject [6].  Under
          no circumstances shall a SNMPv2 entity return a value for
          objects which it does not implement -- it must always return
          the appropriate exception or error, as described in the
          protocol specification [6].


          3.1.  Mapping of the OBJECTS clause

          The OBJECTS clause which must be present, is used to name each
          object contained in the conformance group.  Each of the named
          objects must be defined in the same information module as the
          OBJECT-GROUP macro appears, and must have a MAX-ACCESS clause
          value of "read-only", "read-write", or "read-create".


          3.2.  Mapping of the STATUS clause

          The STATUS clause, which must be present, indicates whether
          this definition is current or historic.

          The values "current", and "obsolete" are self-explanatory.


          3.3.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause

          The DESCRIPTION clause, which must be present, contains a
          textual definition of that group, along with a description of





          Case, McCloghrie, Rose & Waldbusser                  [Page 10]





          RFC 1444      Conformance Statements for SNMPv2     April 1993


          any relations to other groups.  Note that generic compliance
          requirements should not be stated in this clause.  However,
          implementation relationships between this group and other
          groups may be defined in this clause.


          3.4.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause

          The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a
          textual cross-reference to a group  defined in some other
          information module.  This is useful when de-osifying a MIB
          module produced by some other organization.


          3.5.  Mapping of the OBJECT-GROUP value

          The value of an invocation of the OBJECT-GROUP macro is the
          name of the group, which is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an
          administratively assigned name.

          3.6.  Usage Example

          Consider how the system group from MIB-II [3] might be
          described:

          systemGroup OBJECT-GROUP
              OBJECTS     { sysDescr, sysObjectID, sysUpTime,
                            sysContact, sysName, sysLocation,
                            sysServices }
              STATUS  current
              DESCRIPTION
                      "The system group defines objects which are common
                      to all managed systems."
              ::= { mibIIGroups 1 }

          According to this invocation, the conformance group named

               { mibIIGroups 1 }

          contains 7 objects.

          4.  Mapping of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro

          The MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro is used to convey a minimum set of
          requirements with respect to implementation of one or more MIB
          modules.  It should be noted that the expansion of the
          MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro is something which conceptually
          happens during implementation and not during run-time.

          A requirement on all "standard" MIB modules is that a
          corresponding MODULE-COMPLIANCE specification is also defined,
          either in the same information module or in a companion
          information module.


          4.1.  Mapping of the STATUS clause

          The STATUS clause, which must be present, indicates whether
          this definition is current or historic.

          The values "current", and "obsolete" are self-explanatory.
          The "deprecated" value indicates that that object is obsolete,
          but that an implementor may wish to support that object to
          foster interoperability with older implementations.


          4.2.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause

          The DESCRIPTION clause, which must be present, contains a
          textual definition of this compliance statement and should
          embody any information which would otherwise be communicated
          in any ASN.1 commentary annotations associated with the
          statement.


          4.3.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause

          The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a
          textual cross-reference to a compliance statement defined in
          some other information module.


          4.4.  Mapping of the MODULE clause

          The MODULE clause, which must be present, is repeatedly used
          to name each MIB module for which compliance requirements are





          Case, McCloghrie, Rose & Waldbusser                  [Page 13]





          RFC 1444      Conformance Statements for SNMPv2     April 1993


          being specified.  Each MIB module is named by its module name,
          and optionally, by its associated OBJECT IDENTIFIER as well.
          The module name can be omitted when the MODULE-COMPLIANCE
          invocation occurs inside a MIB module, to refer to the
          encompassing MIB module.


          4.4.1.  Mapping of the MANDATORY-GROUPS clause

          The MANDATORY-GROUPS clause, which need not be present, names
          the one or more groups within the correspondent MIB module
          which are unconditionally mandatory for implementation.  If a
          SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent role claims compliance to the
          MIB module, then it must implement each and every object
          within each conformance group listed.  That is, if a SNMPv2
          entity returns a noSuchObject exception in response to a
          management protocol get operation [5] for any object within
          any mandatory conformance group for every MIB view, then that
          SNMPv2 entity is not a conformant implementation of the MIB
          module.


          4.4.2.  Mapping of the GROUP clause

          The GROUP clause which need not be present, is repeatedly used
          to name each MIB group which is conditionally mandatory or
          unconditionally optional for compliance to the MIB module.  A
          MIB group named in a GROUP clause must be absent from the
          correspondent MANDATORY-GROUPS clause.

          Conditionally mandatory groups include those which are
          mandatory only if a particular protocol is implemented, or
          only if another group is implemented.  A GROUP clause's
          DESCRIPTION specifies the conditions under which the group is
          conditionally mandatory.

          A MIB group which is named in neither a MANDATORY-GROUPS
          clause nor a GROUP clause, is unconditionally optional for
          compliance to the MIB module.


          4.4.3.  Mapping of the OBJECT clause

          The OBJECT clause which need not be present, is repeatedly
          used to name each MIB object for which compliance has a





          Case, McCloghrie, Rose & Waldbusser                  [Page 14]





          RFC 1444      Conformance Statements for SNMPv2     April 1993


          refined requirement with respect to the MIB module definition.
          The MIB object must be present in one of the conformance
          groups named in the correspondent MANDATORY-GROUPS clause or
          GROUP clauses.


          4.4.3.1.  Mapping of the SYNTAX clause

          The SYNTAX clause, which need not be present, is used to
          provide a refined SYNTAX for the object named in the
          correspondent OBJECT clause.  Note that if this clause and a
          WRITE-SYNTAX clause are both present, then this clause only
          applies when instances of the object named in the
          correspondent OBJECT clause are read.

          Consult Section 10 of [2] for more information on refined
          syntax.


          4.4.3.2.  Mapping of the WRITE-SYNTAX clause

          The WRITE-SYNTAX clause, which need not be present, is used to
          provide a refined SYNTAX for the object named in the
          correspondent OBJECT clause when instances of that object are
          written.

          Consult Section 10 of [2] for more information on refined
          syntax.


          4.4.3.3.  Mapping of the MIN-ACCESS clause

          The MIN-ACCESS clause, which need not be present, is used to
          define the minimal level of access for the object named in the
          correspondent OBJECT clause.  If this clause is absent, the
          minimal level of access is the same as the maximal level
          specified in the correspondent invocation of the OBJECT-TYPE
          macro.  If present, this clause must not specify a greater
          level of access than is specified in the correspondent
          invocation of the OBJECT-TYPE macro.

          The level of access for certain types of objects is fixed
          according to their syntax definition.  These types are:
          conceptual tables and rows, auxiliary objects, and objects
          with the syntax of Counter32, Counter64, or certain types of





          Case, McCloghrie, Rose & Waldbusser                  [Page 15]





          RFC 1444      Conformance Statements for SNMPv2     April 1993


          textual conventions (e.g., RowStatus [6]).  A MIN-ACCESS
          clause should not be present for such objects.

          An implementation is compliant if the level of access it
          provides is greater or equal to the minimal level in the
          MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro and less or equal to the maximal level
          in the OBJECT-TYPE macro.


          4.4.3.4.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause

          The DESCRIPTION clause must be present for each use of the
          GROUP or OBJECT clause.  For an OBJECT clause, it contains a
          textual description of the refined compliance requirement.
          For a GROUP clause, it contains a textual description of the
          conditions under which the group is conditionally mandatory or
          unconditionally optional.


          4.5.  Mapping of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE value

          The value of an invocation of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro is
          an OBJECT IDENTIFIER.  As such, this value may be
          authoritatively used when referring to the compliance
          statement embodied by that invocation of the macro.

          According to this invocation, to claim alignment with the
          compliance statement named

          a system must implement RFC1213's systemGroup and snmpGroup
          conformance groups.  If the system implements any network
          interfaces, then RFC1213's interfacesGroup conformance group
          must be implemented.  Further, if the system implements any of
          the IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, or EGP protocols, then the
          correspondent conformance group in RFC1213 must be
          implemented, if compliance is to be claimed.  Finally,
          although RFC1213 specifies that it makes "protocol sense" for
          the tcpConnState object to be writable, this specification
          allows the system to permit only read-only access and still
          claim compliance.

          5.  Mapping of the AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro

          The AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro is used to convey the
          capabilities present in a SNMPv2 entity acting in an agent
          role.  It should be noted that the expansion of the AGENT-
          CAPABILITIES macro is something which conceptually happens
          during implementation and not during run-time.

          When a MIB module is written, it is divided into units of
          conformance termed groups.  If a SNMPv2 entity acting in an
          agent role claims to implement a group, then it must implement
          each and every object within that group.  Of course, for
          whatever reason, a SNMPv2 entity might implement only a subset
          of the groups within a MIB module.  In addition, the
          definition of some MIB objects leave some aspects of the
          definition to the discretion of an implementor.

          Practical experience has demonstrated a need for concisely
          describing the capabilities of an agent with respect to one or
          more MIB modules.  The AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro allows an
          agent implementor to describe the precise level of support
          which an agent claims in regards to a MIB group, and to bind
          that description to the value of sysObjectID [3] associated
          with the agent, or to the value of an instance of the snmpORID
          object in the snmpORTable [4].  In particular, some objects
          may have restricted or augmented syntax or access-levels.

          If the AGENT-CAPABILITIES invocation is given to a
          management-station implementor, then that implementor can
          build management applications which optimize themselves when
          communicating with a particular agent.  For example, the
          management-station can maintain a database of these
          invocations.  When a management-station interacts with an
          agent, it retrieves the agent's sysObjectID [3].  Based on
          this, it consults the database.  If an entry is found, then
          the management application can optimize its behavior
          accordingly.

          Note that this binding to sysObjectID may not always suffice
          to define all MIB objects to which an agent can provide
          access.  In particular, this situation occurs where the agent
          dynamically learns of the objects it supports.  In these
          cases, the snmpORID column of snmpORTable [4] contains
          information which should be used in addition to sysObjectID.

          RFC 1444      Conformance Statements for SNMPv2     April 1993


          Note that the AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro specifies refinements
          or variations with respect to OBJECT-TYPE macros in MIB
          modules, NOT with respect to MODULE-COMPLIANCE macros in
          compliance statements.


          5.1.  Mapping of the PRODUCT-RELEASE clause

          The PRODUCT-RELEASE clause, which must be present, contains a
          textual description of the product release which includes this
          agent.


          5.2.  Mapping of the STATUS clause

          The STATUS clause, which must be present, indicates whether
          this definition is current or historic.

          The values "current", and "obsolete" are self-explanatory.
          The "deprecated" value indicates that that object is obsolete,
          but that an implementor may wish to support that object to
          foster interoperability with older implementations.


          5.3.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause

          The DESCRIPTION clause, which must be present, contains a
          textual description of this agent.


          5.4.  Mapping of the REFERENCE clause

          The REFERENCE clause, which need not be present, contains a
          textual cross-reference to a capability statement defined in
          some other information module.


          5.5.  Mapping of the SUPPORTS clause

          The SUPPORTS clause, which need not be present, is repeatedly
          used to name each MIB module for which the agent claims a
          complete or partial implementation.  Each MIB module is named
          by its module name, and optionally, by its associated OBJECT
          IDENTIFIER as well.

          5.5.1.  Mapping of the INCLUDES clause

          The INCLUDES clause, which must be present for each use of the
          SUPPORTS clause, is used to name each MIB group associated
          with the SUPPORT clause, which the agent claims to implement.


          5.5.2.  Mapping of the VARIATION clause

          The VARIATION clause, which need not be present, is repeatedly
          used to name each MIB object which the agent implements in
          some variant or refined fashion with respect to the
          correspondent invocation of the OBJECT-TYPE macro.

          Note that the variation concept is meant for generic
          implementation restrictions, e.g., if the variation for an
          object depends on the values of other objects, then this
          should be noted in the appropriate DESCRIPTION clause.


          5.5.2.1.  Mapping of the SYNTAX clause

          The SYNTAX clause, which need not be present, is used to
          provide a refined SYNTAX for the object named in the
          correspondent VARIATION clause.  Note that if this clause and
          a WRITE-SYNTAX clause are both present, then this clause only
          applies when instances of the object named in the
          correspondent VARIATION clause are read.

          Consult Section 10 of [2] for more information on refined
          syntax.


          5.5.2.2.  Mapping of the WRITE-SYNTAX clause

          The WRITE-SYNTAX clause, which need not be present, is used to
          provide a refined SYNTAX for the object named in the
          correspondent VARIATION clause when instances of that object
          are written.

          Consult Section 10 of [2] for more information on refined
          syntax.

          RFC 1444      Conformance Statements for SNMPv2     April 1993


          5.5.2.3.  Mapping of the ACCESS clause

          The ACCESS clause, which need not be present, is used to
          indicate the agent provides less than the maximal level of
          access to the object named in the correspondent VARIATION
          clause.

          The value "not-implemented" indicates the agent does not
          implement the object, and in the ordering of possible values
          is equivalent to "not-accessible".

          The value "write-only" is provided solely for backward
          compatibility, and shall not be used for newly-defined object
          types.  In the ordering of possible values, "write-only" is
          less than "not-accessible".


          5.5.2.4.  Mapping of the CREATION-REQUIRES clause

          The CREATION-REQUIRES clause, which need not be present, is
          used to name the columnar objects of a conceptual row to which
          values must be explicitly assigned, by a management protocol
          set operation, before the agent will allow the instance of the
          status column of that row to be set to `active'.  (Consult the
          definition of RowStatus [6].)

          If the conceptual row does not have a status column (i.e., the
          objects corresponding to the conceptual table were defined
          using the mechanisms in [7,8]), then the CREATION-REQUIRES
          clause, which need not be present, is used to name the
          columnar objects of a conceptual row to which values must be
          explicitly assigned, by a management protocol set operation,
          before the agent will create new instances of objects in that
          row.

          This clause must not present unless the object named in the
          correspondent VARIATION clause is a conceptual row, i.e., has
          a syntax which resolves to a SEQUENCE containing columnar
          objects.  The objects named in the value of this clause
          usually will refer to columnar objects in that row.  However,
          objects unrelated to the conceptual row may also be specified.

          All objects which are named in the CREATION-REQUIRES clause
          for a conceptual row, and which are columnar objects of that
          row, must have an access level of "read-create".

          5.5.2.5.  Mapping of the DEFVAL clause

          The DEFVAL clause, which need not be present, is used to
          provide a refined DEFVAL value for the object named in the
          correspondent VARIATION clause.  The semantics of this value
          are identical to those of the OBJECT-TYPE macro's DEFVAL
          clause.


          5.5.2.6.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION clause

          The DESCRIPTION clause, which must be present for each use of
          the VARIATION clause, contains a textual description of the
          variant or refined implementation.


          5.6.  Mapping of the AGENT-CAPABILITIES value

          The value of an invocation of the AGENT-CAPABILITIES macro is
          an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, which names the value of sysObjectID [3]
          or snmpORID [4] for which this capabilities statement is
          valid.

                      CREATION-REQUIRES { evalString }

              ::= { acmeAgents 1 }


          According to this invocation, an agent with a sysObjectID (or
          snmpORID) value of

               { acmeAgents 1 }

          supports two MIB modules.

          From MIB-II, all conformance groups except the egpGroup
          conformance group are supported.  However, the object
          ipInAddrErrors is not implemented, whilst the objects

               ifAdminStatus
               ifOperStatus
               ipDefaultTTL
               ipRouteType

          have a restricted syntax, and the object

               tcpConnState

          is available only for reading.  Note that in the case of the
          object ipRouteType the set of values which may be read is
          different than the set of values which may be written.
          Finally, when creating a new instance in the atTable, the
          set-request must create an instance of atPhysAddress.

          From the EVAL-MIB, all the objects contained in the
          functionsGroup and expressionsGroup conformance groups are
          supported, without variation.  In addition, creation of new
          instances in the expr table is supported.

          6.  Extending an Information Module

          As experience is gained with a published information module,
          it may be desirable to revise that information module.

          Section 10 of [2] defines the rules for extending an
          information module.  The remainder of this section defines how
          conformance groups, compliance statements, and capabilities
          statements may be extended.


          6.1.  Conformance Groups

          If any non-editorial change is made to any clause of an object
          group then the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value associated with that
          object group must also be changed, along with its associated
          descriptor.


          6.2.  Compliance Definitions

          If any non-editorial change is made to any clause of a
          compliance definition, then the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
          associated with that compliance definition must also be
          changed, along with its associated descriptor.


          6.3.  Capabilities Definitions

          If any non-editorial change is made to any clause of a
          capabilities definition, then the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
          associated with that capabilities definition must also be
          changed, along with its associated descriptor.
