    Elliptic Curve Algorithms for Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
                   Encrypted Key Package Content Type

Abstract

   This document describes the conventions for using several Elliptic
   Curve cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax
   (CMS) encrypted key package content type.  Specifically, it includes
   conventions necessary to implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman
   (ECDH) with EnvelopedData and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
   Algorithm (ECDSA) with SignedData.  This document extends RFC 6033.

RFC 6161      EC Algorithms for CMS Encrypted Key Packages    April 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document describes the conventions for using Elliptic Curve
   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   encrypted key package content type [RFC6032].  Specifically, it
   includes conventions necessary to implement the following CMS content
   types: EnvelopedData [RFC5652] and SignedData [RFC5652].  This
   document amends [RFC6033].  Familiarity with [RFC6033] and [RFC5753]
   is assumed.

   This document does not define any new algorithms; instead, it refers
   to previously defined algorithms.

1.1  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  EnvelopedData

   When key agreement is used, standard (as opposed to cofactor) ECDH
   [RFC6090][RFC5753] MAY be supported.

3.  SignedData

   If an implementation encapsulates EncryptedKeyPackage with SignedData
   [RFC5652], then it MAY support the signature scheme ECDSA
   [RFC6090][RFC5753].

4.  Public Key Sizes

   The easiest way to implement SignedData and EnvelopedData is with
   public key certificates [RFC5280][RFC5480].  If an implementation
   supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST support keys on the P-256 curve.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC5280], [RFC5480], [RFC5652],
   [RFC5753], [RFC6033], and [RFC6090] apply.

              Requirement Levels", BCP 14, RFC 2119, March 1997.
