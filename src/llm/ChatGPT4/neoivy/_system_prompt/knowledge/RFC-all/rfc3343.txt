1. Introduction

   This memo describes a presence service that is built upon the APEX
   [1] "relaying mesh".  The APEX presence service is used to manage
   presence information for APEX endpoints.

   APEX, at its core, provides a best-effort datagram service.  Within
   an administrative domain, all relays must be able to handle messages
   for any endpoint within that domain.  APEX services are logically
   defined as endpoints, but given their ubiquitous semantics they do
   not necessarily need to be associated with a single physical
   endpoint.  As such, they may be provisioned co-resident with each
   relay within an administrative domain, even though they are logically
   provided on top of the relaying mesh, i.e.,

      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
      |   APEX   |     |   APEX   |    |   APEX   |    |         |
      |  access  |     | presence |    |  report  |    |   ...   |
      | service  |     |  service |    | service  |    |         |
      +----------+     +----------+    +----------+    +---------+
           |                |               |               |
           |                |               |               |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                                                                |
   |                            APEX core                           |
   |                                                                |
   +----------------------------------------------------------------+

   That is, applications communicate with an APEX service by exchanging
   data with a "well-known endpoint" (WKE).

   APEX applications communicate with the presence service by exchanging
   data with the well-known endpoint "apex=presence" in the
   corresponding administrative domain, e.g.,
   "apex=presence@example.com" is the endpoint associated with the
   presence service in the "example.com" administrative domain.

   Note that within a single administrative domain, the presence service
   makes use of the APEX access [3] service in order to determine if an
   originator is allowed to view or manage presence information.

2. Use and Management of Presence Information

   Management of presence information falls into three categories:

   o  applications may update the presence information associated with
      an endpoint;

   o  applications may subscribe to receive presence information
      associated with an endpoint; and,

   o  applications may find out who is subscribed to receive presence
      information.

   Each is now described in turn.

2.1 Update of Presence Information

   When an application wants to modify the presence information
   associated with an endpoint, it sends a publish operation to the
   service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <publish publisher='fred@example.com' transID='1'
                         timeStamp='2000-05-14T13:30:00-08:00'>
                    <presence publisher='fred@example.com'
                           lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:02:00-08:00'
                           publisherInfo='http://www.example.com/fred/'>
                        <tuple
                          destination='apex:fred/appl=im@example.com'
                          availableUntil='2000-05-14T14:02:00-08:00' />
                        <tuple destination='mailto:fred@flintstone.com'
                          availableUntil='2525-12-31T23:59:59-08:00' />
                    </presence>
                </publish>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Note that this example uses the "subaddress" convention specified in
   Section 2.2 of [1] (e.g., "fred/appl=im") to denote multiplexing of
   traffic for a particular endpoint.  Of course, popular applications
   may have their own URI method assigned to them (e.g.,
   "im:fred@example.com").

   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  | pres. |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <reply code='250' transID='1' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

2.2 Distribution of Presence Information

   When an application wants to (periodically) receive the presence
   information associated with an endpoint, it sends a subscribe
   operation to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='wilma@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <subscribe publisher='fred@example.com' duration='86400'
                           transID='100' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />






Rose, et al.                  Experimental                      [Page 4]

RFC 3343        The Application Exchange (APEX) Presence      April 2003


   The service immediately responds with a publish operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  | pres. |
                                  |       | -- ok ---------> |  svc. |
                                  +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='wilma@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <publish publisher='fred@example.com' transID='100'
                         timeStamp='2000-05-14T13:30:00-08:00'>
                    <presence publisher='fred@example.com'
                           lastUpdate='2000-05-14T13:02:00-08:00'
                           publisherInfo='http://www.example.com/fred/'>
                        <tuple
                          destination='apex:fred/appl=im@example.com'
                          availableUntil='2000-05-14T14:02:00-08:00' />
                    </presence>
                </publish>
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Subsequently, for up to the specified "duration", the service sends
   new publish operations whenever there are any changes to the
   endpoint's presence information.  If the "duration" is zero-valued, a
   one time poll of the presence information is achieved; otherwise, at
   the end of the "duration", a terminate operation is sent.

   Note that Step 5 of Section 4.4 requires that the "lastUpdate"
   attribute of a presence entry be supplied in order to update that
   entry; accordingly, applications must successfully retrieve a
   presence entry prior to trying to update that entry.  This is usually
   accomplished by subscribing with a zero-valued duration.
   (Regardless, administrators should ensure that applications
   authorized to update a presence entry are also authorized to retrieve
   that entry.)

   Either the subscriber or the service may cancel a subscription by
   sending a terminate operation, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |

2.3 Distribution of Watcher Information

   When an application wants to (periodically) receive notices about
   endpoints that are subscribed to receive presence information, it
   sends a watch operation to the service, e.g.,

       +-------+                  +-------+
       |       | -- data -------> |       |
       | appl. |                  | relay |
       |       | <--------- ok -- |       |
       +-------+                  +-------+

     C: <data content='#Content'>
            <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
            <recipient identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
            <data-content Name='Content'>
                <watch publisher='fred@example.com' duration='86400'
                       transID='2' />
            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   The service immediately responds with a reply operation containing
   the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

                                  +-------+                  +-------+
                                  |       | <------- data -- |       |
                                  | relay |                  | pres. |

   For each current subscriber, the service immediately sends a notify
   operation containing the same transaction-identifier, e.g.,

            </data-content>
        </data>
     S: <ok />

   Subsequently, for up to the specified "duration", the service sends
   new notify operations whenever an application subscribes successfully
   or a subscription is terminated.  If the "duration" is zero-valued, a
   one time poll of the watcher information is achieved; otherwise, at
   the end of the "duration", a terminate operation is sent.

   Either the watcher or the service may cancel the request by sending a

3. Format of Presence Entries

   Each administrative domain is responsible for maintaining a "presence
   entry" for each of its endpoints (regardless of whether those
   endpoints are currently attached to the relaying mesh).

   Section 6 defines the syntax for presence entries.  Each presence
   entry has a "publisher" attribute, a "lastUpdate" attribute, a
   "publisherInfo" attribute, and contains one or more "tuple" elements:

   o  the "publisher" attribute specifies the endpoint associated with
      the presence entry;

   o  the "lastUpdate" attribute specifies the date and time that the
      service last updated the presence entry;

   o  the "publisherInfo" attribute specifies arbitrary information
      about the publisher (using a URI); and,

   o  each "tuple" element specifies information about an entity
      associated with the endpoint.

   Each "tuple" element has a "destination" attribute, an
   "availableUntil" attribute, a "tupleInfo" attribute, and contains
   zero or more "capability" elements:

   o  the "destination" attribute identifies the entity as a URI (e.g.,
      "apex:fred/appl=im@example.com" or "mailto:fred@flintstone.com");

   o  the "availableUntil" attribute specifies the latest date and time
      that the entity is capable of receiving messages;

   o  the "tupleInfo" attribute specifies arbitrary information about
      the entity (using a URI); and,

   o  each "capability" element contains a specification as to the kinds
      of content the entity is capable of receiving.

   Each "capability" element contains arbitrary character data formatted
   according to the standard indicated in the element's "baseline"
   attribute.

4. The Presence Service

   Section 5 contains the APEX service registration for the presence
   service:

   o  Within an administrative domain, the service is addressed using
      the well-known endpoint of "apex=presence".

   o  Section 6 defines the syntax of the operations exchanged with the
      service.

   o  A consumer of the service initiates communications by sending data
      containing the subscribe, watch, or publish operation.

   o  In addition to replying to these operations, the service may also
      initiate communications by sending data containing the terminate,
      publish, or notify operations.

   An implementation of the service must maintain information about both
   presence entries and in-progress operations in persistent storage.

   Consult Section 6.1.1 of [1] for a discussion on the properties of
   long-lived transaction-identifiers.

4.1 Use of XML and MIME

   Section 4.1 of [1] describes how arbitrary MIME content is exchanged
   as a BEEP [2] payload.  For example, to transmit:

       <data content='...'>
            <originator identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
           <recipient identity='fred@example.com' />
       </data>

   where "..." refers to: <reply code='250' transID='1' />

   then the corresponding BEEP message might look like this:

       C: MSG 1 1 . 42 1234
       C: Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="boundary";
       C:               start="<1@example.com>";
       C:               type="application/beep+xml"
       C:
       C: --boundary
       C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       C: Content-ID: <1@example.com>
       C:
       C: <data content='cid:2@example.com'>
       C:     <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
       C:     <recipient identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
       C: </data>
       C: --boundary
       C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       C: Content-ID: <2@example.com>
       C:
       C: <reply code='250' transID='1' />
       C: --boundary--
       C: END

   or this:

       C: MSG 1 1 . 42 1234
       C: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
       C:
       C: <data content='#Content'>
       C:     <originator identity='fred@example.com' />
       C:     <recipient identity='apex=presence@example.com' />
       C:     <data-content Name='Content'>
       C:         <reply code='250' transID='1' />
       C:     </data-content>
       C: </data>
       C: END

4.2 The Subscribe Operation

   When an application wants to (periodically) receive the presence
   information associated with an endpoint, it sends a "subscribe"
   element to the service.

   The "subscribe" element has a "publisher" attribute, a "duration"
   attribute, a "transID" attribute, and no content:

   o  the "publisher" attribute specifies the endpoint associated with
      the presence entry;

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation; and,

   o  the "duration" attribute specifies the maximum number of seconds
      for which the originator is interested in receiving updated
      presence information.

   When the service receives a "subscribe" element, we refer to the
   "publisher" attribute of that element as the "subject", and the
   service performs these steps:

   1. If the subject is outside of this administrative domain, a "reply"
      element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   2. If the subject does not refer to a valid endpoint, a "reply"
      element having code 550 is sent to the originator.

   3. If the subject's access entry does not contain a
      "presence:subscribe" token for the originator, a "reply" element
      having code 537 is sent to the originator.

   4. If the originator already has an in-progress subscribe operation
      for the subject, then the previous subscribe operation is silently
      terminated, and processing continues.

   5. If the "transID" attribute refers to an in-progress subscribe or
      watch operation for the originator, a "reply" element having code
      555 is sent to the originator.

   6.  Otherwise:

      1. A "publish" element, corresponding to the subject's presence
         entry, is immediately sent to the originator.






Rose, et al.                  Experimental                     [Page 13]

RFC 3343        The Application Exchange (APEX) Presence      April 2003


      2. For each endpoint currently watching subscribers to the
         subject's presence information, a "notify" element is
         immediately as sent (c.f., Step 6.3 of Section 4.6).

      3. For up to the amount of time indicated by the "duration"
         attribute of the "subscribe" element, if the subject's presence
         entry changes, an updated "presence" element is sent to the
         originator using the publish operation (Section 4.4).  Finally,
         when the amount of time indicated by the "duration" attribute
         expires, a terminate operation (Section 4.5) is sent to the
         originator.

      Note that if the duration is zero-valued, then the subscribe
      operation is making a one-time poll of the presence information.
      Accordingly, Step 6.3 above does not occur.

   Regardless of whether a "publish" or "reply" element is sent to the
   originator, the "transID" attribute is identical to the value found
   in the "subscribe" element sent by the originator.

4.3 The Watch Operation

   When an application wants to (periodically) receive notices about
   endpoints that are subscribed to receive presence entry, it sends a
   "watch" element to the service.

   The "watch" element has a "publisher" attribute, a "duration"
   attribute, a "transID" attribute, and no content:

   o  the "publisher" attribute specifies the endpoint associated with
      the presence entry;

   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation; and,

   o  the "duration" attribute specifies the maximum number of seconds
      for which the originator is interested in watching subscribers.

   When the service receives a "watch" element, we refer to the
   "publisher" attribute of that element as the "subject", and the
   service performs these steps:

   1. If the subject is outside of this administrative domain, a "reply"
      element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   2. If the subject does not refer to a valid endpoint, a "reply"
      element having code 550 is sent to the originator.




Rose, et al.                  Experimental                     [Page 14]

RFC 3343        The Application Exchange (APEX) Presence      April 2003


   3. If the subject's access entry does not contain a "presence:watch"
      token for the originator, a "reply" element having code 537 is
      sent to the originator.

   4. If the originator already has an in-progress watch operation for
      the subject, then the previous watch operation is silently
      terminated, and processing continues.

   5. If the "transID" attribute refers to an in-progress subscribe or
      watch operation for the originator, a "reply" element having code
      555 is sent to the originator.

   6. Otherwise:

      1. A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

      2. For each endpoint currently subscribing to the subject's
         presence information, a "notify" element is immediately sent to
         the originator (c.f., Section 4.6).

      3. For up to the amount of time indicated by the "duration"
         attribute of the "watch" element, whenever a subscribe
         operation succeeds or a subscription is terminated, a "notify"
         element is sent to the originator.  Finally, when the amount of
         time indicated by the "duration" attribute expires, a terminate
         operation (Section 4.5) is sent to the originator.

      Note that if the duration is zero-valued, then the watch operation
      is making a one-time poll of the presence information.
      Accordingly, Step 6.3 above does not occur.

   Regardless of whether a "notify" or "reply" element is sent to the
   originator, the "transID" attribute is identical to the value found
   in the "presence" element sent by the originator.

4.4 The Publish Operation

   When an application wants to modify the presence entry associated
   with an endpoint, it sends a "publish" element to the service.  In
   addition, the service sends a "publish" element to endpoints that
   have subscribed to see presence information (c.f., Section 4.2).

   The "publish" element has a "publisher" attribute, a "transID"
   attribute, a "timeStamp" attribute, and contains a "presence"
   element:

   o  the "publisher" attribute specifies the endpoint to be associated
      with the presence entry;



Rose, et al.                  Experimental                     [Page 15]

RFC 3343        The Application Exchange (APEX) Presence      April 2003


   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with this operation;

   o  the "timeStamp" attribute specifies the application's notion of
      the current date and time; and,

   o  the "presence" element contains the desired presence entry for the
      endpoint.

   When the service sends a "publish" element, the "transID" attribute
   specifies the transaction-identifier associated with the subscribe
   operation that caused this "publish" element to be sent, and the
   "timeStamp" attribute specifies the service's notion of the current
   date and time.  No reply is sent by the receiving endpoint.

   When the service receives a "publish" element, we refer to the
   "publisher" attribute of that element as the "subject", and the
   service performs these steps:

   1. If the "publisher" attribute of the "publish" element doesn't
      match the "publisher" attribute of the "presence" element
      contained in the "publish" element, a "reply" element having code
      503 is sent to the originator.

   2. If the subject is outside of this administrative domain, a "reply"
      element having code 553 is sent to the originator.

   3. If the subject does not refer to a valid endpoint, a "reply"
      element having code 550 is sent to the originator.

   4. If the subject's access entry does not contain a
      "presence:publish" token for the originator, a "reply" element
      having code 537 is sent to the originator.

   5. If the "lastUpdate" attribute of the "publish" element is not
      semantically identical to the "lastUpdate" attribute of the
      subject's presence entry, a "reply" element having code 555 is
      sent to the originator.  (This allows a simple mechanism for
      atomic updates.)

   6. Otherwise:

      1. The subject's presence entry is updated from the "publish"
         element.

      2. The "lastUpdate" attribute of the presence entry is set to the
         service's notion of the current date and time.

RFC 3343        The Application Exchange (APEX) Presence      April 2003


      3. A "reply" element having code 250 is sent to the originator.

   When sending the "reply" element, the "transID" attribute is
   identical to the value found in the "publish" element sent by the
   originator.

4.5 The Terminate Operation

   When an application no longer wishes to subscribe to presence
   information or to watch endpoints that are subscribed to receive
   presence information, it sends a "terminate" element to the service;
   similarly, when the service no longer considers an application to be
   subscribing or watching, a "terminate" element is sent to the
   application.

   The "terminate" element contains only a "transID" attribute that
   specifies the transaction-identifier associated an in-progress
   subscribe or watch operation.  Section 9.1 of [1] defines the syntax
   for the "terminate" element.

   When the service receives a "terminate" element, it performs these
   steps:

   1. If the transaction-identifier does not refer to a previous
      subscribe or watch operation for the originator, an "error"
      element having code 550 is returned.

   2. Otherwise, the previous subscribe or watch operation for the
      originator is terminated, and a "reply" element having code 250 is
      sent to the originator.

   Note that following a terminate operation, the originator may receive
   further presence or watcher updates.  Although the service will send
   no further updates after processing a terminate operation and sending
   the reply operation, earlier updates may be in transit.

4.6 The Notify Operation

   The service sends a "notify" element to endpoints that are watching
   other endpoints subscribed to presence information (c.f., Section
   4.3).

   The "notify" element has a "subscriber" attribute, a "transID"
   attribute, a "duration" attribute, an "action" attribute, and no
   content:

   o  the "subscriber" attribute specifies the endpoint that is
      subscribed to presence information; and,



Rose, et al.                  Experimental                     [Page 17]

RFC 3343        The Application Exchange (APEX) Presence      April 2003


   o  the "transID" attribute specifies the transaction-identifier
      associated with the watch operation that caused this "notify"
      element to be sent;

   o  the "action" attribute specifies whether a subscription or its
      termination has occurred; and,

   o  if a subscription is being reported, the "duration" attribute
      specifies the requested duration of the subscription.

   No reply is sent by the receiving endpoint.

4.7 The Reply Operation

   While processing operations, the service may respond with a "reply"
   element.  Consult Sections 10.2 and 6.1.2 of [1], respectively, for
   the definition and an exposition of the syntax of the reply element.

7. Security Considerations

   Consult [1]'s Section 11 for a discussion of security issues.

   In addition, timestamps issued by the the presence service may
   disclose location information.  If this information is considered
   sensitive, the special timezone value "-00:00" may be used (after
   converting the local time accordingly).
