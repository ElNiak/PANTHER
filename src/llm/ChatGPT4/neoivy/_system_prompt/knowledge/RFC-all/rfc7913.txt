                   P-Access-Network-Info ABNF Update

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 7315, by modifying the extension-access-
   info part of the P-Access-Network-Info header field Augmented Backus-
   Naur Form (ABNF), and by adding the following 'access-info' header
   field parameter values to the list of 'access-info' header field
   parameter values in the ABNF: 'operator-specific-GI' and
   'utran-sai-3gpp'.  The values are defined in the ABNF but are not
   included in the list.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7315] defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261]
   P-Access-Network-Info header field.

   The header field syntax contains an 'access-info' header field
   parameter, with a set of pre-defined values.  Most pre-defined values
   follow the 'generic-param' rule [RFC3261].  However, currently the
   Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] in [RFC7315] requires new
   values to follow the 'gen-value' rule [RFC3261], which is more
   restrictive than 'generic-param'.  There is no justification for the
   restriction, and new values have already been defined following the
   'generic-param' rule.

   The ABNF also defines the following 'access-info' header field
   parameter values: 'operator-specific-GI' and 'utran-sai-3gpp'.
   However, the values are not included in the list of 'access-info'
   values.

   This document updates Section 5.4 of [RFC7315], by modifying the
   extension-access-info part of the P-Access-Network-Info header field
   ABNF.

   As the P-Access-Network-Info header field is mainly used in networks
   defined by the 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), where new
   values following the 'generic-param' rule have been defined
   [TS.3GPP.24.229], the update is not considered to cause issues with
   backward compatibility.

2.  Update to RFC 7315

   This section updates the ABNF defined in Section 5.4 of RFC 7315, as
   described below:

  Old syntax:

      access-info            = cgi-3gpp / utran-cell-id-3gpp /
                               dsl-location / i-wlan-node-id /
                               ci-3gpp2 / eth-location /
                               ci-3gpp2-femto / fiber-location /
                               np / gstn-location /local-time-zone /
                               dvb-rcs2-node-id / extension-access-info
      np                     = "network-provided"
      extension-access-info  = gen-value

  New syntax:

      access-info            = cgi-3gpp / utran-cell-id-3gpp /
                               dsl-location / i-wlan-node-id /
                               ci-3gpp2 / eth-location /
                               ci-3gpp2-femto / fiber-location /
                               np / gstn-location /local-time-zone /
                               dvb-rcs2-node-id / operator-specific-GI /
                               utran-sai-3gpp / extension-access-info
      np                     = "network-provided"
      extension-access-info  = generic-param

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the P-Access-Network-Info header
   field are defined in [RFC7315].  The ABNF update defined in this
   document does not impact the security considerations.
