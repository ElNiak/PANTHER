            The 'sip-trunking-capability' Link Relation Type

Abstract

   This Informational document defines the 'sip-trunking-capability'
   link relation type that may be used by an enterprise telephony
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) network to retrieve a SIP trunking
   capability set document, which contains the capabilities and
   configuration requirements of an Internet Telephony Service Provider
   (ITSP).  These technical requirements allow for seamless peering
   between SIP-based enterprise telephony networks and the ITSP.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 8288 [RFC8288] defines a way to indicate relationships between
   resources on the Web. This document specifies the 'sip-trunking-
   capability' link relation type according to the rules of RFC 8288.
   Links with this relationship type can be used to exchange capability
   information between potential peer devices.  In the event that
   systems require additional parameters and configuration to negotiate
   communication, a well-known URI can be utilized to deliver
   information to potential peers, including machine-readable
   instructions and parameters needed for peering.

   The 'sip-trunking-capability' link relation type may be used on web
   resources hosted by ITSPs to provide a structured and detailed
   capability set document.  The capability set document [SIP-AUTO-PEER]
   encapsulates a set of characteristics of an ITSP, which when
   retrieved by enterprise telephony network devices allows for
   automated establishment of SIP [RFC3261] trunking between the two
   telephony networks.

2.  The 'sip-trunking-capability' Link Relation Type

   A capability set document is hosted via web resources by the ITSP.  A
   unique location of the document can be preconfigured and provided to
   each peer by the ITSP, or a centrally published resource can be used
   that dynamically generates the capability set document based on one
   or more Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986] determined by
   the peering device.  The capability set document describes the
   configuration parameters required to successfully establish SIP
   trunking between an enterprise and an ITSP network.  The capability
   set document is composed of structured and machine-readable
   parameters that can be converted into configuration data to meet the
   communication requirements of the ITSP.  The need for an enterprise
   telephony network to obtain a capability set document from an ITSP is
   documented in "Automatic Peering for SIP Trunks" [SIP-AUTO-PEER].

3.  Example Usage

   This section provides an example of possible use of the 'sip-
   trunking-capability' relation type.  The enterprise network device
   solicits the location of the capability set document from the well-
   known URI hosted by the ITSP using the WebFinger protocol [RFC7033].
   The following examples include line breaks and indentation for
   clarity.

      GET /.well-known/webfinger?
         resource=acct%3Atrunkent1456%40example.com&
         rel=sip-trunking-capability
         HTTP/1.1
      Host: ssp1.example.com

   The location of the capability set document is returned to the
   network device in the "href" attribute.

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
      Content-Type: application/jrd+json
      {
         "subject" : "acct:trunkent1456@example.com",
         "links" :
         [
            {
               "rel" : "sip-trunking-capability",
               "href" : "https://capserver.ssp1.example.com/capdoc.json"
            }
         ]
      }

   The ITSP may use an authentication framework such as OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] to determine the identity of the enterprise telephony
   network to provide the appropriate capability set document.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the 'sip-trunking-capability' link relation under
   the "Link Relation Types" registry as follows:

   Relation Name:  sip-trunking-capability

   Description:  Refers to a capability set document that defines
      parameters or configuration requirements for automated peering and
      communication-channel negotiation of the Session Initiation
      Protocol (SIP).

   Reference:  RFC 9409

5.  Security Considerations

   The 'sip-trunking-capability' relation type is not known to introduce
   any new security issues not already discussed in RFC 8288 for generic
   use of web-linking mechanisms.  However, it is recommended to
   exercise caution when publishing potentially sensitive capability
   information over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels.  Additional
   security recommendations are outlined in the capability set document
   definition.  See the Security Considerations section in "Automatic
   Peering for SIP Trunks" [SIP-AUTO-PEER].
