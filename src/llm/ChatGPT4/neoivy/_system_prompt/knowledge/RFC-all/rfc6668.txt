                 SHA-2 Data Integrity Verification for
            the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol

Abstract

   This memo defines algorithm names and parameters for use in some of
   the SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms for data integrity
   verification in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.  It also updates RFC
   4253 by specifying a new RECOMMENDED data integrity algorithm.

RFC 6668              Sha2-Transport Layer Protocol            July 2012


1.  Overview and Rationale

   The Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC4251] is a very common protocol for secure
   remote login on the Internet.  Currently, SSH defines data integrity
   verification using SHA-1 and MD5 algorithms [RFC4253].  Due to recent
   security concerns with these two algorithms ([RFC6194] and [RFC6151],
   respectively), implementors and users request support for data
   integrity verification using some of the SHA-2 family of secure hash
   algorithms.

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Data Integrity Algorithms

   This memo adopts the style and conventions of [RFC4253] in specifying
   how the use of new data integrity algorithms are indicated in SSH.

   The following new data integrity algorithms are defined:

   hmac-sha2-256     RECOMMENDED   HMAC-SHA2-256
                                   (digest length = 32 bytes,
                                    key length    = 32 bytes)

   hmac-sha2-512     OPTIONAL      HMAC-SHA2-512
                                   (digest length = 64 bytes,
                                    key length    = 64 bytes)

                          Figure 1

   The Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) mechanism was
   originally defined in [RFC2104] and has been updated in [RFC6151].

   The SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms is defined in
   [FIPS-180-3].

   Sample code for the SHA-based HMAC algorithms are available in
   [RFC6234].  The variants, HMAC-SHA2-224 and HMAC-SHA2-384 algorithms,
   were considered but not added to this list as they have the same
   computational requirements of HMAC-SHA2-256 and HMAC-SHA2-512,
   respectively, and do not seem to be much used in practice.

RFC 6668              Sha2-Transport Layer Protocol            July 2012


   Test vectors for use of HMAC with SHA-2 are provided in [RFC4231].
   Users, implementors, and administrators may choose to put these new
   MACs into the proposal ahead of the REQUIRED hmac-sha1 algorithm
   defined in [RFC4253] so that they are negotiated first.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document augments the MAC Algorithm Names in [RFC4253] and
   [RFC4250].

   IANA has updated the "Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters"
   registry with the following entries:

   MAC Algorithm Name      Reference       Note
   hmac-sha2-256           RFC 6668        Section 2
   hmac-sha2-512           RFC 6668        Section 2

                        Figure 2

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC 4253 [RFC4253] apply to this
   document.

   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
   publications: NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-107 [800-107] and
   NIST SP 800-131A [800-131A] suggest that HMAC-SHA1 and HMAC-SHA2-256
   have a security strength of 128 bits and 256 bits, respectively,
   which are considered acceptable key lengths.

   Many users seem to be interested in the perceived safety of using the
   SHA2-based algorithms for hashing.
