    Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API)
                      Channel Binding Hash Agility

Abstract

   Currently, channel bindings are implemented using an MD5 hash in the
   Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application Programming
   Interface (GSS-API) mechanism (RFC 4121).  This document updates RFC
   4121 to allow channel bindings using algorithms negotiated based on
   Kerberos crypto framework as defined in RFC 3961.  In addition,
   because this update makes use of the last extensible field in the
   Kerberos client-server exchange message, extensions are defined to
   allow future protocol extensions.

1.  Introduction

   With the recently discovered weaknesses in the MD5 hash algorithm
   (see [RFC6151]), there is a need to use stronger hash algorithms.
   The Kerberos Version 5 Generic Security Service Application
   Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanism [RFC4121] uses MD5 to
   calculate channel binding verifiers.  This document specifies an
   update to the mechanism that allows it to create channel binding
   information based on negotiated algorithms.  This will allow
   deploying new algorithms incrementally without breaking
   interoperability with older implementations when new attacks arise in
   the future.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The term "little-endian order" is used for brevity to refer to the
   least-significant-octet-first encoding, while the term "big-endian
   order" is used for the most-significant-octet-first encoding.

3.  Channel Binding Hash Agility

   When generating a channel binding verifier, Bnd, a hash is computed
   from the channel binding fields.  Initiators MUST populate the Bnd
   field in order to maintain interoperability with existing acceptors.
   In addition, initiators MUST populate the extension field (Exts)
   defined below.

3.1.  Structure of the Exts Field

   The 0x8003 GSS checksum has the same structure described in [RFC4121]
   except that the Exts field is now defined; the entire structure of
   the 0x8003 checksum, including the now defined Exts field, follows:

      Octet     Name       Description
      -----------------------------------------------------------------
      0..3      Lgth       Number of octets in Bnd field, represented
                            in little-endian order;  currently contains
                            hex value 10 00 00 00 (16).
      4..19     Bnd        Channel binding information, as described in
                            Section 4.1.1.2 of [RFC4121].
      20..23    Flags      Four-octet context-establishment flags in
                            little-endian order as described in Section
                            4.1.1.1 of [RFC4121].
      24..25    DlgOpt     The delegation option identifier (=1) in
                            little-endian order [optional].  This field
                            and the next two fields are present if and
                            only if GSS_C_DELEG_FLAG is set as described
                            in Section 4.1.1.1 of [RFC4121].
      26..27    Dlgth      The length of the Deleg field in
                            little-endian order [optional].
      28..(n-1) Deleg      KRB_CRED message (n = Dlgth + 28) [optional].
      n..last   Exts       Extensions.

      where Exts is the concatenation of zero, one, or more individual
      extensions, each of which consists of the following, in order:

         type --   big-endian-order unsigned integer, 32 bits, which
                   contains the type of extension
         length -- big-endian-order unsigned integer, 32 bits, which
                   contains the length, in octets, of the extension data
                   encoded as an array of octets immediately following
                   this field
         data --   octet string of extension information

      If multiple extensions are present, then there MUST be at most one
      instance of a given extension type.

3.2.  The Channel Binding Extension

   When channel binding is used, the Exts MUST include the following
   extension:

      data-type 0x00000000

      data-value

         The output obtained by applying the Kerberos V get_mic
         operation [RFC3961] with key usage number 43 to the channel
         binding data as described in [RFC4121], Section 4.1.1.2 (using
         get_mic instead of MD5).  The key used is the sub-session key
         from the authenticator, if it is present; otherwise, the key
         used is the session key from the ticket.  The get_mic algorithm
         is chosen as the "required checksum mechanism" for the
         encryption type of the key used.

   Initiators that are unwilling to use an MD5 hash of the channel
   bindings MUST set the Bnd field to sixteen octets of hex value FF.

4.  Security Considerations

   With this mechanism, initiators get no indication as to whether the
   acceptors check or ignore channel bindings.

   It is up to the application whether or not to enforce the use of
   channel bindings.  [RFC5056] and [RFC5554] give guidance for
   application developers on channel binding usage.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created a new top-level registry titled "Kerberos V GSS-API
   Mechanism Parameters," separate from the existing Kerberos parameters
   registry.  Within this registry, IANA has created a sub-registry of
   "Kerberos V GSS-API Mechanism Extension Types" with four-field
   entries (Type Number, Type Name, Description, and Reference) and,
   initially, a single registration: 0x00000000, "Channel Binding MIC,"
   "Extension for the verifier of the channel bindings," [RFC6542].

   Using the guidelines for allocation as described in [RFC5226], type
   number assignments are as follows:

       0x00000000 - 0x000003FF IETF Review

       0x00000400 - 0xFFFFF3FF Specification Required

       0xFFFFF400 - 0xFFFFFFFF Private Use
