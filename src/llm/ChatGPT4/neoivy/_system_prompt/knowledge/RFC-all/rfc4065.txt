Abstract

   The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol and the
   Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) are experimental protocols designed
   to accelerate IP handover between wireless access routers.  These
   protocols require IANA allocations for ICMP type and options, Stream
   Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) Payload Protocol Identifiers,
   port numbers, and registries for certain formatted message options.
   This document contains instructions to IANA about which allocations
   are required for the Seamoby protocols.  The ICMP subtype extension
   format for Seamoby has been additionally designed so that it can be
   utilized by other experimental mobility protocols, and the SCTP port
   number is also available for other experimental mobility protocols.

1.  Introduction

   The Seamoby Candidate Access Router Discovery (CARD) protocol
   [RFC4066] and the Context Transfer Protocol (CXTP) [RFC4067] are
   experimental protocols designed to accelerate IP handover between
   wireless access routers.  These protocols require IANA allocations
   for ICMP options and type, SCTP Payload Protocol Identifiers, port
   numbers, and the establishment of registries for certain formatted
   message options.  Because the protocols are experimental, there is no
   guarantee that they will ever see widespread deployment in their
   current form.  Consequently, it is prudent to conserve Internet
   numbering resources that might be needed for other protocols that
   could see wider deployment.  This document contains instructions to
   IANA for the Seamoby protocols.  Additionally, the ICMP subtype
   extension format has been designed so that it could be used by other
   experimental mobility protocols.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].
   Allocation policy names Specification Required, IETF Consensus
   Action, and Designated Expert are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2434 [RFC2434].

2.  Common IPv4 and IPv6 Allocations

   IANA has assigned SCTP port numbers 5090 for use by [RFC4066] and
   5091 for use of [RFC4067].  See Section 5.2.1 of [RFC4066] for a
   description of the inter-access router CARD protocol use of SCTP, and
   Section 3.1 of [RFC4067] for a description of the inter-access router
   CXTP use of SCTP.

   messages utilized by experimental mobility protocols such as Seamoby.
   See Section 5.1.1 of [RFC4066] for a description of experimental
   mobility CARD ICMP messages and Section 3.2 of [RFC4067] for the CXTP
   ICMP messages, specified by Seamoby.  See Section 9 of this document
   for a description of the experimental mobility protocol subtype
   format and initial allocations.

   IANA has assigned IPv6 RFC 2461 Neighbor Discovery [RFC2461] option

RFC 4065                Seamoby IANA Allocations               July 2005


5.1.  AVP Type Registry

   The AVP Type Registry allows for future expansion of the CARD AVP
   type space to include new AVPs.  AVP Type codes are 16 bit unsigned
   integers.  See Section 5.1.4 of [RFC4066] for a description of AVPs.

   The registry SHALL be initially populated with the following table:

      AVP Name                            Type Code
      ----------------------------------------------
      RESERVED                                0x00

   Future allocations of AVP type codes will be made through Expert
   Review, as defined in RFC 2434.

5.2.  Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier Registry

   The Layer 2 Access Technology Identifier registry allows the
   registration of type codes to uniquely identify specific access
   technologies in the L2-Type field of the CARD L2 ID sub-option.  L2
   ID codes are 16 bit unsigned integers.  See Section 5.1.3.1 of
   [RFC4066] for a description of the CARD L2 ID sub-option.

   The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table:

      Layer 2 Access Technology            Type Code
      ----------------------------------------------
      RESERVED                                0x00
      IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet)                   0x01
      IEEE 802.11a                            0x02
      IEEE 802.11b                            0x03
      IEEE 802.11g                            0x04
      IEEE 802.15.1(Bluetooth)                0x05
      IEEE 802.15.3                           0x06
      IEEE 802.15.4                           0x07
      IEEE 802.16                             0x08

   Future allocation of Layer 2 Access Technology identifiers will be
   made by the method of Specification Required, as defined in RFC 2434.
   All requests for allocations MUST be accompanied by a reference to a
   technical document in which the design of the Layer 2 access
   technology is described.

6.  Context Transfer Profile Type Registry

   CXTP requires IANA to maintain a registry named the Context Transfer
   Profile Type Registry, which is a registry of context Feature Profile
   Type identifiers.  Feature Profile Type identifiers are 16 bit
   unsigned integers that identify particular types of feature contexts.
   See Section 2.4 of [RFC4067] for a description of how contexts are
   carried in CXTP.

   The registry SHALL initially be populated with the following table:

      Context Profile                      Type Code
      ----------------------------------------------
      RESERVED                                0x00
      IPv6 Multicast Listener Context         0x01

   Future allocations of Feature Profile Type codes will be made through
   Expert Review, as defined in RFC 2434.

7.  Context Transfer Protocol Authorization Token Calculation Algorithm

   In Section 2.5.4 of [RFC4067], CXTP requires an authorization token
   calculation algorithm indicator.  Currently, the only indicator
   defined is 0x1, for HMAC_SHA1.  Additional algorithms may be added by
   the method of Specification Required [RFC2434].

8.  ICMP Experimental Mobility Subtype Format and Registry

   The ICMP Experimental Mobility Type is utilized by CARD and CXTP in
   the following way.  The interpretation of the Code field is as
   defined by the relevant ICMP standard for IPv4 and IPv6, and does not
   change.  The protocols are free to utilize the Code for their own
   purposes.  The ICMP Experimental Mobility Type defines a one octet
   subtype field within the ICMP Reserved field that identifies the
   specific protocol.  The ICMP header for the Experimental Mobility
   Type is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Type      |    Code       |          Checksum             |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Subtype   |              Reserved                         |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |    Options...
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

      Type         For IPv4, 41; for IPv6 150

      Code         As defined by the relevant ICMP specification and
                   free for use by the Experimental Mobility protocol.

      Checksum     ICMP checksum

      Subtype      One octet subtype code identifying the Experimental
                   Mobility protocol

      Reserved     Unless otherwise defined by the Experimental Mobility
                   protocol, set to zero by the sender and ignored by
                   the receiver.

      Options      As defined by the Experimental Mobility protocol.

   IANA SHALL maintain a registry of one octet unsigned integer subtype
   codes for the Experimental Mobility protocols called the Experimental
   Mobility Protocol Subtype Registry.

   Initial allocations in the registry SHALL be established as follows:

   Protocol/Message  Subtype         Reference
   ----------------------------------------------------------
    CARD               0       Section 5.1.1 of [RFC4066]
    CXTP               1       Section 3.2 of [RFC4067]

   Subsequent allocations of subtype codes SHALL be made by the method
   of Specification Required and IESG Review as defined in RFC 2434.

9.  Usage by Other Experimental Mobility Protocols

   The ICMP Experimental Mobility type code is available for other
   experimental mobility protocols to use.  Other experimental mobility
   protocols MAY define additional ICMP messages that use code points
   under the Experimental Mobility ICMP type.
