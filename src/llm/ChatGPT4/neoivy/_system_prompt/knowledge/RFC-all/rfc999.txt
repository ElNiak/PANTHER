   This memo.

998     Lambert      Mar 87      NETBLT:  A Bulk Data Transfer
                                 Protocol

   This document is a description of, and a specification for, the NETBLT
   protocol.  It is a revision of the specification published in RFC-969.
   NETBLT (NETwork BLock Transfer) is a transport level protocol intended
   for the rapid transfer of a large quantity of data between computers.
   It provides a transfer that is reliable and flow controlled, and is
   designed to provide maximum throughput over a wide variety of networks.
   Although NETBLT currently runs on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), it
   should be able to operate on top of any datagram protocol similar in
   function to IP. This document is published for discussion and comment,
   and does not constitute a standard.  The proposal may change and certain
   parts of the protocol have not yet been specified; implementation of this
   document is therefore not advised.  Obsoletes  RFC-969.

997     Reynolds     Mar 87      Internet Numbers

   This memo is an official status report on the network numbers used in
   the Internet community.  As of 1-Mar-87 the Network Information Center
   (NIC) at SRI International has assumed responsibility for assignment of
   Network Numbers and Autonomous System Numbers.  This RFC documents the
   current assignments of these numbers at the time of this transfer of
   responsibility.   Obsoletes RFC-990, 960, 943, 923 and 900.

                                 Procedures

   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the Internet community and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  This RFC is the
   outgrowth of a series of IAB Privacy Task Force meetings and of internal
   working papers distributed for those meetings.  This RFC defines message
   encipherment and authentication procedures, as the initial phase of an
   effort to provide privacy enhancement services for electronic mail
   transfer in the Internet. It is intended that the procedures defined
   here be compatible with a wide range of key management approaches,
   including both conventional (symmetric) and public-key (asymmetric)
   approaches for encryption of data encrypting keys.  Use of conventional
   cryptography for message text encryption and/or authentication is
   anticipated.

988     Deering      Jul 86      Host Extensions for IP Multicasting

   This memo specifies the extensions required of a host implementation of
   the Internet Protocol (IP) to support internetwork multicasting.  This
   specification supersedes that given in RFC-966, and constitutes a
   proposed protocol standard for IP multicasting in the ARPA-Internet.
   The reader is directed to RFC-966 for a discussion of the motivation and
   rationale behind the multicasting extension specified here.

987     Kille        Jun 86      Mapping between X.400 and RFC-822

   The X.400 series protocols have been defined by CCITT to provide an
   Interpersonal Messaging Service (IPMS), making use of a store and
   forward Message Transfer Service.  It is expected that this standard
   will be implemented very widely.  This document describes a set of
   mappings which will enable interworking between systems operating the
   X.400 protocols and systems using RFC-822 mail protocol or protocols
   derived from RFC-822.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.

986     Callon       Jun 86      Working Draft -- Guidelines for the Use
                                 of Internet-IP addressing in the ISO
                                 Connectionless-Mode Network Protocol

   This RFC suggests a method to allow the existing IP addressing,
   including the IP protocol field, to be used for the ISO Connectionless
   Network Protocol (CLNP).  This is a draft solution to one of the
   problems inherent in the use of "ISO-grams" in the DOD Internet.
   Related issues will be discussed in subsequent RFCs.  This RFC suggests
   a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests
   discussion and suggestions for improvements.

985     Mills        May 86      Requirements for Internet Gateways

   This RFC summarizes the requirements for gateways to be used on networks
   supporting the DARPA Internet protocols.  While it applies specifically
   to National Science Foundation research programs, the requirements are
   stated in a general context and are believed applicable throughout the
   Internet community.  The purpose of this document is to present guidance
   for vendors offering products that might be used or adapted for use in
   an Internet application.  It enumerates the protocols required and gives
   references to RFCs and other documents describing the current
   specification.

984     Clark        May 86      PCMAIL: A Distributed Mail System for
                                 Personal Computers

   This document is a preliminary discussion of the design of a
   personal-computer-based distributed mail system.  Pcmail is a
   distributed mail system that provides mail service to an arbitrary
   number of users, each of which owns one or more personal computers
   (PCs).  The system is divided into two halves.  The first consists of a
   single entity called the "repository".  The repository is a storage
   center for incoming mail.  Mail for a Pcmail user can arrive externally
   from the Internet or internally from other repository users.  The
   repository also maintains a stable copy of each user's mail state.  The
   repository is therefore typically a computer with a large amount of disk
   storage. It is published for discussion and comment, and does not
   constitute a standard.  As the proposal may change, implementation of
   this document is not advised.   See RFC-993.

                                 TCP

   This memo describes a proposed protocol standard for the ARPA Internet
   community.  The CCITT and the ISO have defined various session,
   presentation, and application recommendations which have been adopted by
   the international community and numerous vendors.  To the largest extent
   possible, it is desirable to offer these higher level services directly
   in the ARPA Internet, without disrupting existing facilities.  This
   permits users to develop expertise with ISO and CCITT applications which
   previously were not available in the ARPA Internet.  The intention is
   that hosts in the ARPA-Internet that choose to implement ISO TSAP
   services on top of the TCP be expected to adopt and implement this
   standard.  Suggestions for improvement are encouraged.

                                 (DSP) of the ISO Standard NSAP Address

   This RFC is a draft working document of the ANSI "Guidelines for the
   Specification of the Structure of the Domain Specific Part (DSP) of the
   ISO Standard NSAP Address".  It provides guidance to private address
   administration authorities on preferred formats and semantics for the
   Domain Specific Part (DSP) of an NSAP address.  This RFC specifies the
   way in which the DSP may be constructed so as to facilitate efficient
   address assignment.  This RFC is for informational purposes only and its
   distribution is unlimited and does not specify a standard of the
   ARPA-Internet.

981     Mills        Mar 86      An Experimental Multiple-Path Routing
                                 Algorithm

   This document introduces wiretap algorithms, a class of experimental,
   multiple routing algorithms that compute quasi-optimum routes for
   stations sharing a packet-radio broadcast channel.  The primary route (a
   minimum-distance path), and additional paths ordered by distance, which
   serve as alternate routes should the primary route fail, are computed.
   This prototype is presented as an example of a class of routing
   algorithms and data-base management techniques that may find wider
   application in the Internet community.  Discussions and suggestions for
   improvements are welcomed.

980     Jacobsen     Mar 86      Protocol Document Order Information

   This RFC indicates how to obtain various protocol documents used in the
   DARPA research community.  Included is an overview of the new 1985 DDN
   Protocol Handbook and available sources for obtaining related documents
   (such as DOD, ISO, and CCITT).

979     Malis        Mar 86      PSN End-to-End Functional Specification

   This memo is an updated version of BBN Report 5775, "End-to-End
   Functional Specification and describes important changes to the
   functionality of the interface between a Host and the PSN, and should be
   carefully reviewed by anyone involved in supporting a host on either the
   ARPANET or MILNET".  The new End-to-End protocol (EE) is being developed
   in order to correct a number of deficiencies in the old EE, to improve
   its performance and overall throughput, and to better equip the Packet
   Switch Node (PSN, also known as the IMP) to support its current and
   anticipated host population.

978     Reynolds     Feb 86      Voice File Interchange Protocol (VFIP)

   systems in the ARPA-Internet community.  Suggestions for improvement are
   encouraged.

977     Kantor       Feb 86      Network News Transfer Protocol

   NNTP specifies a protocol for the distribution, inquiry, retrieval, and
   posting of news articles using a reliable stream-based transmission of
   news among the ARPA-Internet community.  NNTP is designed so that news
   articles are stored in a central database allowing a subscriber to
   select only those items he wishes to read.  Indexing, cross-referencing,
   and expiration of aged messages are also provided. This RFC suggests a
   proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests
   discussion and suggestions for improvements.

976     Horton       Feb 86      UUCP Mail Interchange Format Standard

   This document defines the standard format for the transmission of mail
   messages between computers in the UUCP Project.  It does not however,
   address the format for storage of messages on one machine, nor the lower
   level transport mechanisms used to get the date from one machine to the
   next.  It represents a standard for conformance by hosts in the UUCP
   zone.

   This RFC proposes enhancements to the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) to
   support a simple, multiple-level routing capability while preserving the
   robustness features of the current EGP model.  The enhancements
   generalize the concept of core system to include multiple communities of
   autonomous systems, called autonomous confederations.  Discussion and

972     Wancho       Jan 86      Password Generator Protocol

   This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet community.  The
   Password Generator Service (PWDGEN) provides a set of six randomly
   generated eight-character "words" with a reasonable level of
   pronounceability, using a multi-level algorithm.  Hosts on the ARPA

   expected to adopt and implement this standard.

971     DeSchon      Dec 85      A Survey of Data Representation
                                 Standards

   This RFC is a comparison of several data representation standards that
   are currently in use.  The standards discussed are the CCITT X.409
   recommendation, the NBS Computer Based Message System (CBMS) standard,
   DARPA Multimedia Mail system, the Courier remote procedure call
   protocol, and the SUN Remote Procedure Call package.  No proposals in
   this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this
   time.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to
   the appropriate approach to a data representation standard, leading
   eventually to the adoption of an ARPA-Internet standard.

                                 Storage

   The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on a particular problem
   in the ARPA-Internet and possible methods of solution.  Most prior work
   on congestion in datagram systems focuses on buffer management.  In this
   memo the case of a packet switch with infinite storage is considered.
   Such a packet switch can never run out of buffers.  It can, however,
   still become congested.  The meaning of congestion in an
   infinite-storage system is explored.  An unexpected result is found that
   shows a datagram network with infinite storage, first-in-first-out
   queuing, at least two packet switches, and a finite packet lifetime
   will, under overload, drop all packets.  By attacking the problem of
   congestion for the infinite-storage case, new solutions applicable to
   switches with finite storage may be found.  No proposed solutions this
   document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet at this time.

   and servers.  NTP is built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which
   provides a connectionless transport mechanism.  It is evolved from the
   Time Protocol and the ICMP Timestamp message and is a suitable
   replacement for both.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the

                                 Synchronization

   This RFC discusses some experiments in clock synchronization in the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  One of the services frequently neglected in computer
   network design is a high-quality, time-of-day clock capable of
   generating accurate timestamps with small errors compared to one-way
   network delays.  Such a service would be useful for tracing the progress
   of complex transactions, synchronizing cached data bases, monitoring
   network performance and isolating problems.  In this memo one such clock
   service design will be described and its performance assessed.  This
   design has been incorporated as an integral part of the network routing
   and control protocols of the Distributed Computer Network (DCnet)
   architecture.

                                 Clocks

   This RFC discussed clock synchronization algorithms for the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  The recent interest within the Internet community in
   determining accurate time from a set of mutually suspicious network
   clocks has been prompted by several occasions in which errors were found
   in usually reliable, accurate clock servers after thunderstorms which
   disrupted their power supply.  To these sources of error should be added
   those due to malfunctioning hardware, defective software and operator
   mistakes, as well as random errors in the mechanism used to set and
   synchronize clocks.  This report suggests a stochastic model and
   algorithms for computing a good estimator from time-offset samples
   measured between clocks connected via network links.  Included in this
   report are descriptions of certain experiments which give an indication
   of the effectiveness of the algorithms.

955     Braden       Sep 85      Towards a Transport Service for
                                 Transaction Processing Applications

   The DoD Internet protocol suite includes two alternative transport
   service protocols, TCP and UDP, which provide virtual circuit and
   datagram service, respectively.  These two protocols represent points in
   the space of possible transport service attributes which are quite "far
   apart".  We want to examine an important class of applications, those
   which perform what is often called "transaction processing".  We will
   see that the communication needs for these applications fall into the
   gap "between" TCP and UDP -- neither protocol is very appropriate.
   This RFC is concerned with the possible design of one or more new
   protocols for the ARPA-Internet, to support kinds of applications which
   are not well supported at present.  The RFC is intended to spur

951     Croft        Sep 85      Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)

   This RFC describes an IP/UDP bootstrap protocol (BOOTP) which allows a
   diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a
   server host, and the name of a file to be loaded into memory and
   executed.  The bootstrap operation can be thought of as consisting of
   TWO PHASES.  This RFC describes the first phase, which could be labeled
   `address determination and bootfile selection'.  After this address and
   filename information is obtained, control passes to the second phase of
   the bootstrap where a file transfer occurs.  The file transfer will
   typically use the TFTP protocol, since it is intended that both phases
   reside in PROM on the client.  However BOOTP could also work with other
   protocols such as SFTP or FTP.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol
   for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
   for improvements.

950     Mogul        Aug 85      Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure

   This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which
   are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network.  For
   administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to
   divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a
   set of Internet network numbers.  This memo specifies procedures for the
   use of subnets.  These procedures are for hosts (e.g., workstations).
   The procedures used in and between subnet gateways are not fully
   described.  Important motivation and background information for a
   subnetting standard is provided in RFC-940.  This RFC specifies a
   protocol for the ARPA-Internet community.  If subnetting is implemented
   it is strongly recommended that these procedures be followed.

946     Nedved       May 85      Telnet Terminal Location Number Option

   Many systems provide a mechanism for finding out where a user is logged
   in from usually including information about telephone extension and
   office occupants names.  The information is useful for physically
   locating people and/or calling them on the phone.  In 1982 CMU designed
   and implemented a terminal location database and modified existing
   network software to handle a 64-bit number called the Terminal Location
   Number (or TTYLOC).  It now seems appropriate to incorporate this
   mechanism into the TCP-based network protocol family.  The mechanism is
   not viewed as a replacement for the Terminal Location Telnet Option
   (SEND-LOCATION) but as a shorthand mechansim for communicating terminal
   location information between hosts in a localized community.  This RFC
   proposes a new option for Telnet for the ARPA-Internet community, and

   Several sites now contain a complex of local links connected to the
   Internet via a gateway.  The details of the internal connectivity are of
   little interest to the rest of the Internet.  One way of organizing
   these local complexes of links is to use the same strategy as the
   Internet uses to organize networks, that is, to declare each link to be
   an entity (like a network) and to interconnect the links with devices
   that perform routing functions (like gateways).  This general scheme is
   called subnetting, the individual links are called subnets, and the
   connecting devices are called subgateways (or bridges, or gateways).
   This RFC discusses standardizing the protocol used in subnetted
   environments in the ARPA-Internet.

                                 Scheme

   There have been several proposals for schemes to allow the use of a
   single Internet network number to refer to a collection of physical
   networks under common administration which are reachable from the rest
   of the Internet by a common route.  Such schemes allow a simplified view
   of an otherwise complicated topology from hosts and gateways outside of
   this collection.  They allow the complexity of the number and  type of
   these networks, and routing to them, to be localized.  Additions and
   changes in configuration thus cause no detectable change, and no
   interruption of service, due to slow propagation of routing and other
   information outside of the local environment.  These schemes also
   simplify the administration of the network, as changes do not require
   allocation of new network numbers for each new cable installed.  This
   proposal discusses an alternative scheme, one that has been in use at
   the University of California, Berkeley since April 1984.  This RFC
   suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

   This memo concerns itself with message forwarding.  Forwarding can be
   thought of as encapsulating one or more messages inside another.
   Although this is useful for transfer of past correspondence to new
   recipients, without a decapsulation process (which this memo terms
   "bursting"), the forwarded messages are of little use to the recipients
   because they can not be distributed, forwarded, replied-to, or otherwise
   processed as separate individual messages. In order to burst a message
   it is necessary to know how the component messages were encapsulated in
   the draft.  At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest
   group digests.  This RFC proposes a proposed protocol for the
   ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for

925     Postel       Oct 84      Multi-LAN Address Resolution

   The problem of treating a set of local area networks (LANs) as one
   Internet network has generated some interest and concern.  It is
   inappropriate to give each LAN within an site a distinct Internet
   network number.  It is desirable to hide the details of the
   interconnections between the LANs within an site from people, gateways,
   and hosts outside the site.  The question arises on how to best do this,
   and even how to do it at all.  In RFC-917 Jeffery Mogul makes a case for
   the use of "explicit subnets" in a multi-LAN environment.  The explicit
   subnet scheme is a call to recursively apply the mechanisms the Internet
   uses to manage networks to the problem of managing LANs within one
   network.  In this note I urge another approach: the use of "transparent
   subnets" supported by a multi-LAN extension of the Address Resolution
   Protocol.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

921     Postel       Oct 84      Domain Name System Implementation
                                 Schedule - Revised

   This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Domain
   Style Naming System in the Internet.  This memo is an update of RFC-881,
   and RFC-897.  This is an official policy statement of the IAB and the
   DARPA.  The intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for the
   implementation for the Domain Style Naming System.  The explanation of
   how this system works is to be found in the references.

920     Postel       Oct 84      Domain Requirements

   This memo states the requirements on establishing a Domain, and
   introduces the limited set of top level domains.  This memo is a policy
   statement on the requirements of establishing a new domain in the
   ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.  This is an official
   policy statement of the IAB and the DARPA.

919     Mogul        Oct 84      Broadcasting Internet Datagrams

   This RFC proposes simple rules for broadcasting Internet datagrams on
   local networks that support broadcast, for addressing broadcasts, and
   for how gateways should handle them.  This RFC suggests a proposed
   protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and
   suggestions for improvements.

918     Reynolds     Oct 84      Post Office Protocol (POP)

   This RFC suggests a simple method for workstations to dynamically access
   mail from a mailbox server.  The intent of the Post Office Protocol
   (POP) is to allow a user's workstation to access mail from a mailbox
   server.  It is expected that mail will be posted from the workstation to
   the mailbox server via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).  This
   RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and

   requests discussion and suggestions for improvement.  The status of this
   protocol is experimental, and this protocol is dependent upon TCP.

917     Mogul        Oct 84      Internet Subnets

   This memo discusses subnets and proposes procedures for the use of
   subnets, including approaches to solving the problems that arise,
   particularly that of routing.  A subnet of an Internet network is a
   logically visible sub-section of a single Internet network.  For
   administrative or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to
   divide one Internet network into several subnets, instead of acquiring a
   set of Internet network numbers.  This RFC suggests a proposed protocol
   for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions
   for improvements.

916     Finn         Oct 84      Reliable Asynchronous Transfer Protocol
                                 (RATP)

   This RFC suggests a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community,
   and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. This paper
   proposes and specifies a protocol which allows two programs to reliably
   communicate over a communication link.  It ensures that the data entering
   one end of the link if received arrives at the other end intact and
   unaltered.  The protocol, named RATP, is designed to operate over a full
   duplex point-to-point connection.  It contains some features which tailor
   it to the RS-232 links now in common use.

915     Elvy         Dec 84      Network Mail Path Service

   This RFC proposed a new service for the ARPA-Internet community and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  The network mail
   path service fills the current need of people to determine mailbox
   addresses for hosts that are not part of the ARPA-Internet but can be
   reached by one or more relay hosts that have Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP)
   mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail, BITNET mail, etc.  Anyone can use the
   service if they have TCP/TELENET to one of the hosts with a mail path server.

914     Farber       Sep 84      A Thinwire Protocol

   This RFC focuses discussion on the particular problems in the
   ARPA-Internet of low speed network interconnection with personal
   computers, and possible methods of solution.  None of the proposed
   solutions in this document are intended as standards for the
   ARPA-Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge
   as to the appropriate solution to the problems, leading eventually to
   the adoption of standards.

913     Lottor       Sep 84      Simple File Transfer Protocol

   This memo describes a proposed Simple File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).  It
   fills the need of people wanting a protocol that is more useful than
   TFTP but easier to implement (and less powerful) than FTP.  SFTP
   supports user access control, file transfers, directory listing,
   directory changing, file renaming and deleting.  Discussion of this
   proposal is encouraged, and suggestions for improvements may be sent to
   the author.

912     StJohns      Sep 84      Authentication Service

   This memo describes a proposed authentication protocol for verifying the
   identity of a user of a TCP connection.  Given a TCP port number pair,
   it returns a character string which identifies the owner of that
   connection on the server's system.  Suggested uses include automatic
   identification and verification of a user during an FTP session,
   additional verification of a TAC dial up user, and access verification
   for a generalized network file server.

911     Kirton       Aug 84      EGP Gateway under Berkeley Unix 4.2

   This memo describes an implementation of the Exterior Gateway Protocol
   (EGP) (in that sense it is a status report).  The memo also discusses
   some possible extentions and some design issues (in that sense it is an
   invitation for further discussion).

910     Forsdick     Aug 84      Multimedia Mail Meeting Notes

   This memo is a report on a meeting about the experimental multimedia
   mail system (and in a sense a status report on that experiment).  The
   meeting was held at Bolt Beranek and Newman on 23-24 July 1984 to
   discuss recent progress by groups who are building multimedia mail
   systems and to discuss a variety of issues related to the further
   development of multimedia systems.  Representatives were present from
   BBN, ISI, SRI and Linkabit.

909     Welles       Jul 84      Loader Debugger Protocol

   The Loader Debugger Protocol (LDP) is an application layer protocol for
   loading, dumping, and debugging target machines from hosts in a network
   environment.  This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the
   ARPA-Internet and DARPA research community, and requests discussion and
   suggestions for improvemts.

908     Velten       Jul 84      Reliable Data Protocol

   The Reliable Data Protocol (RDP) is designed to provide a reliable data
   transport service for packet-based applications.  This RFC specifies a
   proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet and DARPA research community,
   and requests discussion and suggestions for improvemts.

907     Storch       Jul 84      Host Access Protocol Specification

   This document specifies the Host Access Protocol (HAP).  Although HAP
   was originally designed as the network-access level protocol for the
   DARPA/DCA sponsored Wideband Packet Satellite Network, it is intended
   that it evolve into a standard interface SATNET and TACNET (aka MATNET)
   as well as the Wideband Network.  HAP is an experimental protocol, and
   will undergo further revision as new capabilities are added and/or
   different satellite networks are suported.  Implementations of HAP
   should be performed in coordination with satellite network development
   and operations personnel.

906     Finlayson    Jun 84      Bootstrap Loading Using TFTP

   It is often convenient to be able to bootstrap a computer system from a
   communications network.  This RFC proposes the use of the IP TFTP
   protocol for bootstrap loading in this case.

   RFC-904 is the specification of the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP).
   This memo updates portions of RFC-888 and RFC-827.  This RFC specifies
   an official protocol of the DARPA community for use between gateways of
   different autonomous systems in the ARPA-Internet.

903     Finlayson    Jun 84      A Reverse Address Resolution Protocol

   This RFC suggests a method for workstations to dynamically find their
   protocol address (e.g., their Internet Address), when they know only
   their hardware address (e.g., their attached physical network address).
   This RFC specifies a proposed protocol for the ARPA Internet community,
   and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.

902     Postel       Jul 84      ARPA-Internet Protocol Policy

   The purpose of this memo is to explain how protocol standards are
   adopted for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research community.  There
   are three important aspects to be discussed:  the process, the
   authority, and the complex relationship between the DARPA community and
   the DDN community.  This memo is a policy statement on how protocols
   become official standards for the ARPA-Internet and the DARPA research
   community.  This is an official policy statement of the ICCB and the
   DARPA.

901     Reynolds     Jun 84      Official ARPA-Internet Protocols

   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols used
   in the ARPA-Internet.  Annotations identify any revisions or changes
   planned.  This memo is an official status report on the protocols used
   in the DARPA research community.  See RFC-991.

900     Reynolds     Jun 84      Assigned Numbers

   This RFC specifies parameter values use in the Internet family of
   protocols, such as network numbers, well known ports, protocol types,
   and version numbers.  This memo is an official status report on the
   protocol parameters used in the Internet protocol system.  See RFC-990
   and 997.
