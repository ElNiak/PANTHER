Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   IEEE Std 1394-1995 is a standard for a High Performance Serial Bus.
   Since 1394 uses a different link-layer addressing method than
   conventional IEEE802/Ethernet, the usage of some fields must be
   clarified to achieve interoperability.  This memo describes the 1394
   specific usage of some fields of DHCP messages.

1. Introduction

   IEEE Std 1394-1995 is a standard for a High Performance Serial Bus.
   IETF IP1394 Working Group specified the method to carry IPv4
   datagrams and 1394 ARP packets over an IEEE1394 network [RFC2734].

   The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [RFC2131] provides a
   framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCP/IP
   network.

   Since 1394 uses a different link-layer addressing method than
   conventional IEEE802/Ethernet, the usage of some fields must be
   clarified to achieve interoperability.  This memo describes the 1394
   specific usage of some fields of DHCP.  See [RFC2131] for the
   mechanism of DHCP and the explanations of each field.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Issues related to 1394 link address

   With conventional link-layer protocols, such as an Ethernet, the
   'chaddr' (client hardware address) field may be used to return a
   reply message from a DHCP server (or relay-agent) to a client.  Since
   a 1394 link address (node_ID) is transient and will not be consistent
   across the 1394 bridge, we have chosen not to put it in the 'chaddr'
   field.  A DHCP client should request that the server sends a
   broadcast reply by setting the BROADCAST flag when 1394 ARP is not
   possible yet.

      Note: In general, the use of a broadcast reply is discouraged, but
      we consider the impact in a 1394 network as a non issue.

3. 1394 specific usage of DHCP message fields

   Following rules should be used when a DHCP client is connected to an
   IEEE1394 network.

   'htype' (hardware address type) MUST be 24 [ARPPARAM].

   'hlen' (hardware address length) MUST be 0.

   The 'chaddr' (client hardware address) field is reserved.  The sender
   MUST set this field to zero, and the recipient and the relay agent
   MUST ignore its value on receipt.

   A DHCP client on 1394 SHOULD set a BROADCAST flag in DHCPDISCOVER and
   DHCPREQUEST messages (and set 'ciaddr' to zero) to ensure that the
   server (or the relay agent) broadcasts its reply to the client.

      Note: As described in [RFC2131], 'ciaddr' MUST be filled in with
      client's IP address during BOUND, RENEWING or REBINDING state,
      therefore, the BROADCAST flag MUST NOT be set.  In these cases,
      the DHCP server unicasts DHCPACK message to the address in
      'ciaddr'. The link address will be resolved by 1394 ARP.

   'client identifier' option MUST be used in DHCP messages from the
   client to the server due to the lack of the 'chaddr'.  'client
   identifier' option may consist of any data.  Because every IP over
   1394 node has an EUI-64 (node unique ID), the EUI-64 makes an obvious
   'client identifier'.  1394 clients SHOULD include an EUI-64
   identifier in the 'client identifier' option. The type value for the
   EUI-64 is 27 [ARPPARAM], and the format is illustrated as follows.

    Code  Len   Type  Client-Identifier
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |  61 |  9  | 27  |           EUI-64 (node unique ID)             |
   +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   Note that the use of other 'client identifier' type, such as a fully
   qualified domain name (FQDN), is not precluded by this memo.

   For more details, see "9.14. Client-identifier" in [RFC2132].

4. Security Considerations

   DHCP currently provides no authentication or security mechanisms.
   Potential exposures to attack are discussed in section 7 of the DHCP
   protocol specification [RFC2131].

   A malicious client can falsify its EUI-64 identifier, thus
   masquerading as another client.
