1.  Introduction

   As a synchronization protocol, IEEE Std 1588-2008 [IEEE1588] is
   widely supported in the carrier networks, industrial networks,
   automotive networks, and many other applications.  It can provide
   high precision time synchronization as fine as nanoseconds.  The
   protocol depends on a Precision Time Protocol (PTP) engine to decide
   its own state automatically, and a PTP transportation layer to carry
   the PTP timing and various quality messages.  The configuration
   parameters and state data sets of IEEE Std 1588-2008 are numerous.

RFC 8575                 YANG Data Model for PTP                May 2019


   According to the concepts described in [RFC3444], IEEE Std 1588-2008
   itself provides an information model in its normative specifications
   for the data sets (in IEEE Std 1588-2008 clause 8).  Some
   standardization organizations, including the IETF, have specified
   data models in MIBs (Management Information Bases) for IEEE Std
   1588-2008 data sets (e.g., [RFC8173] and [IEEE8021AS]).  These MIBs
   are typically focused on retrieval of state data using the Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP); furthermore, configuration of PTP
   data sets is not considered in [RFC8173].

   Some service providers and applications require that the management
   of the IEEE Std 1588-2008 synchronization network be flexible and
   more Internet based (typically overlaid on their transport networks).
   Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another driving factor, which
   demands an improved configuration capability of synchronization
   networks.

   YANG [RFC7950] is a data modeling language used to model
   configuration and state data manipulated by network management
   protocols like the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF)
   [RFC6241].  A small set of built-in data types is defined in
   [RFC7950]; a collection of common data types is also defined in
   [RFC6991].  Advantages of YANG include Internet-based configuration
   capabilities, validation, rollback, and so on.  All of these
   characteristics make it attractive to become another candidate
   modeling language for IEEE Std 1588-2008.

   This document defines a YANG data model for the configuration of IEEE
   Std 1588-2008 devices and clocks as well as retrieval of the state
   data of IEEE Std 1588-2008 clocks.  The data model is based on the
   PTP data sets as specified in [IEEE1588].  The technology-specific
   PTP information (e.g., those specifically implemented by a bridge, a
   router, or a telecom profile) is out of scope of this document.

   The YANG module in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

   When used in practice, network products in support of synchronization
   typically conform to one or more IEEE Std 1588-2008 profiles.  Each
   profile specifies how IEEE Std 1588-2008 is used in a given industry
   (e.g., telecom or automotive) and application.  A profile can require
   features that are optional in IEEE Std 1588-2008, and it can specify
   new features that use IEEE Std 1588-2008 as a foundation.

   The readers are assumed to be familiar with IEEE Std 1588-2008.  It
   is expected that the IEEE Std 1588-2008 YANG module will be used as
   follows:

   -  The IEEE Std 1588-2008 YANG module can be used as is for products
      that conform to one of the default profiles specified in IEEE Std
      1588-2008.

   -  When the IEEE Std 1588 standard is revised (e.g., the IEEE Std
      1588 revision in progress at the time of writing this document),
      it will add some new optional features to its data sets.  The YANG
      module of this document can be revised and extended to support
      these new features.  Moreover, the YANG "revision" MUST be used to
      indicate changes to the YANG module under such a circumstance.

   -  A profile standard based on IEEE Std 1588-2008 may create a
      dedicated YANG module for its profile.  The profile's YANG module
      SHOULD use YANG "import" to import the IEEE Std 1588-2008 YANG
      module as its foundation.  Then the profile's YANG module SHOULD
      use YANG "augment" to add any profile-specific enhancements.

   -  A product that conforms to a profile standard may also create its
      own YANG module.  The product's YANG module SHOULD "import" the
      profile's module, and then use YANG "augment" to add any product-
      specific enhancements.

2.  IEEE Std 1588-2008 YANG Data Model Hierarchy

   This section describes the hierarchy of a YANG module for IEEE Std
   1588-2008; specifically, query and configuration of device-wide or
   port-specific configuration information and clock data sets are
   described.

   Query and configuration of clock information include:

   (Note: The attribute names are consistent with IEEE Std 1588-2008,
   but changed to the YANG style, i.e., using all lowercase, with dashes
   between words.)

   -  Clock data set attributes in a clock node, including the
      following: current-ds, parent-ds, default-ds, time-properties-ds,
      and transparent-clock-default-ds.

   -  Port-specific data set attributes, including the following:
      port-ds and transparent-clock-port-ds.

   As all PTP terminology and PTP data set attributes are described in
   detail in IEEE Std 1588-2008, this document only outlines each of
   them in the YANG module.

   A simplified YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] representing the data model
   is typically used by YANG modules.  This document uses the same tree
   diagram syntax as described in [RFC8340].

2.1.  Interpretations from IEEE 1588 Working Group

   The preceding model and the associated YANG module have some subtle
   differences from the data set specifications of IEEE Std 1588-2008.
   These differences are based on interpretation from the IEEE 1588
   Working Group, and they are intended to provide compatibility with
   future revisions of the IEEE Std 1588 standard.

   In IEEE Std 1588-2008, a physical product can implement multiple PTP
   clocks (i.e., an ordinary, boundary, or transparent clock).  As
   specified in IEEE Std 1588-2008 subclause 7.1, each of the multiple
   clocks operates in an independent domain.  However, the organization
   of multiple PTP domains was not clear in the data sets of IEEE Std
   1588-2008.  This document introduces the concept of a PTP instance,
   which is a PTP implementation in a device (i.e., an OC or BC)
   represented by a specific PTP data set.  Each instance operates in
   exactly one domain.  The instance concept is used exclusively to
   allow for optional support of multiple domains.  The instance number
   has no usage within PTP messages.

   Based on statements in IEEE Std 1588-2008 subclauses 8.3.1 and 10.1,
   most transparent clock products have interpreted the transparent
   clock data sets to reside as a singleton at the root level of the
   managed product, and this YANG data model reflects that location.

RFC 8575                 YANG Data Model for PTP                May 2019


2.2.  Configuration and State

   The information model of IEEE Std 1588-2008 classifies each member in
   PTP data sets as one of the following:

   Configurable:  Writable by management.

   Dynamic:       Read-only to management, and the value is changed by
                  PTP protocol operation.

   Static:        Read-only to management, and the value typically does
                  not change.

   For details on the classification of each PTP data set member, refer
   to the specification of that member in IEEE Std 1588-2008.

   Under certain circumstances, the classification of an IEEE Std 1588
   data set member may change for a YANG implementation, for example, a
   configurable member needs to be changed to read-only.  In such a
   case, an implementation SHOULD choose to return a warning upon
   writing to a read-only member or use the deviation mechanism to
   develop a new deviation model as described in Section 7.20.3 of
   [RFC7950].

   This module imports typedef "interface-ref" from [RFC8343].  Most
   attributes are based on the information model defined in [IEEE1588],
   but their names are adapted to the YANG style of naming.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].  Furthermore, general security considerations of time
   protocols are discussed in [RFC7384].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable, and the involved subtrees that are sensitive include:

   /ptp/instance-list specifies an instance (i.e., PTP data sets) for an
   OC or BC.

   /ptp/transparent-clock-default-ds specifies a default data set for a
   TC.

   /ptp/transparent-clock-port-ds-list specifies a list of port data
   sets for a TC.

   Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   Specifically, an inappropriate configuration of them may adversely
   impact a PTP synchronization network.  For example, loss of
   synchronization on a clock, accuracy degradation on a set of clocks,
   or even break down of a whole synchronization network.

Appendix A.  Transferring YANG Work to the IEEE 1588 WG

   This Appendix is informational.

   This appendix describes a future plan to transition responsibility
   for IEEE Std 1588 YANG modules from the IETF TICTOC Working Group
   (WG) to the IEEE 1588 WG, which develops the time synchronization
   technology that the YANG modules are designed to manage.

   This appendix is forward-looking with regard to future
   standardization roadmaps in the IETF and IEEE.  Since those roadmaps
   cannot be predicted with significant accuracy, this appendix is
   informational, and it does not specify imperatives or normative
   specifications of any kind.

   The IEEE Std 1588-2008 YANG module of this standard represents a
   cooperation between the IETF (for YANG) and IEEE (for 1588).  For the
   initial standardization of IEEE-1588 YANG modules, the information
   model is relatively clear (i.e., IEEE Std 1588 data sets), but
   expertise in YANG is required, making IETF an appropriate location
   for the standards.  The TICTOC WG has expertise with IEEE Std 1588,
   making it the appropriate location within the IETF.

   The IEEE 1588 WG anticipates future changes to its standard on an
   ongoing basis.  As IEEE 1588 WG members gain practical expertise with
   YANG, the IEEE 1588 WG will become more appropriate for
   standardization of its YANG modules.  As the IEEE 1588 standard is
   revised and/or amended, IEEE 1588 members can more effectively
   synchronize the revision of this YANG module with future versions of
   the IEEE 1588 standard.

   This appendix is meant to establish some clear expectations between
   IETF and IEEE about the future transfer of IEEE 1588 YANG modules to
   the IEEE 1588 WG.  The goal is to assist in making the future
   transfer as smooth as possible.  As the transfer takes place, some
   case-by-case situations are likely to arise, which can be handled by
   discussion on the IETF TICTOC WG mailing lists and/or appropriate
   liaisons.

   This appendix obtained insight from [RFC4663], an informational memo
   that described a similar transfer of MIB work from the IETF Bridge
   MIB WG to the IEEE 802.1 WG.

RFC 8575                 YANG Data Model for PTP                May 2019


A.1.  Assumptions for the Transfer

   For the purposes of discussion in this appendix, assume that the IESG
   has approved the publication of an RFC containing a YANG module for a
   published IEEE 1588 standard.  As of this writing, this is IEEE Std
   1588-2008, but it is possible that YANG modules for subsequent 1588
   revisions could be published from the IETF TICTOC WG.  For discussion
   in this appendix, we use the phrase "last IETF 1588 YANG" to refer to
   the most recently published 1588 YANG module from the IETF TICTOC WG.

   The IEEE-SA Standards Board New Standards Committee (NesCom) handles
   new Project Authorization Requests (PARs) (see
   <http://standards.ieee.org/board/nes/>).  PARs are roughly the
   equivalent of IETF Working Group Charters and include information
   concerning the scope, purpose, and justification for standardization
   projects.

   Assume that IEEE 1588 has an approved PAR that explicitly specifies
   development of a YANG module.  The transfer of YANG work will occur
   in the context of this IEEE 1588 PAR.  For discussion in this
   appendix, we use the phrase "first IEEE 1588 YANG" to refer to the
   first IEEE 1588 standard for YANG.

   Assume that as part of the transfer of YANG work, the IETF TICTOC WG
   agrees to cease all work on standard YANG modules for IEEE 1588.

   Assume that the IEEE 1588 WG has participated in the development of
   the last IETF 1588 YANG module, such that the first IEEE 1588 YANG
   module will effectively be a revision of it.  In other words, the
   transfer of YANG work will be relatively clean.

   The actual conditions for the future transfer can be such that the
   preceding assumptions do not hold.  Exceptions to the assumptions
   will need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis at the time of the
   transfer.  This appendix describes topics that can be addressed based
   on the preceding assumptions.

A.2.  Intellectual Property Considerations

   During review of the legal issues associated with transferring Bridge
   MIB WG documents to the IEEE 802.1 WG (Sections 3.1 and 9 of
   [RFC4663]), it was concluded that the IETF does not have sufficient
   legal authority to make the transfer to the IEEE without the consent
   of the document authors.

   If the last IETF 1588 YANG is published as an RFC, the work is
   required to be transferred from the IETF to the IEEE, so that IEEE
   1588 WG can begin working on the first IEEE 1588 YANG.



Jiang, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 26]

RFC 8575                 YANG Data Model for PTP                May 2019


   When work on the first IEEE YANG module begins in the IEEE 1588 WG,
   that work derives from the last IETF YANG module of this RFC,
   requiring a transfer of that work from the IETF to the IEEE.  In
   order to avoid having the transfer of that work be dependent on the
   availability of this RFC's authors at the time of its publication,
   the IEEE Standards Association department of Risk Management and
   Licensing provided the appropriate forms and mechanisms for this
   document's authors to assign a non-exclusive license for IEEE to
   create derivative works from this document.  Those IEEE forms and
   mechanisms will be updated as needed for any future IETF YANG modules
   for IEEE 1588 (the signed forms are held by the IEEE Standards
   Association department of Risk Management and Licensing.).  This will
   help to make the future transfer of work from the IETF to the IEEE
   occur as smoothly as possible.

   As stated in the initial "Status of this Memo", the YANG module in
   this document conforms to the provisions of BCP 78.  The IETF will
   retain all the rights granted at the time of publication in the
   published RFCs.

A.3.  Namespace and Module Name

   As specified in Section 5 "IANA Considerations", the YANG module in
   this document uses IETF as the root of its URN namespace and YANG
   module name.

   Use of IETF as the root of these names implies that the YANG module
   is standardized in a Working Group of IETF, using the IETF processes.
   If the IEEE 1588 Working Group were to continue using these names
   rooted in IETF, the IEEE 1588 YANG standardization would need to
   continue in the IETF.  The goal of transferring the YANG work is to
   avoid this sort of dependency between standards organizations.

   IEEE 802 has an active PAR (IEEE P802d) for creating a URN namespace
   for IEEE use (see <http://standards.ieee.org/develop/
   project/802d.html>).  It is likely that this IEEE 802 PAR will be
   approved and published prior to the transfer of YANG work to the IEEE
   1588 WG.  If so, the IEEE 1588 WG can use the IEEE URN namespace for
   the first IEEE 1588 YANG module, such as:

      urn:ieee:Std:1588:yang:ieee1588-ptp

   where "ieee1588-ptp" is the registered YANG module name in the IEEE.

   Under the assumptions of Appendix A.1, the first IEEE 1588 YANG
   module's prefix will be the same as the last IETF 1588 YANG module's
   prefix (i.e., "ptp").  Consequently, other YANG modules can preserve

   the same import prefix "ptp" to access PTP nodes during the migration
   from the last IETF 1588 YANG module to the first IEEE 1588 YANG
   module.

   The result of these name changes are that for complete compatibility,
   a server (i.e., IEEE 1588 node) can choose to implement a YANG module
   for the last IETF 1588 YANG module (with IETF root) as well as the
   first IEEE 1588 YANG module (with IEEE root).  Since the content of
   the YANG module transferred are the same, the server implementation
   is effectively common for both.

   From a client's perspective, a client of the last IETF 1588 YANG
   module (or earlier) looks for the IETF-rooted module name; and a
   client of the first IEEE 1588 YANG module (or later) looks for the
   IEEE-rooted module name.

A.4.  IEEE 1588 YANG Modules in ASCII Format

   Although IEEE 1588 can certainly decide to publish YANG modules only
   in the PDF format that they use for their standard documents, without
   publishing an ASCII version, most network management systems cannot
   import the YANG module directly from the PDF.  Thus, not publishing
   an ASCII version of the YANG module would negatively impact
   implementers and deployers of YANG modules and would make potential
   IETF reviews of YANG modules more difficult.

   This appendix recommends that the IEEE 1588 WG consider future plans
   for:

   -  Public availability of the ASCII YANG modules during project
      development.  These ASCII files allow IETF participants to access
      these documents for pre-standard review purposes.

   -  Public availability of the YANG portion of published IEEE 1588
      standards, provided as an ASCII file for each YANG module.  These
      ASCII files are intended for use of the published IEEE 1588
      standard.

   As an example of public availability during project development, IEEE
   802 uses the same repository that IETF uses for YANG module
   development (see <https://github.com/YangModels/yang>).  IEEE
   branches are provided for experimental work (i.e., pre-PAR) as well
   as standard work (post-PAR drafts).  IEEE-SA has approved use of this
   repository for project development, but not for published standards.

   As an example of public availability of YANG modules for published
   standards, IEEE 802.1 provides a public list of ASCII files for MIB
   (see <http://www.ieee802.org/1/files/public/MIBs/> and
   <http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/MIBS.html>), and analogous lists are
   planned for IEEE 802.1 YANG files.
