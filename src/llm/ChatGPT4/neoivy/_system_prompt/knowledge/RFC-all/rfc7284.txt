1.  Introduction

   Profiles, as defined by [RFC6906], can be used to signal support for
   additional semantics, such as constraints, conventions, extensions,
   or any other aspects that do not alter the basic media type
   semantics.  Profiles are identified by a URI and can thus be created
   without central coordination.

   Similar to media types and link relation types, it is, in some cases,
   beneficial to centrally manage profile URIs to ensure
   interoperability and decrease the coupling between clients and
   servers.  This allows the independent evolution of clients and
   servers as both are coupled to these central contracts instead of
   being coupled to each other.  Therefore, this document establishes an
   IANA registry for profile URIs.

2.  Registration Process

   All elements in this registry require a URI in order to be
   registered.  The meaning of the profile URI should be documented in a
   permanent and readily available public specification in sufficient
   detail so that interoperability between independent implementations
   is possible (see the registration template in Section 4).

   An example registration request can be found in Section 3.

3.  Example Registration Request

   The following is an example registration request for the profile URI
   http://example.com/profiles/example.

   This is a request to IANA to please register the profile URI
   "http://example.com/profiles/example" in the "Profile URIs" registry
   according [RFC7284].

RFC 7284                The Profile URI Registry               June 2014


   o  Profile URI: http://example.com/profiles/example

   o  Common Name: My Profile

   o  Description: An exemplary profile URI registration.

   o  Reference: [the relevant specification]

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document establishes the "Profile URIs" registry.  The
   registration procedure for new entries requires a request in the form
   of the following template and is "First Come First Served" per
   [RFC5226].  Instructions for a registrant to request the registration
   of a profile URI are in Section 2.

   The underlying registry data (e.g., the XML file) must include
   Simplified BSD License text as described in Section 4.e of the Trust
   Legal Provisions [TRUST].

   The registration template is:

   o  Profile URI: The URI that identifies the registered profile.

   o  Common Name: The name by which the profile being registered is
      generally known.

   o  Description: A relatively short description of the profile.  For
      simple profiles, this might be all the documentation that is
      required and there might be no reference document.  In those
      cases, be sure this description adequately documents the profile
      and is suitable for interoperable implementation.

   o  Reference: Reference to the document that specifies the URI,
      preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a copy of
      the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may also be
      included.  This is recommended but can be left blank if the
      "Description" field provides sufficient documentation.

   o  Notes: [optional]

4.1.  Initial Registry Contents

   The "Profile URIs" registry's initial contents are:

   o  Profile URI: urn:example:profile-uri
   o  Common Name: Exemplary Profile
   o  Description: A profile to be used in examples, in accordance with
      [RFC6963].
   o  Reference: [RFC7284]

   o  Profile URI: http://dublincore.org/documents/2008/08/04/dc-html/
   o  Common Name: Dublin Core HTML metadata profile
   o  Description: A set of conventions by which a Dublin Core metadata
      description set can be can be represented within an (X)HTML web
      page using (X)HTML elements and attributes.
   o  Reference: [DC-HTML]

   o  Profile URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded
   o  Common Name: Expanded JSON-LD
   o  Description: A profile URI to request or signal expanded JSON-LD
      document form.
   o  Reference: [JSON-LD]

   o  Profile URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted
   o  Common Name: Compacted JSON-LD
   o  Description: A profile URI to request or signal compacted JSON-LD
      document form.
   o  Reference: [JSON-LD]

   o  Profile URI: http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened
   o  Common Name: Flattened JSON-LD
   o  Description: A profile URI to request or signal flattened JSON-LD
      document form.
   o  Reference: [JSON-LD]

5.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those already
   inherent to using URIs.  Security considerations for URIs in general
   can be found in [RFC3986].
