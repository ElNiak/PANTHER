        Moving Outdated TCP Extensions and TCP-Related Documents
                  to Historic or Informational Status

Abstract

   This document reclassifies several TCP extensions and TCP-related
   documents that either have been superseded, have never seen
   widespread use, or are no longer recommended for use to "Historic"
   status.  The affected documents are RFCs 675, 721, 761, 813, 816,
   879, 896, 1078, and 6013.  Additionally, this document reclassifies
   RFCs 700, 794, 814, 817, 872, 889, 964, and 1071 to "Informational"
   status.

1.  Introduction

   TCP has a long history.  Over time, many RFCs have accumulated that
   describe aspects of the TCP protocol, implementation, and extensions.
   Some of these have been superseded, are no longer recommended for
   use, or have simply never seen widespread use.

   Sections 6 and 7.1 of the TCP roadmap document [RFC7414] already
   reclassified a number of TCP extensions as "Historic" and describes
   the reasons for doing so, but it did not instruct the RFC Editor to
   change the status of these RFCs in the RFC database.  The purpose of
   this document is to do just that.

   In addition, this document reclassifies all other documents mentioned
   in the TCP roadmap that currently have an "Unknown" status to either
   "Historic" or "Informational".

2.  Status Changes

   The following two sections give a short justification why a specific
   TCP extension or a TCP-related document is being reclassified as
   "Historic" or "Informational".  In addition, the letter code after an
   RFC number indicates from which original status a particular RFC is
   changed to "Historic" or "Informational" (see BCP 9 [RFC2026] for an
   explanation of these categories):

      S - Standards Track (Proposed Standard, Draft Standard, or
      Internet Standard)

      E - Experimental

      I - Informational

      H - Historic

      B - Best Current Practice

      U - Unknown (not formally defined)

   For the content of the documents itself, the reader is referred
   either to the corresponding RFC or, for a brief description, to the
   TCP roadmap document [RFC7414].

2.1.  Moving to "Historic" Status

   This document changes the status of the following RFCs to "Historic"
   [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC675]  U, "Specification of Internet Transmission Control
      Program" was replaced by the final TCP specification [RFC793]

   o  [RFC721]  U, "Out-of-Band Control Signals in a Host-to-Host
      Protocol" was a proposal that was not incorporated into the final
      TCP specification [RFC793]

   o  [RFC761]  U, "DoD Standard Transmission Control Protocol" was
      replaced by the final TCP specification [RFC793]

   o  [RFC813]  U, "Window and Acknowledgement Strategy in TCP" was
      incorporated into [RFC1122]

   o  [RFC816]  U, "Fault Isolation and Recovery" was incorporated into
      [RFC1122] and [RFC5461]





Zimmermann, et al.            Informational                     [Page 3]

RFC 7805          Outdated TCP Extensions and Documents       April 2016


   o  [RFC879]  U, "The TCP Maximum Segment Size and Related Topics" was
      incorporated into [RFC1122] and [RFC6691]

   o  [RFC896]  U, "Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks" was
      incorporated into [RFC1122] and [RFC6633]

   o  [RFC1078] U, "TCP Port Service Multiplexer (TCPMUX)" should be
      deprecated, because:

      *  It modifies the TCP connection establishment semantics by also
         completing the three-way handshake when a service is not
         available.
      *  It requires all new connections to be received on a single
         port, which limits the number of connections between two
         machines.
      *  It complicates firewall implementation and management because
         all services share the same port number.
      *  There are very limited deployments, and these are not used in
         an Internet context.  (The only reported use is for SGI's Data
         Migration Facility in private networks.)

   o  [RFC6013] E, "TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT)" should be
      deprecated (although only published in 2011) because:

      *  It uses the experimental TCP option codepoints, which prohibit
         a large-scale deployment.
      *  [RFC7413] and [TCP-EDO] are alternatives that have more "rough
         consensus and running code" behind them.
      *  There are no known wide-scale deployments.

2.2.  Moving to "Informational" Status

   This document changes the status of the following RFCs to
   "Informational" [RFC2026]:

   o  [RFC700] U, "A Protocol Experiment", which presents a field report
      about the deployment of a very early version of TCP

   o  [RFC794]  U, "Pre-emption", which recommends that operating
      systems need to manage their limited resources, which may include
      TCP connection state

   o  [RFC814]  U, "Name, Addresses, Ports, and Routes", which gives
      guidance on designing tables and algorithms to keep track of
      various identifiers within a TCP/IP implementation

   o  [RFC817]  U, "Modularity and Efficiency in Protocol
      Implementation", which contains general implementation suggestions

RFC 7805          Outdated TCP Extensions and Documents       April 2016


   o  [RFC872]  U, "TCP-on-a-LAN", which concludes that the fear of
      using TCP on a local network is unfounded

   o  [RFC889]  U, "Internet Delay Experiments", which describes
      experiments with the TCP retransmission timeout calculation

   o  [RFC964]  U, "Some Problems with the Specification of the Military
      Standard Transmission Control Protocol", which points out several
      specification bugs in the US Military's MIL-STD-1778 document,
      which was intended as a successor to [RFC793]

   o  [RFC1071] U, "Computing the Internet Checksum", which lists a
      number of implementation techniques for efficiently computing the
      Internet checksum

3.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.  Each RFC
   listed in this document attempts to address the security
   considerations of the specification it contains.
