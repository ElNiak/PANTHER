Abstract

   This RFC marks the 40th anniversary of the RFC document series.

1.  RFCs and Jon Postel

   Forty years ago today, the first Request for Comments document, RFC
   1, was published at UCLA [RFC1].  This was the first of a series that
   currently contains more than 5400 documents (roughly 160,000 pages)
   on computer networking in general and on the Internet protocols in
   particular.  The RFC series emerged from the US government-funded
   research efforts that created the ARPANET and later the Internet.
   When the IETF was formed in the mid-1980s, RFCs became the primary
   publication vehicle for IETF standards, and thus became centered on
   the vendor and user communities.

   For the first 29 years, Jon Postel [Postel] was *the* RFC Editor,
   until his untimely death in October 1998.  Postel, with substantial
   help from Joyce K. Reynolds, was responsible for the collection,
   editing, online publication, and archiving of the RFC documents.
   From 1978 until 1998, Postel was a research scientist at the USC
   Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI) in Marina del Rey,
   California.  Postel was also the original IANA as well as Director of
   the Computer Networks Division at ISI.

RFC 5540                    40th Anniversary                7 April 2009


   Upon the occasion of the 30th anniversary of RFC 1 and as a tribute
   to the massive contribution of Jon Postel, the RFC Editor published
   RFC 2555 [RFC2555] on April 7, 1999.  This RFC contained
   recollections from three networking pioneers: Steve Crocker who wrote
   RFC 1, Vint Cerf whose long-range vision continues to guide us, and
   Jake Feinler who played a key role in the middle years of the RFC
   series.

   Ten more years have now passed, and we have reached the 40th
   anniversary of the RFC series.  The series has more than doubled in
   size during the last ten years, and it is expected to continue far
   into the future.  All the good things said in RFC 2555 still hold
   true ten years later.

   We should, however, note some changes that have occurred over the
   past ten years.

   o  After Jon passed away, Joyce Reynolds and Bob Braden put together
      a small organization at USC/ISI to continue the RFC Editor
      function.  This was motivated by a desire to honor Postel by
      continuing his remarkable effort and to provide a service to the
      Internet community.

   o  Funding of the RFC Editor, which had been supported by the US
      government until 1998, was taken over by the Internet Society.
      During 1998-2006, ISOC funded the RFC Editor under a series of
      annual contracts and extensions.  ISOC put the function out for
      competitive bid for 2007 (USC/ISI was selected to provide RFC
      Editor services from 2007-2009), and the contract will be put out
      to bid again for post-2009.

      During 2009 there will be a significant transition for the RFC
      Editor function, as some new organization or set of organizations
      takes over this service that has been performed at USC/ISI
      continuously since 1978.

   o  Many improvements have increased the efficiency and transparency
      of the RFC editorial process [RFCed09].

   o  The RFC Editor formed an RFC Editorial Board, a group of people
      with broad and deep knowledge of the Internet and networking.  One
      of its major functions is to assist the RFC Editor by reviewing
      RFCs in the Independent Submission stream.

   o  An email list, rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org, was created to obtain
      community input on the RFC Editor functions.
