  Deprecate DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP, and Other Weak Cryptographic Algorithms
                              in Kerberos

Abstract

   The Kerberos 5 network authentication protocol, originally specified
   in RFC 1510, can use the Data Encryption Standard (DES) for
   encryption.  Almost 30 years after first publishing DES, the National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) finally withdrew the
   standard in 2005, reflecting a long-established consensus that DES is
   insufficiently secure.  By 2008, commercial hardware costing less
   than USD 15,000 could break DES keys in less than a day on average.
   DES is long past its sell-by date.  Accordingly, this document
   updates RFC 1964, RFC 4120, RFC 4121, and RFC 4757 to deprecate the
   use of DES, RC4-HMAC-EXP, and other weak cryptographic algorithms in
   Kerberos.  Because RFC 1510 (obsoleted by RFC 4120) supports only
   DES, this document recommends the reclassification of RFC 1510 as
   Historic.

RFC 6649                Deprecate DES in Kerberos              July 2012


1.  Introduction

   The original specification of the Kerberos 5 network authentication
   protocol [RFC1510] supports only the Data Encryption Standard (DES)
   for encryption.  For many years, the cryptographic community has
   regarded DES as providing inadequate security, mostly because of its
   small key size.  Accordingly, this document recommends the
   reclassification of [RFC1510] (obsoleted by [RFC4120]) as Historic
   and updates current Kerberos-related specifications [RFC1964],
   [RFC4120], and [RFC4121] to deprecate the use of DES and other weak
   cryptographic algorithms in Kerberos, including some unkeyed
   checksums and hashes, along with the weak 56-bit "export strength"
   RC4 variant encryption type of [RFC4757].

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Affected Specifications

   The original IETF specification of Kerberos 5 [RFC1510] only supports
   DES for encryption.  [RFC4120] obsoletes [RFC1510] and updates the
   Kerberos specification to include additional cryptographic
   algorithms, but still permits the use of DES.  [RFC3961] describes
   the Kerberos cryptographic system and includes support for DES
   encryption types, but it does not specify requirement levels for
   them.

   The specification of the Kerberos Generic Security Services
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API) mechanism [RFC1964] and
   its updated version [RFC4121] define checksum and encryption
   mechanisms based on DES.  With the existence of newer encryption
   types for Kerberos GSS-API defined in [RFC4121], Microsoft's
   RC4-HMAC-based GSS-API mechanism, and MIT's DES3 (which is not
   published as an RFC), there is no need to support the old DES-based
   integrity (SGN) and confidentiality (SEAL) types.

   [RFC4757] describes the RC4-HMAC encryption types used by Microsoft
   Windows and allows for a 56-bit "export strength" variant.  (The
   character constant "fortybits" used in the definition is a historical
   reference and does not refer to the actual key size of the encryption
   type.)

4.  DES Insecurity

   The insecurity of DES has been evident for many years.  Even around
   the time of its first publication, cryptographers raised the
   possibility that 56 bits was too small a key size for DES.  The
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially
   withdrew DES in 2005 [DES-Withdrawal], and also announced a
   transition period that ended on May 19, 2007 [DES-Transition-Plan].
   The IETF has also published its position in [RFC4772], in which the
   recommendation summary is very clear: "don't use DES".

   In 2006, researchers demonstrated the ability to find a DES key via
   brute-force search in an average of less than 9 days using less than
   EUR 10,000 worth of hardware [Break-DES].  By 2008, a company was
   offering hardware capable of breaking a DES key in less than a day on
   average [DES-1day] that cost less than USD 15,000 [DES-Crack].
   Brute-force key searches of DES will only get faster and cheaper.
   (The aforementioned company markets its device for one-click recovery
   of lost DES keys.)  It is clear that it is well past time to retire
   the use of DES in Kerberos.

5.  Recommendations

   This document hereby removes the following RECOMMENDED types from
   [RFC4120]:

      Encryption: DES-CBC-MD5(3)

      Checksums: DES-MD5 (8, named RSA-MD5-DES in [RFC3961]).

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or
   deploy the following single DES encryption types: DES-CBC-CRC(1),
   DES-CBC-MD4(2), DES-CBC-MD5(3) (updates [RFC4120]).

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or
   deploy the following "export strength" RC4 variant encryption type:
   RC4-HMAC-EXP(24) (updates [RFC4757]).  This document does not add any
   sort of requirement for conforming implementations to implement
   RC4-HMAC(23).

   Kerberos implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT implement or
   deploy the following checksum types: CRC32(1), RSA-MD4(2),
   RSA-MD4-DES(3), DES-MAC(4), DES-MAC-K(5), RSA-MD4-DES-K(6),
   RSA-MD5-DES(8) (updates [RFC4120]).

   It is possible to safely use the RSA-MD5(7) checksum type, but only
   with additional protection, such as the protection that an encrypted
   Authenticator provides.  Implementations MAY use RSA-MD5 inside an

RFC 6649                Deprecate DES in Kerberos              July 2012


   encrypted Authenticator for backward compatibility with systems that
   do not support newer checksum types (updates [RFC4120]).  One example
   is that some legacy systems only support RC4-HMAC(23) [RFC4757] for
   encryption when DES is not available; these systems use RSA-MD5
   checksums inside Authenticators encrypted with RC4-HMAC.

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement or deploy the following SGN ALG: DES MAC MD5(0000),
   MD2.5(0100), DES MAC(0200) (updates [RFC1964]).

   Kerberos GSS mechanism implementations and deployments SHOULD NOT
   implement or deploy the following SEAL ALG: DES(0000) (updates
   [RFC1964]).

   The effect of the two last sentences is that this document deprecates
   Section 1.2 of [RFC1964].

   This document hereby recommends the reclassification of [RFC1510] as
   Historic.

6.  Security Considerations

   Removing support for single DES improves security because DES is
   considered to be insecure.  RC4-HMAC-EXP has a similarly inadequate
   key size, so removing support for it also improves security.

   Kerberos defines some encryption types that are either underspecified
   or that only have number assignments but no specifications.
   Implementations should make sure that they only implement and enable
   secure encryption types.

   The security considerations of [RFC4757] continue to apply to
   RC4-HMAC, including the known weaknesses of RC4 and MD4, and this
   document does not change the Informational status of [RFC4757] for
   now.  The main reason to not actively discourage the use of RC4-HMAC
   is that it is the only encryption type that interoperates with older
   versions of Microsoft Windows once DES and RC4-HMAC-EXP are removed.
   These older versions of Microsoft Windows will likely be in use until
   at least 2015.
