   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP-
   based management of MCNS/DOCSIS compliant Radio Frequency (RF)
   interfaces.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7].  The set of objects are consistent with the
   SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.

   This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet
   Engineering Task Force.  Comments are solicited and should be
   addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@terayon.com
   and/or the author.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
       purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
       Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
       16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
       second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
       [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
       first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
       described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
       protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
       called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10].
       The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
       described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

   o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
       first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
       described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
       operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
       [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
       the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
       [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB MUST be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over
   Cable Service Interface Specification process.

2.1.  CATV

   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals
   to a community.

2.2.  Channel

   A specific frequency allocation with an RF medium, specified by
   channel width in Hertz (cycles per second) and by center frequency.
   Within the US Cable Systems, upstream channels are generally
   allocated from the 5-42MHz range while down stream channels are
   generally allocated from the 50-750MHz range depending on the
   capabilities of the given system.  The typical broadcast channel
   width in the US is 6MHz.  Upstream channel widths for DOCSIS vary.

   A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data
   system.

2.4.  CMTS   Cable Modem Termination System.

   A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head-end.
   A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS compliant cable data
   system.  It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it
   controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated
   CMs.

2.5.  Codeword

   See [16]. A characteristic of the Foward Error Correction scheme used
   above the RF media layer.

2.6.  Data Packet

3.  Overview

   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of
   MCNS/DOCSIS compliant Cable Modem (CM) and Cable Modem Termination
   System (CMTS) RF interfaces.  The specification is derived in part
   from the parameters and protocols described in DOCSIS Radio Frequency
   Interface Specification [16].

3.1.  Structure of the MIB

   This MIB is structured as three groups:

   o    Management information pertinent to both Cable Modems (CM) and
        Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS) (docsIfBaseObjects).

   o    Management information pertinent to Cable Modems only
        (docsIfCmObjects).

   o    Management information pertinent to Cable Modem Termination
        Systems only (docsIfCmtsObjects).

   Tables within each of these groups group objects functionally - e.g.
   Quality of Service, Channel characteristics, MAC layer management,
   etc.  Rows created automatically (e.g. by the device according to the
   hardware configuration) may and generally will have a mixture of
   configuration and status objects within them.  Rows that are meant to
   be created by the management station are generally restricted to
   configuration (read-create) objects.

3.1.1.  docsIfBaseObjects

   docsIfDownstreamChannelTable - This table describes the active
   downstream channels for a CMTS and the received downstream channel
   for a CM.

   docsIfUpstreamChannelTable - This table describes the active upstream
   channels for a a CMTS and the current upstream transmission channel
   for a CM.

   docsIfQosProfileTable - This table describes the valid Quality of
   Service service profiles for the cable data system.

   docsIfSignalQualityTable - This table is used to monitor RF signal
   quality characteristics of received signals.

RFC 2670                DOCSIS RF Interface MIB              August 1999


3.1.2.  docsIfCmObjects

   docsIfCmMacTable - This table is used to monitor the DOCSIS MAC
   interface and can be considered an extension to the ifEntry.

   docsIfCmServiceTable - This table describes the upstream service
   queues available at this CM.  There is a comparable table at the
   CMTS, docsIfCmtsServiceEntry, which describes the service queues from
   the point of view of the CMTS.

3.1.3.  docsIfCmtsObjects

   docsIfCmtsStatusTable - This table provides a set of aggregated
   counters which roll-up values and events that occur on the underlying
   sub-interfaces.

   docsIfCmtsCmStatusTable - This table is used to hold information
   about known (e.g. registered) cable modems on the system serviced by
   this CMTS.

   docsIfCmtsServiceEntry - This table provides access to the
   information related to upstream service queues.

   docsIfCmtsModulationTable - This table allows control over the
   modulation profiles for RF channels associated with this CMTS.

   docsIfCmtsMacToCmTable - This table allows fast access into the
   docsIfCmtsCmTable via a MAC address (of the CM) interface.

3.2.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces
   MIB [17].  Several areas of correlation are addressed in the
   following subsections.  The implementor is referred to the Interfaces
   MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these
   areas.

3.2.1.  Layering Model

   An instance of ifEntry exists for each RF Downstream interface, for
   each RF Upstream interface, and for each RF MAC layer.  The
   ifStackTable [17] MUST be implemented to identify relationships among
   sub-interfaces.








St. Johns                       Standard                        [Page 7]

RFC 2670                DOCSIS RF Interface MIB              August 1999


   The following example illustrates a MAC interface with one downstream
   and two upstream channels.

                               | <== to network layer
                 +-------------+--------------+
                 |           RF MAC           |
                 +----+---------+-----------+-+
                      |         |           |
            +---------+---+ +---+-------+ +-+---------+
            | Downstream1 | | Upstream1 | | Upstream2 |
            +-------------+ +-----------+ +-----------+

   As can be seen from this example, the RF MAC interface is layered on
   top of the downstream and upstream interfaces.

   In this example, the assignment of index values could be as follows:

      ifIndex ifType                   Description

      1    docsCableMaclayer(127)   CATV MAC Layer
      2    docsCableDownstream(128) CATV Downstream interface
      3    docsCableUpstream(129)   CATV Upstream interface
      4    docsCableUpstream(129)   CATV Upstream interface

      The corresponding ifStack entries would then be:

           | IfStackHigherLayer | ifStackLowerLayer |
           |         0          |         1         |
           |         1          |         2         |
           |         1          |         3         |
           |         1          |         4         |
           |         2          |         0         |
           |         3          |         0         |
           |         4          |         0         |

   The same interface model can also be used in Telephony or Telco
   Return systems.  A pure Telco Return system (Cable Modem as well as
   Cable Modem Termination System) would not have upstream, but only
   downstream cable channels.  Systems supporting both Telco Return and
   cable upstream channels can use the above model without modification.

   Telco Return Upstream channel(s) are handled by the appropriate MIBs,
   such as PPP or Modem MIBs.

3.2.2.  Virtual Circuits

   This medium does not support virtual circuits and this area is not
   applicable to this MIB.

   ifGeneralInformationGroup and the ifPacketGroup of the Interfaces
   MIB.  This is an output only interface at the CMTS and all input
   status counters - ifIn* - will return zero.  This is an input only
   interface at the CM and all output status counters - ifOut* - will
   return zero.

5.  Acknowledgments

   This document was produced by the IPCDN Working Group.  It is based
   on a document written by Pam Anderson from CableLabs, Wilson Sawyer
   from BayNetworks, and Rich Woundy from Continental Cablevision.  The
   original working group editor, Guenter Roeck of cisco Systems, did
   much of the grunt work of putting the document into its current form.

   Special thanks is also due to Azlina Palmer, who helped a lot
   reviewing the document.

7.  Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system which will provide metropolitan public
   internet access.  As such, improper manipulation of the objects
   represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a large
   number of end-users.  In addition, manipulation of the
   docsIfCmServiceQosProfile, docsIfCmtsServerQosProfile, and the
   elements of docsIfQosProfileTable may allow an end-user to improve
   their service response or decrease other subscriber service response.

   This MIB does not affect confidentiality, authentication or
   authorization of services on a cable modem system.  For
   authentication and authorization, please see the related document
   "Cable Device Management Information Base for DOCSIS compliant Cable
   Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems" [18].  For
   confidentiality, the working group expects to issue a MIB which
   describes the management of the DOCSIS Baseline Privacy mechanism.

8.  Intellectual Property

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
