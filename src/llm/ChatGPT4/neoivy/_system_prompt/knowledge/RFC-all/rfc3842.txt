RFC 3842                  SIP Message Waiting                August 2004


2.  Background and Appropriateness

   Message Waiting Indication is a common feature of telephone networks.
   It typically involves an audible or visible indication that messages
   are waiting, such as playing a special dial tone (which in telephone
   networks is called message-waiting dial tone), lighting a light or
   indicator on the phone, displaying icons or text, or some
   combination.

      Message-waiting dial tone is similar to but distinct from stutter
      dial tone.  Both are defined in GR-506 [11].

   The methods in the SIP [1] base specification were only designed to
   solve the problem of session initiation for multimedia sessions, and
   rendezvous.  Since Message Waiting Indication is really status
   information orthogonal to a session, it was not clear how an IP
   telephone acting as a SIP User Agent would implement comparable
   functionality.  Members of the telephony community viewed this as a
   shortcoming of SIP.

   Users want the useful parts of the functionality they have using
   traditional analog, mobile, and PBX telephones.  It is also desirable
   to provide comparable functionality in a flexible way that allows for
   more customization and new features.  SIP Specific Event Notification
   (RFC 3265 -- SIP Events) [2] is an appropriate mechanism to use in
   this environment, as it preserves the user mobility and rendezvous
   features which SIP provides.

   Using SIP-Specific Event Notification, a Subscriber User Agent
   (typically an IP phone or SIP software User Agent) subscribes to the
   status of their messages.  A SIP User Agent acting on behalf of the
   user's messaging system then notifies the Subscriber each time the
   messaging account's messages have changed.  (This Notifier could be
   composed with a User Agent that provides a real-time media interface
   to send or receive messages, or it could be a stand-alone entity.)
   The Notifier sends a message summary in the body of a NOTIFY, encoded
   in a new MIME type defined later in this document.  A User Agent can
   also explicitly fetch the current status.

   A SIP User Agent MAY subscribe to multiple accounts (distinguished by
   the Request URI).  Multiple SIP User Agents MAY subscribe to the same
   account.

   Before any subscriptions or notifications are sent, each interested
   User Agent must be made aware of its messaging notifier(s).  This MAY
   be manually configured on interested User Agents, manually configured
   on an appropriate SIP Proxy, or dynamically discovered based on

   requested caller preferences [4] and registered callee capabilities
   [5].  (For more information on usage with callee capabilities, see
   Section 4.2)

3.  Event Package Formal Definition

3.1.  Event Package Name

   This document defines a SIP Event Package as defined in RFC 3265 [2].
   The event-package token name for this package is:

      "message-summary"

3.2.  Event Package Parameters

   This package does not define any event package parameters.

3.3.  SUBSCRIBE Bodies

   This package does not define any SUBSCRIBE bodies.

3.4.  Subscription Duration

   Subscriptions to this event package MAY range from minutes to weeks.
   Subscriptions in hours or days are more typical and are RECOMMENDED.
   The default subscription duration for this event package is one hour.

3.5.  NOTIFY Bodies

   A simple text-based format is proposed to prevent an undue burden on
   low-end user agents, for example, inexpensive IP phones with no
   display.  Although this format is text-based, it is intended for
   machine consumption only.

   A future extension MAY define other NOTIFY bodies.  If no "Accept"
   header is present in the SUBSCRIBE, the body type defined in this
   document MUST be assumed.

   The format specified in this proposal attempts to separate orthogonal
   attributes of messages as much as possible.  Messages are separated
   by message-context-class (for example: voice-message, fax-message,
   pager-message, multimedia-message, text-message, and none), by
   message status (new and old), and urgent and non-urgent type.

   The text format begins with a simple status line, and optionally a
   summary line per message-context-class.  Message-context-classes are
   defined in [7].  For each message-context-class, the total number of
   new and old messages is reported in the new and old fields.



Mahy                        Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 3842                  SIP Message Waiting                August 2004


   In some cases, detailed message summaries are not available.  The
   status line allows messaging systems or messaging gateways to provide
   the traditional boolean message waiting notification.

      Messages-Waiting: yes

   If the Request-URI or To header in a message-summary subscription
   corresponds to a group or collection of individual messaging
   accounts, the notifier MUST specify to which account the message-
   summary body corresponds.  Note that the account URI MUST NOT be
   delimited with angle brackets ("<" and ">").

      Message-Account: sip:alice@example.com

   In the example that follows, more than boolean message summary
   information is available to the User Agent.  There are two new and
   four old fax messages.

      Fax-Message: 2/4

   After the summary, the format can optionally list a summary count of
   urgent messages.  In the next example there are one new and three old
   voice messages, none of the new messages are urgent, but one of the
   old messages is.  All counters have a maximum value of 4,294,967,295
   ((2^32) - 1).  Notifiers MUST NOT generate a request with a larger
   value.  Subscribers MUST treat a larger value as 2^32-1.

      Voice-Message: 1/3 (0/1)

   Optionally, after the summary counts, the messaging systems MAY
   append RFC 2822 style message headers [9], which further describe
   newly added messages.  Message headers MUST NOT be included in an
   initial NOTIFY, as new messages could be essentially unbounded in
   size.  Message headers included in subsequent notifications MUST only
   correspond to messages added since the previous notification for that
   subscription.  A messaging system which includes message headers in a
   NOTIFY MUST provide an administrator configurable mechanism to select
   which headers are sent.  Headers likely for inclusion are To, From,
   Date, Subject, and Message-ID.  Note that the formatting of these
   headers in this body is identical to that of SIP extension-headers,
   not the (similar) format defined in RFC 2822.

   Implementations which generate large notifications are reminded to
   follow the message size restrictions for unreliable transports
   articulated in Section 18.1.1 of SIP [1].

   Mapping local message state to new/old message status and urgency is
   an implementation issue of the messaging system.  However, the



Mahy                        Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 3842                  SIP Message Waiting                August 2004


   messaging notifier MUST NOT consider a message "old" merely because
   it generated a notification, as this could prevent another
   subscription from accurately receiving message-summary notifications.
   Likewise, the messaging system MAY use any suitable algorithm to
   determine that a message is "urgent".

   Messaging systems MAY use any algorithm for determining the
   appropriate message-context-class for a specific message.  Systems
   which use Internet Mail SHOULD use the contents of the Message-
   Context header [7] (defined in RFC 3458) if present as a hint to make
   a context determination.  Note that a composed messaging system does
   not need to support a given context in order to generate
   notifications identified with that context.

3.6.  Subscriber Generation of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   Subscriber User Agents will typically SUBSCRIBE to message summary
   information for a period of hours or days, and automatically attempt
   to re-SUBSCRIBE well before the subscription is completely expired.
   If re-subscription fails, the Subscriber SHOULD periodically retry
   again until a subscription is successful, taking care to backoff to
   avoid network congestion.  If a subscription has expired, new re-
   subscriptions MUST use a new Call-ID.

   The Subscriber SHOULD SUBSCRIBE to that user's message summaries
   whenever a new user becomes associated with the device (a new login).
   The Subscriber MAY also explicitly fetch the current status at any
   time.  The subscriber SHOULD renew its subscription immediately after
   a reboot, or when the subscriber's network connectivity has just been
   re-established.

   The Subscriber MUST be prepared to receive and process a NOTIFY with
   new state immediately after sending a new SUBSCRIBE, a SUBSCRIBE
   renewal, an unsubscribe, a fetch, or at any other time during the
   subscription.

   When a user de-registers from a device (logoff, power down of a
   mobile device, etc.), subscribers SHOULD unsubscribe by sending a
   SUBSCRIBE message with an Expires header of zero.

3.7.  Notifier Processing of SUBSCRIBE Requests

   When a SIP Messaging System receives SUBSCRIBE messages with the
   message-summary event-type, it SHOULD authenticate the subscription
   request.  If authentication is successful, the Notifier MAY limit the
   duration of the subscription to an administrator defined amount of
   time as described in SIP Events [2].

RFC 3842                  SIP Message Waiting                August 2004


3.8.  Notifier Generation of NOTIFY Requests

   Immediately after a subscription is accepted, the Notifier MUST send
   a NOTIFY with the current message summary information.  This allows
   the Subscriber to resynchronize its state.  This initial
   synchronization NOTIFY MUST NOT include the optional RFC 2822 style
   message headers [8].

   When the status of the messages changes sufficiently for a messaging
   account to change the number of new or old messages, the Notifier
   SHOULD send a NOTIFY message to all active subscribers of that
   account.  NOTIFY messages sent to subscribers of a group or alias,
   MUST contain the message account name in the notification body.

   A Messaging System MAY send a NOTIFY with an "Expires" header of "0"
   and a "Subscription-State" header of "terminated" before a graceful
   shutdown.

3.9.  Subscriber Processing of NOTIFY Requests

   Upon receipt of a valid NOTIFY request, the subscriber SHOULD
   immediately render the message status and summary information to the
   end user in an implementation specific way.

   The Subscriber MUST be prepared to receive NOTIFYs from different
   Contacts corresponding to the same SUBSCRIBE.  (The SUBSCRIBE may
   have been forked).

3.10.  Handling of Forked Requests

   Forked requests are allowed for this event type and may install
   multiple subscriptions.  The Subscriber MAY render multiple summaries
   corresponding to the same account directly to the user, or MAY merge
   them as described below.

   If any of the "Messages-Waiting" status lines report "yes", then the
   merged state is "yes"; otherwise the merged state is "no".

   The Subscriber MAY merge summary lines in an implementation-specific
   way if all notifications contain at least one msg-summary line.

3.11.  Rate of Notifications

   A Notifier MAY choose to hold NOTIFY requests in "quarantine" for a
   short administrator-defined period (seconds or minutes) when the
   message status is changing rapidly.  Requests in the quarantine which
   become invalid are replaced by newer notifications, thus reducing the
   total volume of notifications.  This behavior is encouraged for



Mahy                        Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 3842                  SIP Message Waiting                August 2004


   implementations with heavy interactive use.  Note that timely
   notification resulting in a change of overall state (messages waiting
   or not) and notification of newly added messages is probably more
   significant to the end user than a notification of newly deleted
   messages which do not affect the overall message waiting state (e.g.,
   there are still new messages).

   Notifiers SHOULD NOT generate NOTIFY requests more frequently than
   once per second.

3.12.  State Agents and Lists

   A Subscriber MAY use an "alias" or "group" in the Request-URI of a
   subscription if that name is significant to the messaging system.
   Implementers MAY create a service which consolidates and summarizes
   NOTIFYs from many Contacts.  This document does not preclude
   implementations from building state agents which support this event
   package.  One way to implement such a service is with the event list
   extension [10].

3.13.  Behavior of a Proxy Server

   There are no additional requirements on a SIP Proxy, other than to
   transparently forward the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods as required in
   SIP.  However, Proxies SHOULD allow non-SIP URLs.  Proxies and
   Redirect servers SHOULD be able to direct the SUBSCRIBE request to an
   appropriate messaging notifier User Agent.

4.  Examples of Usage

4.1.  Example Message Flow

   The examples shown below are for informational purposes only.  For a
   normative description of the event package, please see sections 3 and
   5 of this document.

   In the example call flow below, Alice's IP phone subscribes to the
   status of Alice's messages.  Via headers are omitted for clarity.

4.2.  Example Usage with Callee Capabilities and Caller Preferences

   The use of callee capabilities is optional but encouraged.  If callee
   capabilities are used, a messaging notifier MAY REGISTER a Contact
   with an appropriate methods and events tag as shown in the example
   below.  To further distinguish itself, the messaging notifier MAY
   also REGISTER as a Contact with the actor="msg-taker" tag.  An
   example of this kind of registration follows below.

       REGISTER sip:sip3-sj.example.com SIP/2.0
       To: <sip:alice@example.com>
       From: <sip:alice@example.com>;tag=4442
       ...
       Contact: <sip:alice@vm13-sj.example.com>
        ;actor="msg-taker";methods="SUBSCRIBE"
        ;automata;events="message-summary"

   The following SUBSCRIBE message would find the Contact which
   registered in the example above.

       SUBSCRIBE sip:alice@example.com SIP/2.0
       ...
       Accept: application/simple-message-summary
       Event: message-summary
       Accept-Contact: *;automata;actor="msg-taker"

5.  Formal Syntax

   The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
   Form (BNF) as described in RFC 2234 [6].

5.1.  New Event-Package Definition

   This document defines a new event-package with the package name:

      message-summary

5.2.  Body Format Syntax

   The formal syntax for the application/simple-message-summary MIME
   type is described below.  The message-context-class production is
   defined in Section 6.2 of RFC 3458 [7].  Note that all productions
   described here are case insensitive.

   message-summary = msg-status-line CRLF
                      [msg-account CRLF]
                      [*(msg-summary-line CRLF)]
                      [ *opt-msg-headers ]

   msg-status-line  = "Messages-Waiting" HCOLON msg-status
   msg-status = "yes" / "no"
   msg-account = "Message-Account" HCOLON Account-URI
   Account-URI = SIP-URI / SIPS-URI / absoluteURI

   msg-summary-line = message-context-class HCOLON newmsgs SLASH oldmsgs
                   [ LPAREN new-urgentmsgs SLASH old-urgentmsgs RPAREN ]

   opt-msg-headers = CRLF 1*(extension-header CRLF)

   newmsgs = msgcount
   oldmsgs = msgcount
   new-urgentmsgs = msgcount
   old-urgentmsgs  = msgcount
   msgcount = 1*DIGIT   ; MUST NOT exceed 2^32-1

6.  Security Considerations

   Message summaries and optional message bodies contain information
   which is typically very privacy sensitive.  At a minimum,
   subscriptions to this event package SHOULD be authenticated and
   properly authorized.  Furthermore, notifications SHOULD be encrypted
   and integrity protected using either end-to-end mechanisms, or the
   hop-by-hop protection afforded messages sent to SIPS URIs.

   Additional and privacy security considerations are discussed in
   detail in SIP [1] and SIP Events [2].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  SIP Event Package Registration for message-summary

   Package name: message-summary

   Type: package

   Contact: [Mahy]

   Published Specification: This document.

7.2.  MIME Registration for application/simple-message-summary

   MIME media type name: application

   MIME subtype name: simple-message-summary

   Required parameters: none.

   Optional parameters: none.

   Encoding considerations:   This MIME type was designed for
     use with protocols which can carry binary-encoded data.
     Although the format of this MIME type is similar to RFC 2822,
     it is not identical.  (Specifically, line folding rules are
     SIP-specific and included URIs can contain non-ASCII
     characters.)  Protocols which do not carry binary data
     (which have line length or character-set restrictions
     for example) MUST use a reversible transfer encoding
     (such as base64) to carry this MIME type.

   Security considerations: See the "Security Considerations"
     section in this document.

   Interoperability considerations: none

   Published specification: This document.

   Applications which use this media: The simple-message-summary
   application subtype supports the exchange of message waiting and
   message summary information in SIP networks.
