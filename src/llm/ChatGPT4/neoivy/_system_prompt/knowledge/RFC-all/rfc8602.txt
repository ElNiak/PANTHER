1.  Introduction

   This memo updates the IANA registry rules for the Telephony Routing
   over IP (TRIP) protocol, by no longer requiring that postal addresses
   be included in contact information.  No use for the addresses is
   identified, and omitting this information provides a privacy benefit.

   This memo updates RFC 3219.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This memo updates the registration rules [RFC8126] for TRIP
   Attributes ([RFC3219], Section 13.2) and TRIP IP Telephony
   Administrative Domain (ITAD) Numbers ([RFC3219], Section 13.5) as
   follows.

   The IETF no longer requires IANA to collect postal address
   information when adding TRIP registry entries.  Additionally, IANA
   has removed previously collected postal addresses from the
   registries.

3.  Security Considerations

   No security impacts of this change have been identified.
