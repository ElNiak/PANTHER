                 the Bridge Network Control Protocol of
                      the Point-to-Point Protocol

Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing the
   bridge Network Control Protocol [10] on subnetwork interfaces using
   the family of Point-to-Point Protocols.

1.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 defines a more concise description mechanism, which is

RFC 1474                     PPP/Bridge MIB                    June 1993


      wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17/RFC 1213 which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [3]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

2.1.  Format of Definitions

   Section 4 contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [5,6].

3.  Overview

3.1.  Object Selection Criteria

   To be consistent with IAB directives and good engineering practice,
   an explicit attempt was made to keep this MIB as simple as possible.
   This was accomplished by applying the following criteria to objects
   proposed for inclusion:

      (1)  Require objects be essential for either fault or
           configuration management.  In particular, objects for
           which the sole purpose was to debug implementations were
           explicitly excluded from the MIB.

      (2)  Consider evidence of current use and/or utility.

      (3)  Limit the total number of objects.

      (4)  Exclude objects which are simply derivable from others in

           this or other MIBs.

3.2.  Structure of the PPP

   This section describes the basic model of PPP used in developing the
   PPP MIB. This information should be useful to the implementor in
   understanding some of the basic design decisions of the MIB.

   The PPP is not one single protocol but a large family of protocols.
   Each of these is, in itself, a fairly complex protocol.  The PPP
   protocols may be divided into three rough categories:

   Control Protocols
      The Control Protocols are used to control the operation of the
      PPP. The Control Protocols include the Link Control Protocol
      (LCP), the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), the Link
      Quality Report (LQR), and the Challenge Handshake Authentication
      Protocol (CHAP).

   Network Protocols
      The Network Protocols are used to move the network traffic over
      the PPP interface.  A Network Protocol encapsulates the datagrams
      of a specific higher-layer protocol that is using the PPP as a
      data link.  Note that within the context of PPP, the term "Network
      Protocol" does not imply an OSI Layer-3 protocol; for instance,
      there is a Bridging network protocol.

   Network Control Protocols (NCPs)
      The NCPs are used to control the operation of the Network
      Protocols. Generally, each Network Protocol has its own Network
      Control Protocol; thus, the IP Network Protocol has its IP Control
      Protocol, the Bridging Network Protocol has its Bridging Network
      Control Protocol and so on.

   This document specifies the objects used in managing one of these
   protocols, namely the Bridge Network Control Protocol.

3.3.  MIB Groups

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into several MIB groups.  Each group
   is organized as a set of related objects.

   These groups are the basic unit of conformance: if the semantics of a
   group are applicable to an implementation then all objects in the
   group must be implemented.

   The PPP MIB is organized into several MIB Groups, including, but not
   limited to, the following groups:

          o The PPP LQR Group
          o The PPP LQR Extensions Group
          o The PPP IP Group
          o The PPP Bridge Group
          o The PPP Security Group

   This document specifies the following group:

   The PPP Bridge Group
      The PPP Bridge Group contains configuration, status, and control
      variables that apply to the operation of Bridging over PPP.

      Implementation of this group is mandatory for all implementations
      of PPP that support the Bridging over PPP.

6.  Security Considerations

   The PPP MIB affords the network operator the ability to configure and
   control the PPP links of a particular system, including the PPP
   authentication protocols. This represents a security risk.

   These risks are addressed in the following manners:

      (1)  All variables which represent a significant security risk
           are placed in separate, optional, MIB Groups. As the MIB
           Group is the quantum of implementation within a MIB, the
           implementor of the MIB may elect not to implement these
           groups.

      (2)  The implementor may choose to implement the variables
           which present a security risk so that they may not be
           written, i.e., the variables are READ-ONLY. This method
           still presents a security risk, and is not recommended,
           in that the variables, specifically the PPP
           Authentication Protocols' variables, may be easily read.

      (3)  Using SNMPv2, the operator can place the variables into
           MIB views which are protected in that the parties which
           have access to those MIB views use authentication and
           privacy protocols, or the operator may elect to make
           these views not accessible to any party.  In order to
           facilitate this placement, all security-related variables
           are placed in separate MIB Tables. This eases the
           identification of the necessary MIB View Subtree.
