                IANA Registries for LSP Ping Code Points

Abstract

   RFCs 4379 and 6424 created name spaces for Multi-Protocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Path (LSP) Ping.  However, those RFCs
   did not create the corresponding IANA registries for Downstream
   Mapping object Flags (DS Flags), Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and
   Interface and Label Stack Address Types.

   There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
   name spaces.  This document updates RFCs 4379 and 6424 in that it
   creates IANA registries for that purpose.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] created name spaces for MPLS LSP Ping.
   However, those RFCs did not create the corresponding IANA registries
   for DS Flags, Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label
   Stack Address Types.

   There is now a need to make further code point allocations from these
   name spaces.  In particular, [ENTROPY-LSP-PING] and [LSP-PING-LAG]
   request new DS Flags and Multipath Type allocations.

   This document updates [RFC4379] and [RFC6424] in that it creates IANA
   registries for that purpose.

   Note that "DS Flags" and "Multipath Type" are fields included in two
   TLVs defined in the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry: Downstream
   Mapping (DEPRECATED) (value 2) and Downstream Detailed Mapping (value
   20).  Modification to either registry will affect both TLVs.

2.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has created new registries within the "Multi-
   Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping
   Parameters" [IANA-MPLS-LSP-PING] registry to maintain DS Flags,
   Multipath Types, Pad TLVs, and Interface and Label Stack Address
   Types fields.  The registry names and initial values are described in
   the immediate subsections that follow.

2.1.  DS Flags

   [RFC4379] defines the Downstream Mapping (DSMAP) TLV, which has Type
   2 assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

   [RFC6424] defines the Downstream Detailed Mapping (DDMAP) TLV, which
   has Type 20 assigned from the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters - TLVs" registry.

   DSMAP has been deprecated by DDMAP, but both TLVs share a field: DS
   Flags.

   IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "DS Flags".

   The registration policy for this registry is Standards Action
   [RFC5226].

   IANA has made the following initial assignments:

   Registry Name: DS Flags

    Bit number Name                                         Reference
    ---------- ----------------------------------------     ---------
          7    N: Treat as a Non-IP Packet                   RFC 4379
          6    I: Interface and Label Stack Object Request   RFC 4379
        5-0    Unassigned

2.2.  Multipath Types

   IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Multipath
   Types".

   The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are as follows:

      0-250    Standards Action
    251-254    Experimental Use
        255    Standards Action

2.3.  Pad Type

   IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Pad Types".

   The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are:

2.4.  Interface and Label Stack Address Type

   IANA has created and now maintains a registry entitled "Interface and
   Label Stack Address Types".

   The registration policies [RFC5226] for this registry are:

      0-250    Standards Action
    251-254    Experimental Use
        255    Standards Action

   IANA has made the following initial assignments:

3.  Security Considerations

   This document simply creates IANA registries for code points defined
   in [RFC4379] and [RFC6424].  Thus, there are no new security
   concerns.
