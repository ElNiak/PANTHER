1.  Introduction

   The softwire mesh framework [RFC5565] is a tunneling mechanism that
   enables connectivity between islands of IPv4 networks across a single
   IPv6 backbone and vice versa.  In a softwire mesh, extended
   Multiprotocol BGP (MP-BGP) is used to set up tunnels and advertise
   prefixes among Address Family Border Routers (AFBRs).

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing a softwire mesh
   [RFC5565].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the softwire problem statement
   [RFC4925], the BGP encapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier
   (SAFI), the BGP tunnel encapsulation attribute [RFC5512], the
   softwire mesh framework [RFC5565], and the BGP IPsec tunnel
   encapsulation attribute [RFC5566].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The Softwire Mesh MIB provides a method to monitor the softwire mesh
   objects through SNMP.

4.1.  The swmSupportedTunnelTable Subtree

   The swmSupportedTunnelTable subtree provides the information about
   what types of tunnels can be used for softwire mesh scenarios in the
   AFBR.  The softwire mesh framework [RFC5565] does not mandate the use
   of any particular tunneling technology.  Based on the BGP tunnel
   encapsulation attribute tunnel types introduced by RFC 5512 [RFC5512]
   and RFC 5566 [RFC5566], the softwire mesh tunnel types include at
   least L2TPv3 (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3) over IP, GRE
   (Generic Routing Encapsulation), Transmit tunnel endpoint, IPsec in
   Tunnel-mode, IP in IP tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode, MPLS-in-IP
   tunnel with IPsec Transport Mode, and IP in IP.  The detailed
   encapsulation information of different tunnel types (e.g., L2TPv3
   Session ID, GRE Key, etc.) is not managed in the Softwire Mesh MIB.

4.2.  The swmEncapsTable Subtree

   The swmEncapsTable subtree provides softwire mesh NLRI-NH information
   (Network Layer Reachability Information - Next Hop) about the AFBR.
   It keeps the mapping between the External-IP (E-IP) prefix and the
   Internal-IP (I-IP) address of the next hop.  The mappings determine
   which I-IP destination address will be used to encapsulate the
   received packet according to its E-IP destination address.  The
   definitions of E-IP and I-IP are explained in Section 4.1 of RFC 5565
   [RFC5565].  The number of entries in swmEncapsTable shows how many
   softwire mesh tunnels are maintained in this AFBR.

RFC 7856                    Softwire Mesh MIB                   May 2016


4.3.  The swmBGPNeighborTable Subtree

   This subtree provides the softwire mesh BGP neighbor information of
   an AFBR.  It includes the address of the softwire mesh BGP peer and
   the kind of tunnel that the AFBR would use to communicate with this
   BGP peer.

4.4.  The swmConformance Subtree

   This subtree provides the conformance information of MIB objects.

5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

5.1.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating logical interfaces
   (ifEntry).  Being a tunnel, the softwire mesh interface has an entry
   in the Interface MIB, as well as an entry in the IP Tunnel MIB.
   Those corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in the ifTable represents whether the mesh function
   of the AFBR has been triggered.  If the softwire mesh capability is
   negotiated during the BGP OPEN phase, the mesh function is considered
   to be started, and the ifOperStatus is "up".  Otherwise, the
   ifOperStatus is "down".

   In the case of an IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mesh tunnel, ifInUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv6 packets that are sent to the virtual
   interface for decapsulation into IPv4.  The ifOutUcastPkts counts the
   number of IPv6 packets that are generated by encapsulating IPv4
   packets sent to the virtual interface.  In particular, if these IPv4
   packets need fragmentation, ifOutUcastPkts counts the number of
   packets after fragmentation.

   In the case of an IPv6-over-IPv4 softwire mesh tunnel, ifInUcastPkts
   counts the number of IPv4 packets that are delivered to the virtual
   interface for decapsulation into IPv6.  The ifOutUcastPkts counts the
   number of IPv4 packets that are generated by encapsulating IPv6
   packets sent down to the virtual interface.  In particular, if these
   IPv6 packets need to be fragmented, ifOutUcastPkts counts the number
   of packets after fragmentation.  Similar definitions apply to other
   counter objects in the ifTable.

5.2.  Relationship to the IP Tunnel MIB

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] contains objects applicable to all IP
   tunnels, including softwire mesh tunnels.  Meanwhile, the Softwire
   Mesh MIB extends the IP Tunnel MIB to further describe encapsulation-
   specific information.

   When running a point-to-multipoint tunnel, it is necessary for a
   softwire mesh AFBR to maintain an encapsulation table in order to
   perform correct "forwarding" among AFBRs.  This forwarding function
   on an AFBR is performed by using the E-IP destination address to look
   up the I-IP encapsulation destination address in the encapsulation
   table.  An AFBR also needs to know the BGP peer information of the
   other AFBRs, so that it can negotiate the NLRI-NH information and the
   tunnel parameters with them.

   The Softwire Mesh MIB requires the implementation of the IP Tunnel
   MIB.  The tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the tunnelIfEntry MUST be set to
   softwireMesh(16), and a corresponding entry in the Softwire Mesh MIB
   module will be presented for the tunnelIfEntry.  The
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress MUST be set to "0.0.0.0" for IPv4 or "::"
   for IPv6 because it is a point-to-multipoint tunnel.

   The tunnelIfAddressType in the tunnelIfTable represents the type of
   address in the corresponding tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and
   tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects.  The tunnelIfAddressType is
   identical to swmEncapsIIPDstType in softwire mesh, which can support
   either IPv4-over-IPv6 or IPv6-over-IPv4.  When the
   swmEncapsEIPDstType is IPv6 and the swmEncapsIIPDstType is IPv4, the
   tunnel type is IPv6-over-IPv4; when the swmEncapsEIPDstType is IPv4
   and the swmEncapsIIPDstType is IPv6, the encapsulation mode is IPv4-
   over-IPv6.

5.3.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB
   [RFC4001].

7.  Security Considerations

   Because this MIB module reuses the IP Tunnel MIB, the security
   considerations of the IP Tunnel MIB are also applicable to the
   Softwire Mesh MIB.

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the objects and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   swmSupportedTunnelType, swmEncapsIIPDstType, swmEncapsIIPDst, and
   swmBGPNeighborTunnelType can expose the types of tunnels used within
   the internal network and potentially reveal the topology of the
   internal network.







Cui, et al.                  Standards Track                   [Page 13]

RFC 7856                    Softwire Mesh MIB                   May 2016


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated the following OBJECT IDENTIFIER value and recorded
   it in the SMI Numbers registry in the subregistry called "SMI Network
   Management MGMT Codes Internet-standard MIB" under the mib-2 branch
   (1.3.6.1.2.1):

           Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
           ----------        -----------------------
           swmMIB            { mib-2 239 }

   IANA has recorded the following IANAtunnelType Textual Convention
   within the IANAifType-MIB:

           IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
                 SYNTAX     INTEGER {
                            softwireMesh(16)  -- softwire mesh tunnel
                            }
