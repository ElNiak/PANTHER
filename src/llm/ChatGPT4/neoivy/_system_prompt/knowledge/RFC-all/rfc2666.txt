Abstract

   This memo defines OBJECT IDENTIFIER values for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
   contains registered OID values for use with the dot3StatsEtherChipSet
   object in the EtherLike-MIB [16].  These registrations have been
   split from [16] into a separate document for maintenance purposes.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines OBJECT IDENTIFIER values for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
   contains registered OID values for use with the dot3StatsEtherChipSet
   object in the EtherLike-MIB [16].  These registrations have been
   split from [16] into a separate document for maintenance purposes.

   The dot3StatsEtherChipSet object has recently been deprecated.  The
   purpose of this document is to capture historic assignments made by
   the various IETF working groups that have been responsible for
   maintaining the EtherLike-MIB.  Implementations which support the
   dot3StatsEtherChipSet object for backwards compatability may continue
   to use the OBJECT IDENTIFIER values assigned in this document.

   For those chipsets not represented in this document, implementors
   should assign OBJECT IDENTIFIER values within that part of the
   registration tree delegated to individual enterprises.

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
      1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
      [12].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [13].

RFC 2666                  Ethernet Chipset MIB               August 1999


   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

           DESCRIPTION "This MIB module contains registered values for
                       use by the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object in
                       the EtherLike-MIB.  This object is used to
                       identify the MAC hardware used to communicate
                       on an interface.

                       Note that the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object
                       has been deprecated.  The primary purpose of
                       this module is to capture historic assignments
                       made by the various IETF working groups that
                       have been responsible for maintaining the
                       EtherLike-MIB.  Implementations which support
                       the dot3StatsEtherChipSet object for backwards
                       compatability may continue to use these values.
                       For those chipsets not represented in this
                       module, registration is required in other
                       documentation, e.g., assignment within that
                       part of the registration tree delegated to
                       individual enterprises (see RFC 1155 and RFC
                       1902)."

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects actually defined in this MIB module.
   It merely contains a list of OBJECT IDENTIFIER values for use in
   other MIB modules.  As such, it does not, by itself, have any effect
   on the security of the Internet.

   The values in this module are expected to be used only for backwards
   compatability with the deprecated dot3StatsEtherChipSet object in the
   EtherLike-MIB [16].  That object may be considered sensitive in some
   environments, since it would allow an intruder to obtain information
   about which vendor's equipment is in use on the network.

   Therefore, it may be important in some environments, where the
   dot3StatsEtherChipSet object is implemented for backwards
   compatability, to control read access to that object and possibly to
   even encrypt the values of that object when sending it over the
   network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features for such
   a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to a managed object whose values are defined in
   this MIB, is properly configured to give access to those objects only
   to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access
   them.
