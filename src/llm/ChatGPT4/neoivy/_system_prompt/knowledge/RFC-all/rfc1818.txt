                         Best Current Practices

Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the
   Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document describes a new series of documents which describe best
   current practices for the Internet community.  Documents in this
   series carry the endorsement of the Internet Engineering Steering
   Group (IESG).

Discussion

   The current IETF process has two types of RFCs: standards track
   documents and other RFCs (e.g., informational, experimental, FYIs)
   [1].  The intent of the standards track documents is clear, and
   culminates in an official Internet Standard [2,3].  Informational
   RFCs can be published on a less formal basis, subject to the
   reasonable constraints of the RFC editor.  Informational RFCs are not
   subject to peer review and carry no significance whatsoever within
   the IETF process [4].

   The IETF currently has no other mechanism or means of publishing
   relevant technical information which it endorses.  This document
   creates a new subseries of RFCs, entitled Best Current Practices
   BCPs).

   The BCP process is similar to that for proposed standards.  The BCP
   is submitted to the IESG for review, and the existing review process
   applies, including a "last call" on the IETF announcement mailing
   list.  However, once the IESG has approved the document, the process
   ends and the document is published.  The resulting document is viewed
   as having the technical approval of the IETF, but it is not, and
   cannot become an official Internet Standard.

   Possible examples of technical information to which BCPs could be
   applied are "OSI NSAP Allocation" [5], and "OSPF Applicability
   Statement" [6].
