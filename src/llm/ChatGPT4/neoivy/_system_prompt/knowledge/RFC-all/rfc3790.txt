Abstract

   This document seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in
   currently deployed IETF Internet Area documented standards.  In order
   to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all IPv6
   Internet, many interim steps will be taken.  One of these steps is
   the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  It
   is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be
   redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will
   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards
   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be
   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document is part of a document set aiming to document all usage
   of IPv4 addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort to have the
   information in a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents
   conforming to the current IETF areas (Application, Internet,
   Management & Operations, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).

   This specific document focuses on usage of IPv4 addresses within the
   Internet area.

   For a full introduction, please see the introduction [1] document.

2.  Document Organization

   The following sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis
   of Full, Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each
   RFC is discussed in turn starting with RFC 1 and ending in (about)
   RFC 3100.  The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.  That is,
   each RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do
   not "look ahead" to see if any of the issues raised have already been
   fixed.

   Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,
   and 6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole
   and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are
   correlated.

3.  Full Standards

   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as
   "Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely
   implemented and used throughout the Internet.

3.1.  RFC 791 Internet Protocol

   This specification defines IPv4; IPv6 has been specified in separate
   documents.

3.2.  RFC 792 Internet Control Message Protocol

   This specification defines ICMP, and is inherently IPv4 dependent.

3.3.  RFC 826 Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


3.4.  RFC 891 DCN Local-Network Protocols

   There are many implicit assumptions about the use of IPv4 addresses
   in this document.

3.5.  RFC 894 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over
      Ethernet networks

   This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4
   packets over Ethernet.

3.6.  RFC 895 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over
      experimental Ethernet networks

   This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4
   packets over experimental Ethernet.

3.7.  RFC 903 Reverse Address Resolution Protocol

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.8.  RFC 919 Broadcasting Internet Datagrams

   This specification defines broadcasting for IPv4; IPv6 uses multicast
   so this is not applicable.

3.9.  RFC 922 Broadcasting Internet datagrams in the presence of subnets

   This specification defines how broadcasts should be treated in the
   presence of subnets.  IPv6 uses multicast so this is not applicable.

3.10.  RFC 950 Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure

   This specification defines IPv4 subnetting; similar functionality is
   part of IPv6 addressing architecture to begin with.

3.11.  RFC 1034 Domain Names: Concepts and Facilities

   In Section 3.6, "Resource Records", the definition of A record is:

      RDATA           which is the type and sometimes class dependent
                      data which describes the resource:

                      A          For the IN class, a 32 bit IP address

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


   And Section 5.2.1, "Typical functions" defines:

   1. Host name to host address translation.

      This function is often defined to mimic a previous HOSTS.TXT based
      function.  Given a character string, the caller wants one or more
      32 bit IP addresses.  Under the DNS, it translates into a request
      for type A RRs.  Since the DNS does not preserve the order of RRs,
      this function may choose to sort the returned addresses or select
      the "best" address if the service returns only one choice to the
      client.  Note that a multiple address return is recommended, but a
      single address may be the only way to emulate prior HOSTS.TXT
      services.

   2. Host address to host name translation

      This function will often follow the form of previous functions.
      Given a 32 bit IP address, the caller wants a character string.
      The octets of the IP address are reversed, used as name
      components, and suffixed with "IN-ADDR.ARPA".  A type PTR query is
      used to get the RR with the primary name of the host.  For
      example, a request for the host name corresponding to IP address
      1.2.3.4 looks for PTR RRs for domain name "4.3.2.1.IN-ADDR.ARPA".

   There are, of course, numerous examples of IPv4 addresses scattered
   throughout the document.

3.12.  RFC 1035 Domain Names: Implementation and Specification

   Section 3.4.1, "A RDATA format", defines the format for A records:

      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
      |                    ADDRESS                    |
      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

    where:

    ADDRESS         A 32 bit Internet address.

    Hosts that have multiple Internet addresses will have multiple A
    records.

    A records cause no additional section processing.  The RDATA section
    of an A line in a master file is an Internet address expressed as

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


   And Section 3.4.2, "WKS RDATA", format is:

      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
      |                    ADDRESS                    |

      /                   <BIT MAP>                   /

      /                                               /
      +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

    where:

    ADDRESS         An 32 bit Internet address

    PROTOCOL        An 8 bit IP protocol number

    <BIT MAP>       A variable length bit map.  The bit map
                    must be a multiple of 8 bits long.

    The WKS record is used to describe the well known services supported
    by a particular protocol on a particular internet address.  The
    PROTOCOL field specifies an IP protocol number, and the bit map has
    one bit per port of the specified protocol.  The first bit
    corresponds to port 0, the second to port 1, etc.  If the bit map
    does not include a bit for a protocol of interest, that bit is
    assumed zero.  The appropriate values and mnemonics for ports and
    protocols are specified in RFC1010.

    For example, if PROTOCOL=TCP (6), the 26th bit corresponds to TCP
    port 25 (SMTP).  If this bit is set, a SMTP server should be
    listening on TCP port 25; if zero, SMTP service is not supported on
    the specified address.

    The purpose of WKS RRs is to provide availability information for
    servers for TCP and UDP.  If a server supports both TCP and UDP, or
    has multiple Internet addresses, then multiple WKS RRs are used.

    WKS RRs cause no additional section processing.

   Section 3.5, "IN-ADDR.ARPA domain", describes reverse DNS lookups and
   is clearly IPv4 dependent.

   There are, of course, numerous examples of IPv4 addresses scattered
   throughout the document.

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


3.13.  RFC 1042 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over IEEE
       802 networks

   This specification specifically deals with the transmission of IPv4
   packets over IEEE 802 networks.

3.14.  RFC 1044 Internet Protocol on Network System's HYPERchannel:
       Protocol Specification

   There are a variety of methods used in this standard to map IPv4
   addresses to 32 bits fields in the HYPERchannel headers.  This
   specification does not support IPv6.

3.15.  RFC 1055 Nonstandard for transmission of IP datagrams over serial
       lines: SLIP

   This specification is more of an analysis of the shortcomings of SLIP
   which is unsurprising.  The introduction of PPP as a general
   replacement of SLIP has made this specification essentially unused.
   No update need be considered.

3.16.  RFC 1088 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams over
       NetBIOS networks

   This specification documents a technique to encapsulate IP packets
   inside NetBIOS packets.

   The technique presented of using NetBIOS names of the form
   IP.XX.XX.XX.XX will not work for IPv6 addresses since the length of
   IPv6 addresses will not fit within the NetBIOS 15 octet name
   limitation.

3.17.  RFC 1112 Host Extensions for IP Multicasting

   This specification defines IP multicast.  Parts of the document are
   IPv4 dependent.

3.18.  RFC 1132 Standard for the transmission of 802.2 packets over IPX
       networks

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.19.  RFC 1201 Transmitting IP traffic over ARCNET networks

   The major concerns of this specification with respect to IPv4
   addresses occur in the resolution of ARCnet 8bit addresses to IPv4
   addresses in an "ARPlike" method.  This is incompatible with IPv6.

3.20.  RFC 1209 The Transmission of IP Datagrams over the SMDS Service

   This specification defines running IPv4 and ARP over SMDS.  The
   methods described could easily be extended to support IPv6 packets.

3.21.  RFC 1390 Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks

   This specification defines the use of IPv4 address on FDDI networks.
   There are numerous IPv4 dependencies in the specification.

   In particular the value of the Protocol Type Code (2048 for IPv4) and
   a corresponding Protocol Address length (4 bytes for IPv4) needs to
   be created.  A discussion of broadcast and multicast addressing
   techniques is also included, and similarly must be updated for IPv6
   networks.  The defined MTU limitation of 4096 octets of data (with
   256 octets reserved header space) should remain sufficient for IPv6.

3.22.  RFC 1661 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.23.  RFC 1662 PPP in HDLC-like Framing

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.24.  RFC 2427 Multiprotocol Interconnect over Frame Relay

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.  Draft Standards

   Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple,
   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are
   usually quite mature and widely used.

4.1.  RFC 951 Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)

   This protocol is designed specifically for use with IPv4, for
   example:

    Section 3. Packet Format

    All numbers shown are decimal, unless indicated otherwise.  The
    BOOTP packet is enclosed in a standard IP UDP datagram.  For
    simplicity it is assumed that the BOOTP packet is never fragmented.
    Any numeric fields shown are packed in 'standard network byte
    order', i.e., high order bits are sent first.

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


    In the IP header of a bootrequest, the client fills in its own IP
    source address if known, otherwise zero.  When the server address is
    unknown, the IP destination address will be the 'broadcast address'
    255.255.255.255.  This address means 'broadcast on the local cable,
    (I don't know my net number)'.

        FIELD   BYTES   DESCRIPTION
        -----   -----   ---

    [...]
           ciaddr  4       client IP address;
                           filled in by client in bootrequest if known.

           yiaddr  4       'your' (client) IP address;
                           filled by server if client doesn't
                           know its own address (ciaddr was 0).

           siaddr  4       server IP address;
                           returned in bootreply by server.

           giaddr  4       gateway IP address,
                           used in optional cross-gateway booting.

    Since the packet format is a fixed 300 bytes in length, an updated
    version of the specification could easily accommodate an additional
    48 bytes (4 IPv6 fields of 16 bytes to replace the existing 4 IPv4
    fields of 4 bytes).

4.2.  RFC 1188 Proposed Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams
      over FDDI Networks

   This document is clearly informally superseded by RFC 1390,
   "Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks", even though no
   formal deprecation has been done.  Therefore, this specification is
   not considered further in this memo.

4.3.  RFC 1191 Path MTU discovery

   The entire process of PMTU discovery is predicated on the use of the
   DF bit in the IPv4 header, an ICMP message (also IPv4 dependent) and
   TCP MSS option.  This is not compatible with IPv6.

4.4.  RFC 1356 Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN

   Section 3.2 defines an NLPID for IP as follows:

      The value hex CC (binary 11001100, decimal 204) is IP.
      Conformance with this specification requires that IP be supported.

      See section 5.1 for a diagram of the packet formats.

      Clearly a new NLPID would need to be defined for IPv6 packets.

4.5.  RFC 1534 Interoperation Between DHCP and BOOTP

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.6.  RFC 1542 Clarifications and Extensions for the Bootstrap Protocol

   There are no new issues other than those presented in Section 4.1.

4.7.  RFC 1629 Guidelines for OSI NSAP Allocation in the Internet

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.8.  RFC 1762 The PPP DECnet Phase IV Control Protocol (DNCP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.9.  RFC 1989 PPP Link Quality Monitoring

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.10.  RFC 1990 The PPP Multilink Protocol (MP)

   Section 5.1.3, "Endpoint Discriminator Option", defines a Class
   header field:

   Class
      The Class field is one octet and indicates the identifier address
      space.  The most up-to-date values of the LCP Endpoint
      Discriminator Class field are specified in the most recent
      "Assigned Numbers" RFC.  Current values are assigned as follows:

      0    Null Class

      1    Locally Assigned Address

      2    Internet Protocol (IP) Address

      3    IEEE 802.1 Globally Assigned MAC Address

      4    PPP Magic-Number Block

      5    Public Switched Network Directory Number

   A new class field needs to be defined by the IANA for IPv6 addresses.

4.11.  RFC 1994 PPP Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.12.  RFC 2067 IP over HIPPI

   Section 5.1, "Packet Formats", contains the following excerpt:

    EtherType (16 bits) SHALL be set as defined in Assigned Numbers:  IP
    = 2048 ('0800'h), ARP = 2054 ('0806'h), RARP = 32,821 ('8035'h).

   Section 5.5, "MTU", has the following definition:

      The MTU for HIPPI-SC LANs is 65280 bytes.

      This value was selected because it allows the IP packet to fit in
      one 64K byte buffer with up to 256 bytes of overhead.  The
      overhead is 40 bytes at the present time; there are 216 bytes of
      room for expansion.

         HIPPI-FP Header                  8 bytes
         HIPPI-LE Header                 24 bytes
         IEEE 802.2 LLC/SNAP Headers      8 bytes
         Maximum IP packet size (MTU) 65280 bytes
                                      ------------
                           Total      65320 bytes (64K - 216)

   This definition is not applicable for IPv6 packets since packets can
   be larger than the IPv4 limitation of 65280 bytes.

4.13.  RFC 2131 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

   This version of DHCP is highly predicated of IPv4.  It is not
   compatible with IPv6.

4.14.  RFC 2132 DHCP Options and BOOTP Vendor Extensions

   This is an extension to an IPv4-only specification.

4.15.  RFC 2390 Inverse Address Resolution Protocol

4.16.  RFC 2460 Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification

   This document defines IPv6 and has no IPv4 issues.

4.17.  RFC 2461 Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)

   This document defines an IPv6 related specification and has no IPv4
   issues.

4.18.  RFC 2462 IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration

   This document defines an IPv6 related specification and has no IPv4
   issues.

4.19.  RFC 2463 Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the
       Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification

   This document defines an IPv6 related specification and has no IPv4
   issues.

4.20.  RFC 3596 DNS Extensions to support IP version 6

   This specification defines the AAAA record for IPv6 as well as PTR
   records using the ip6.arpa domain, and as such has no IPv6 issues.

5.  Proposed Standards

   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no
   requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases,
   Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards
   process.  They, therefore, are often just proposed ideas that are
   presented to the Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or
   they are one of many competing solutions to problems.  In these later
   cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose
   of this discussion.

5.1.  RFC 1234 Tunneling IPX traffic through IP networks

   The section "Unicast Address Mappings" has the following text:

    For implementations of this memo, the first two octets of the host
    number will always be zero and the last four octets will be the
    node's four octet IP address.  This makes address mapping trivial
    for unicast transmissions: the first two octets of the host number
    are discarded, leaving the normal four octet IP address.  The
    encapsulation code should use this IP address as the destination
    address of the UDP/IP tunnel packet.

   This mapping will not be able to work with IPv6 addresses.






Mickles & Nesser II          Informational                     [Page 18]

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


   There are also numerous discussions on systems keeping a "peer list"
   to map between IP and IPX addresses.  The specifics are not discussed
   in the document and are left to the individual implementation.

   The section "Maximum Transmission Unit" also has some implications on
   IP addressing:

    Although larger IPX packets are possible, the standard maximum
    transmission unit for IPX is 576 octets.  Consequently, 576 octets
    is the recommended default maximum transmission unit for IPX packets
    being sent with this encapsulation technique.  With the eight octet
    UDP header and the 20 octet IP header, the resulting IP packets will
    be 604 octets long.  Note that this is larger than the 576 octet
    maximum size IP implementations are required to accept.  Any IP
    implementation supporting this encapsulation technique must be
    capable of receiving 604 octet IP packets.

    As improvements in protocols and hardware allow for larger,
    unfragmented IP transmission units, the 576 octet maximum IPX packet
    size may become a liability.  For this reason, it is recommended
    that the IPX maximum transmission unit size be configurable in
    implementations of this memo.

5.2.  RFC 1256 ICMP Router Discovery Messages

   This specification defines a mechanism very specific to IPv4.

5.3.  RFC 1277 Encoding Network Addresses to Support Operation over
      Non-OSI Lower Layers

   Section 4.5, "TCP/IP (RFC 1006) Network Specific Format" describes a
   structure that reserves 12 digits for the textual representation of
   an IP address.

   This 12 octet field for decimal versions of IP addresses is
   insufficient for a decimal version of IPv6 addresses.  It is possible
   to define a new encoding using the 20 digit long IP Address + Port +
   Transport Set fields in order to accommodate a binary version of an
   IPv6 address, port number and Transport Set.  There are several
   schemes that could be envisioned.

5.4.  RFC 1332 The PPP Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)

   This specification defines a mechanism for devices to assign IPv4
   addresses to PPP clients once PPP negotiation is completed.  Section
   3, "IPCP Configuration Options", defines IPCP option types which
   embed the IP address in 4-byte long fields.  This is clearly not
   enough for IPv6.

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


   However, the specification is clearly designed to allow new Option
   Types to be added and Should offer no problems for use with IPv6 once
   appropriate options have been defined.

5.5.  RFC 1377 The PPP OSI Network Layer Control Protocol (OSINLCP)

      ar$spln -  length in octets of the source protocol address. Value
                 range is 0 or 4 (decimal).  For IPv4 ar$spln is 4.

      ar$tpln -  length in octets of the target protocol address. Value
                 range is 0 or 4 (decimal).  For IPv4 ar$tpln is 4.

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


      For backward compatibility with previous implementations, a null
      IPv4 protocol address may be received with length = 4 and an
      allocated address in storage set to the value 0.0.0.0.  Receiving
      stations must be liberal in accepting this format of a null IPv4

         Length is (n * 4) and the value is an array of n IP addresses,

         contains the addresses of n NetWare Domain SAP/RIP Server
         (DSS).

      NEAREST_NWIP_SERVER (code 7)

         Length is (n * 4) and the value is an array of n IP addresses,

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


5.36.  RFC 2290 Mobile-IPv4 Configuration Option for PPP IPCP

   This document is designed for use with Mobile IPv4.  There are
   numerous referrals to other IP "support" mechanisms (i.e., ICMP
   Router Discover Messages) that specifically refer to the IPv4 of
   ICMP.

5.37.  RFC 2308 Negative Caching of DNS Queries (DNS NCACHE)

   Although there are numerous examples in this document that use IPv4
   "A" records, there is nothing in the specification that limits its
   effectiveness to IPv4.

5.38.  RFC 2331 ATM Signaling Support for IP over ATM - UNI Signaling
       4.0 Update

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

5.39.  RFC 2332 NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)

   This document is very generic in its design and seems to be able to
   support numerous layer 3 addressing schemes and should include both

5.44.  RFC 2371 Transaction Internet Protocol Version 3.0 (TIPV3)

   This document states:

      TIP transaction manager addresses take the form:

         <hostport><path>

      The <hostport> component comprises:

         <host>[:<port>]

      where <host> is either a <dns name> or an <ip address>; and <port>
      is a decimal number specifying the port at which the transaction
      manager (or proxy) is listening for requests to establish TIP
      connections.  If the port number is omitted, the standard TIP port
      number (3372) is used.

      A <dns name> is a standard name, acceptable to the domain name
      service.  It must be sufficiently qualified to be useful to the
      receiver of the command.

      An <ip address> is an IP address, in the usual form: four decimal
      numbers separated by period characters.

   And further along it states:

      A TIP URL takes the form:

         tip://<transaction manager address>?<transaction string>

      where <transaction manager address> identifies the TIP transaction
      manager (as defined in Section 7 above); and <transaction string>
      specifies a transaction identifier, which may take one of two
      forms (standard or non-standard):

      i. "urn:" <NID> ":" <NSS>

      A standard transaction identifier, conforming to the proposed
      Internet Standard for Uniform Resource Names (URNs), as specified
      by RFC2141; where <NID> is the Namespace Identifier, and <NSS> is
      the Namespace Specific String.  The Namespace ID determines the
      syntactic interpretation of the Namespace Specific String.  The
      Namespace Specific String is a sequence of characters representing
      a transaction identifier (as defined by <NID>).  The rules for
      the contents of these fields are specified by RFC2141 (valid
      characters, encoding, etc.).

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


      This format of <transaction string> may be used to express global
      transaction identifiers in terms of standard representations.
      Examples for <NID> might be <iso> or <xopen>, e.g.,

         tip://123.123.123.123/?urn:xopen:xid

       Note that Namespace Ids require registration.

      ii. <transaction identifier>

      A sequence of printable ASCII characters (octets with values in
      the range 32 through 126 inclusive (excluding ":") representing a
      transaction identifier.  In this non-standard case, it is the
      combination of <transaction manager address> and <transaction
      identifier> which ensures global uniqueness, e.g.,

         tip://123.123.123.123/?transid1

        Protocol (BCP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

6.  Experimental RFCs

   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have wide
   scale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often
   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented
   to the Internet community in order to allow potential
   interoperability or some other potential useful scenario.  In a few
   cases they are presented as alternatives to the mainstream solution
   to an acknowledged problem.

6.1.  RFC 1149 Standard for the transmission of IP datagrams on avian
      carriers

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.  In fact the
   flexibility of this specification is such that all versions of IP
   should function within its boundaries, presuming that the packets
   remain small enough to be transmitted with the 256 milligrams weight
   limitations.

6.2.  RFC 1183 New DNS RR Definitions

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

   This specification defines a specification that assumes IPv4 but does
   not actually have any limitations which would limit its operation in
   an IPv6 environment.

6.5.  RFC 1307 Dynamically Switched Link Control Protocol

   This specification is IPv4 dependent, for example:

   This is incompatible with IPv6.

6.13.  RFC 1768 Host Group Extensions for CLNP Multicasting

   This specification defines multicasting for CLNP, which is not an IP

6.16.  RFC 1819 Internet Stream Protocol Version 2 (ST2) Protocol
       Specification - Version ST2+

   This specification is IPv4 limited.  In fact it is the definition of
   IPv5.  It has been abandoned by the IETF as feasible design, and is
   not considered in this discussion.

6.17.  RFC 1868 ARP Extension - UNARP

   This specification defines an extension to IPv4 ARP to delete entries
   from ARP caches on a link.

6.18.  RFC 1876 A Means for Expressing Location Information in the
       Domain Name System

   This document defines a methodology for applying this technology
   which is IPv4 dependent.  The specification itself has no IPv4
   dependencies.

6.19.  RFC 1888 OSI NSAPs and IPv6

   This is an IPv6 related document and is not discussed in this
   document.

6.20.  RFC 2009 GPS-Based Addressing and Routing

      The document states:

        The future version of IP (IP v6) will certainly have a
        sufficient number of bits in its addressing space to provide an
        address for even smaller GPS addressable units.  In this
        proposal, however, we assume the current version of IP (IP v4)
        and we make sure that we manage the addressing space more
        economically than that.  We will call the smallest GPS
        addressable unit a GPS-square.

      This specification does not seem to have real IPv4 dependencies.

6.21.  RFC 2143 Encapsulating IP with the SCSI

   This specification will only operate using IPv4.  As stated in the
   document:

      It was decided that the ten byte header offers the greatest
      flexibility for encapsulating version 4 IP datagrams for the
      following reasons: [...]

   This is incompatible with IPv6.

7.  Summary of the Results

   In the initial survey of RFCs 52 positives were identified out of a
   total of 186, broken down as follows:

         Standards:                        17 out of  24 or 70.83%
         Draft Standards:                   6 out of  20 or 30.00%
         Proposed Standards:               22 out of 111 or 19.91%
         Experimental RFCs:                 7 out of  31 or 22.58%

   Of those identified many require no action because they document
   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols
   that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.
   Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be
   updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not
   updated.

7.1.  Standards

7.1.1.  RFC 791 Internet Protocol

   RFC 791 has been updated in the definition of IPv6 in RFC 2460.

7.1.2.  RFC 792 Internet Control Message Protocol

   RFC 792 has been updated in the definition of ICMPv6 in RFC 2463.

7.1.3.  RFC 891 DCN Networks

   DCN has long since been ceased to be used, so this specification is
   no longer relevant.

7.1.4.  RFC 894 IP over Ethernet

   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2464, A Method for the
   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks.

7.1.5.  RFC 895 IP over experimental Ethernets

   It is believed that experimental Ethernet networks are not being used
   anymore, so the specification is no longer relevant.

7.1.6.  RFC 922 Broadcasting Internet Datagrams in the Presence of
        Subnets

   Broadcasting is not used in IPv6, but similar functionality has been
   included in RFC 3513, IPv6 Addressing Architecture.

   Broadcasting is not used in IPv6, but similar functionality has been
   included in RFC 3513, IPv6 Addressing Architecture.

7.1.8.  RFC 1034 Domain Names: Concepts and Facilities

   The problems have been fixed by defining new resource records for
   IPv6 addresses.

7.1.9.  RFC 1035 Domain Names: Implementation and Specification

   The problems have been fixed by defining new resource records for
   IPv6 addresses.

7.1.10.  RFC 1042 IP over IEEE 802

   over Token Ring Networks.

7.1.11.  RFC 1044 IP over HyperChannel

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.1.12.  RFC 1088 IP over NetBIOS

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.1.13.  RFC 1112 Host Extensions for IP Multicast

   The IPv4-specific parts of RFC 1112 have been updated in RFC 2710,
   Multicast Listener Discovery for IPv6.

7.1.14.  RFC 1122 Requirements for Internet Hosts

   RFC 1122 is essentially a requirements document for IPv4 hosts.
   Similar work is in progress [2].

7.1.15.  RFC 1201 IP over ARCNET

   This problem has been fixed by RFC 2497, A Method for the
   Transmission of IPv6 Packets over ARCnet Networks.

7.1.16.  RFC 1209 IP over SMDS

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.1.17.  RFC 1390 Transmission of IP and ARP over FDDI Networks

   Autoconfiguration, and RFC 3315, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   for IPv6 (DHCPv6).

7.2.2.  RFC 1191 Path MTU Discovery

   This problem has been fixed in RFC 1981, Path MTU Discovery for IP
   version 6.

7.2.3.  RFC 1356 Multiprotocol Interconnect on X.25 and ISDN

   This problem can be fixed by defining a new NLPID for IPv6.  Note
   that an NLPID has already been defined in RFC 2427, Multiprotocol
   Interconnect over Frame Relay.

7.2.4.  RFC 1990 The PPP Multilink Protocol (MP)

   A new class identifier ("6") for IPv6 packets has been registered
   with the IANA by the original author, fixing this problem.

7.2.5.  RFC 2067 IP over HIPPI

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.2.6.  RFC 2131 DHCP

   This problem has been fixed in RFC 3315, Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6).

   Further, the consensus of the DHC WG has been that the options
   defined for DHCPv4 will not be automatically "carried forward" to
   DHCPv6.  Therefore, any further analysis of additionally specified
   DHCPv4 Options has been omitted from this memo.

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.3.21.  RFC 3344 Mobility Support for IPv4

   The problems have been resolved by RFC 3775 and RFC 3776 [3, 4].

   Since the first Mobile IPv4 specification in RFC 2002, a number of
   extensions to it have been specified.  As all of these depend on
   MIPv4, they have been omitted from further analysis in this memo.

7.3.22.  RFC 3376 Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3

   This problem is being fixed by MLDv2 specification [5].

7.4.  Experimental RFCs

7.4.1.  RFC 1307 Dynamically Switched Link Control Protocol

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.4.2.  RFC 1393 Traceroute using an IP Option

   This specification relies on the use of an IPv4 option.  No
   replacement document exists, and it is unclear whether one is needed.

7.4.3.  RFC 1735 NBMA Address Resolution Protocol (NARP)

   This functionality has been defined in RFC 2491, IPv6 over Non-
   Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) networks and RFC 2332, NBMA Next Hop
   Resolution Protocol (NHRP).

7.4.4.  RFC 1788 ICMP Domain Name Messages

   No updated document exists for this specification.  However, DNS
   Dynamic Updates should provide similar functionality, so an update
   does not seem necessary.

RFC 3790        IPv4 Addresses in the IETF Internet Area       June 2004


7.4.5.  RFC 1868 ARP Extension - UNARP

   This mechanism defined a mechanism to purge ARP caches on a link.
   That functionality already exists in RFC 2461, Neighbor Discovery for
   IPv6.

7.4.6.  RFC 2143 IP Over SCSI

   No updated document exists for this specification.  It is unclear
   whether one is needed.

7.4.7.  RFC 3180 GLOP Addressing in 233/8

   Similar functionality is provided by RFC 3306, Unicast-Prefix-based
   IPv6 Multicast Addresses, and no action is necessary.

8.  Security Considerations

   This memo examines the IPv6-readiness of specifications; this does
   not have security considerations in itself.
