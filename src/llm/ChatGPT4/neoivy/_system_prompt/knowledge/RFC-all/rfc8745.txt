 Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for
  Associating Working and Protection Label Switched Paths (LSPs) with
                              Stateful PCE

Abstract

   An active stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) is capable of
   computing as well as controlling via Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic
   Engineering (MPLS-TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).  Furthermore, it
   is also possible for an active stateful PCE to create, maintain, and
   delete LSPs.  This document defines the PCEP extension to associate
   two or more LSPs to provide end-to-end path protection.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (PCEP) for communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a PCE or between a pair of PCEs as per [RFC4655].  A PCE computes
   paths for MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs) based on various
   constraints and optimization criteria.

   Stateful PCE [RFC8231] specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to
   enable stateful control of paths such as MPLS-TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657].  It includes
   mechanisms to affect LSP state synchronization between PCCs and PCEs,
   delegation of control of LSPs to PCEs, and PCE control of timing and
   sequence of path computations within and across PCEP sessions.  The
   focus is on a model where LSPs are configured on the PCC, and control
   over them is delegated to the stateful PCE.  Furthermore, [RFC8281]
   specifies a mechanism to dynamically instantiate LSPs on a PCC based
   on the requests from a stateful PCE or a controller using stateful
   PCE.

   Path protection [RFC4427] refers to a paradigm in which the working
   LSP is protected by one or more protection LSP(s).  When the working
   LSP fails, protection LSP(s) is/are activated.  When the working LSPs
   are computed and controlled by the PCE, there is benefit in a mode of
   operation where protection LSPs are also computed and controlled by
   the same PCE.  [RFC8051] describes the applicability of path
   protection in PCE deployments.

   This document specifies a stateful PCEP extension to associate two or
   more LSPs for the purpose of setting up path protection.  The
   extension defined in this document covers the following scenarios:

   *  A PCC initiates a protection LSP and retains the control of the
      LSP.  The PCC computes the path itself or makes a request for path
      computation to a PCE.  After the path setup, it reports the
      information and state of the path to the PCE.  This includes the
      association group identifying the working and protection LSPs.
      This is the passive stateful mode [RFC8051].

   *  A PCC initiates a protection LSP and delegates the control of the
      LSP to a stateful PCE.  During delegation, the association group
      identifying the working and protection LSPs is included.  The PCE
      computes the path for the protection LSP and updates the PCC with
      the information about the path as long as it controls the LSP.
      This is the active stateful mode [RFC8051].

   *  A protection LSP could be initiated by a stateful PCE, which
      retains the control of the LSP.  The PCE is responsible for
      computing the path of the LSP and updating to the PCC with the
      information about the path.  This is the PCE-Initiated mode
      [RFC8281].

   Note that a protection LSP can be established (signaled) before the
   failure (in which case the LSP is said to be either in standby mode
   [RFC4427] or a primary LSP [RFC4872]) or after failure of the
   corresponding working LSP (known as a secondary LSP [RFC4872]).
   Whether to establish it before or after failure is according to
   operator choice or policy.

   [RFC8697] introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs, which can then be used to define associations between a set of
   LSPs.  The mechanism is equally applicable to stateful PCE (active
   and passive modes) and stateless PCE.

   This document specifies a PCEP extension to associate one working LSP
   with one or more protection LSPs using the generic association
   mechanism.

   This document describes a PCEP extension to associate protection LSPs
   by creating the Path Protection Association Group (PPAG) and encoding
   this association in PCEP messages for stateful PCEP sessions.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms are used in this document:

      ERO:  Explicit Route Object

      LSP:  Label Switched Path

      PCC:  Path Computation Client

      PCE:  Path Computation Element

      PCEP:  Path Computation Element Communication Protocol

      PPAG:  Path Protection Association Group

      TLV:  Type, Length, and Value

3.  PCEP Extensions

3.1.  Path Protection Association Type

   As per [RFC8697], LSPs are not associated by listing the other LSPs
   with which they interact but, rather, by making them belong to an
   association group.  All LSPs join an association group individually.
   The generic ASSOCIATION object is used to associate two or more LSPs
   as specified in [RFC8697].  This document defines a new Association
   type called "Path Protection Association Type" of value 1 and a "Path
   Protection Association Group" (PPAG).  A member LSP of a PPAG can
   take the role of working or protection LSP.  A PPAG can have one
   working LSP and/or one or more protection LSPs.  The source,
   destination, Tunnel ID (as carried in LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV [RFC8231],
   with description as per [RFC3209]), and Protection Type (PT) (in Path
   Protection Association TLV) of all LSPs within a PPAG MUST be the
   same.  As per [RFC3209], a TE tunnel is used to associate a set of
   LSPs during reroute or to spread a traffic trunk over multiple paths.

   The format of the ASSOCIATION object used for PPAG is specified in
   [RFC8697].

   [RFC8697] specifies the mechanism for the capability advertisement of
   the Association types supported by a PCEP speaker by defining an
   ASSOC-Type-List TLV to be carried within an OPEN object.  This
   capability exchange for the Association type described in this
   document (i.e., Path Protection Association Type) MAY be done before
   using this association, i.e., the PCEP speaker MAY include the Path
   Protection Association Type (1) in the ASSOC-Type-List TLV before
   using the PPAG in the PCEP messages.

   This Association type is dynamic in nature and created by the PCC or
   PCE for the LSPs belonging to the same TE tunnel (as described in
   [RFC3209]) originating at the same head node and terminating at the
   same destination.  These associations are conveyed via PCEP messages
   to the PCEP peer.  As per [RFC8697], the association source is set to
   the local PCEP speaker address that created the association unless
   local policy dictates otherwise.  Operator-configured Association
   Range MUST NOT be set for this Association type and MUST be ignored.

3.2.  Path Protection Association TLV

   The Path Protection Association TLV is an optional TLV for use in the
   ASSOCIATION object with the Path Protection Association Type.  The
   Path Protection Association TLV MUST NOT be present more than once.
   If it appears more than once, only the first occurrence is processed
   and any others MUST be ignored.

   The Path Protection Association TLV follows the PCEP TLV format of
   [RFC5440].

   The Type (16 bits) of the TLV is 38.  The Length field (16 bits) has
   a fixed value of 4.

   The value is comprised of a single field, the Path Protection
   Association Flags (32 bits), where each bit represents a flag option.

   The format of the Path Protection Association TLV (Figure 1) is as
   follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Type = 38             |            Length = 4         |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   PT      |               Unassigned Flags                |S|P|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 1: Path Protection Association TLV Format

   Path Protection Association Flags (32 bits)

   The following flags are currently defined:

   *  Protecting (P): 1 bit - This bit is as defined in Section 14.1 of
      [RFC4872] to indicate if the LSP is a working (0) or protection
      (1) LSP.

   *  Secondary (S): 1 bit - This bit is as defined in Section 14.1 of
      [RFC4872] to indicate if the LSP is a primary (0) or secondary (1)
      LSP.  The S flag is ignored if the P flag is not set.

   *  Protection Type (PT): 6 bits - This field is as defined in
      Section 14.1 of [RFC4872] (as "LSP (Protection Type) Flags") to
      indicate the LSP protection type in use.  Any type already defined
      or that could be defined in the future for use in the RSVP-TE
      PROTECTION object is acceptable in this TLV unless explicitly
      stated otherwise.

   *  Unassigned bits are considered reserved.  They MUST be set to 0 on
      transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   If the TLV is missing in the PPAG ASSOCIATION object, it is
   considered that the LSP is a working LSP (i.e., as if the P bit is
   unset).

4.  Operation

   An LSP is associated with other LSPs with which it interacts by
   adding them to a common association group via the ASSOCIATION object.
   All procedures and error handling for the ASSOCIATION object is as
   per [RFC8697].

4.1.  State Synchronization

   During state synchronization, a PCC reports all the existing LSP
   states as described in [RFC8231].  The association group membership
   pertaining to an LSP is also reported as per [RFC8697].  This
   includes PPAGs.

4.2.  PCC-Initiated LSPs

   A PCC can associate a set of LSPs under its control for path
   protection purposes.  Similarly, the PCC can remove one or more LSPs
   under its control from the corresponding PPAG.  In both cases, the
   PCC reports the change in association to PCE(s) via a Path
   Computation Report (PCRpt) message.  A PCC can also delegate the
   working and protection LSPs to an active stateful PCE, where the PCE
   would control the LSPs.  The stateful PCE could update the paths and
   attributes of the LSPs in the association group via a Path
   Computation Update (PCUpd) message.  A PCE could also update the
   association to the PCC via a PCUpd message.  These procedures are
   described in [RFC8697].

   It is expected that both working and protection LSPs are delegated
   together (and to the same PCE) to avoid any race conditions.  Refer
   to [STATE-PCE-SYNC] for the problem description.

4.3.  PCE-Initiated LSPs

   A PCE can create/update working and protection LSPs independently.
   As specified in [RFC8697], Association Groups can be created by both
   the PCE and the PCC.  Furthermore, a PCE can remove a protection LSP
   from a PPAG as specified in [RFC8697].  The PCE uses PCUpd or Path
   Computation Initiate (PCInitiate) messages to communicate the
   association information to the PCC.

4.4.  Session Termination

   As per [RFC8697], the association information is cleared along with
   the LSP state information.  When a PCEP session is terminated, after
   expiry of State Timeout Interval at the PCC, the LSP state associated
   with that PCEP session is reverted to operator-defined default
   parameters or behaviors as per [RFC8231].  The same procedure is also
   followed for the association information.  On session termination at
   the PCE, when the LSP state reported by PCC is cleared, the
   association information is also cleared as per [RFC8697].  Where
   there are no LSPs in an association group, the association is
   considered to be deleted.

4.5.  Error Handling

   As per the processing rules specified in Section 6.4 of [RFC8697], if
   a PCEP speaker does not support this Path Protection Association
   Type, it would return a PCErr message with Error-Type 26 "Association
   Error" and Error-Value 1 "Association type is not supported".

   All LSPs (working or protection) within a PPAG MUST belong to the
   same TE tunnel (as described in [RFC3209]) and have the same source
   and destination.  If a PCEP speaker attempts to add or update an LSP
   to a PPAG and the Tunnel ID (as carried in the LSP-IDENTIFIERS TLV
   [RFC8231], with a description as per [RFC3209]) or source or
   destination of the LSP is different from the LSP(s) in the PPAG, the
   PCEP speaker MUST send PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association Error)
   [RFC8697] and Error-Value 9 (Tunnel ID or endpoints mismatch for Path
   Protection Association).  In case of Path Protection, an LSP-
   IDENTIFIERS TLV SHOULD be included for all LSPs (including Segment
   Routing (SR) [RFC8664]).  If the Protection Type (PT) (in the Path
   Protection Association TLV) is different from the LSPs in the PPAG,
   the PCEP speaker MUST send PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association
   Error) [RFC8697] and Error-Value 6 (Association information mismatch)
   as per [RFC8697].

   When the PCEP peer does not support the protection type set in PPAG,
   the PCEP peer MUST send PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association Error)
   [RFC8697] and Error-Value 11 (Protection type is not supported).

   A given LSP MAY belong to more than one PPAG.  If there is a conflict
   between any of the two PPAGs, the PCEP peer MUST send PCErr with
   Error-Type 26 (Association Error) [RFC8697] and Error-Value 6
   (Association information mismatch) as per [RFC8697].

   When the protection type is set to 1+1 (i.e., protection type=0x08 or
   0x10), there MUST be at maximum only one working LSP and one
   protection LSP within a PPAG.  If a PCEP speaker attempts to add
   another working/protection LSP, the PCEP peer MUST send PCErr with
   Error-Type 26 (Association Error) [RFC8697] and Error-Value 10
   (Attempt to add another working/protection LSP for Path Protection
   Association).

   When the protection type is set to 1:N (i.e., protection type=0x04),
   there MUST be at maximum only one protection LSP, and the number of
   working LSPs MUST NOT be more than N within a PPAG.  If a PCEP
   speaker attempts to add another working/protection LSP, the PCEP peer
   MUST send PCErr with Error-Type 26 (Association Error) [RFC8697] and
   Error-Value 10 (Attempt to add another working/protection LSP for
   Path Protection Association).

   During the make-before-break (MBB) procedure, two paths will briefly
   coexist.  The error handling related to the number of LSPs allowed in
   a PPAG MUST NOT be applied during MBB.

   All processing as per [RFC8697] continues to apply.

5.  Other Considerations

   The working and protection LSPs are typically resource disjoint
   (e.g., node, Shared Risk Link Group [SRLG] disjoint).  This ensures
   that a single failure will not affect both the working and protection
   LSPs.  The disjoint requirement for a group of LSPs is handled via
   another Association type called "Disjointness Association" as
   described in [PCEP-LSP-EXT].  The diversity requirements for the
   protection LSP are also handled by including both ASSOCIATION objects
   identifying both the protection association group and the disjoint
   association group for the group of LSPs.  The relationship between
   the Synchronization VECtor (SVEC) object and the Disjointness
   Association is described in Section 5.4 of [PCEP-LSP-EXT].

   [RFC4872] introduces the concept and mechanisms to support the
   association of one LSP to another LSP across different RSVP Traffic
   Engineering (RSVP-TE) sessions using the ASSOCIATION and PROTECTION
   object.  The information in the Path Protection Association TLV in
   PCEP as received from the PCE is used to trigger the signaling of the
   working LSP and protection LSP, with the Path Protection Association
   Flags mapped to the corresponding fields in the PROTECTION object in
   RSVP-TE.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Association Type

   This document defines a new Association type, originally defined in
   [RFC8697], for path protection.  IANA has assigned new value in the
   "ASSOCIATION Type Field" subregistry (created by [RFC8697]) as
   follows:

            +------+-----------------------------+-----------+
            | Type | Name                        | Reference |
            +======+=============================+===========+
            | 1    | Path Protection Association | RFC 8745  |
            +------+-----------------------------+-----------+

                     Table 1: ASSOCIATION Type Field

6.2.  Path Protection Association TLV

   This document defines a new TLV for carrying the additional
   information of LSPs within a path protection association group.  IANA
   has assigned a new value in the "PCEP TLV Type Indicators"
   subregistry as follows:

       +-------+---------------------------------------+-----------+
       | Value | Description                           | Reference |
       +=======+=======================================+===========+
       | 38    | Path Protection Association Group TLV | RFC 8745  |
       +-------+---------------------------------------+-----------+

                     Table 2: PCEP TLV Type Indicators

   Per this document, a new subregistry named "Path protection
   Association Group TLV Flag Field" has been created within the "Path
   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry to manage the
   Flag field in the Path Protection Association Group TLV.  New values
   are to be assigned by Standards Action [RFC8126].  Each bit should be
   tracked with the following qualities:

   *  Bit number (count from 0 as the most significant bit)

   *  Name of the flag

   *  Reference

               +------+-----------------------+-----------+
               | Bit  |          Name         | Reference |
               +======+=======================+===========+

6.3.  PCEP Errors

   This document defines new Error-Values related to path protection
   association for Error-type 26 "Association Error" defined in
   [RFC8697].  IANA has allocated new error values within the "PCEP-
   ERROR Object Error Types and Values" subregistry of the PCEP Numbers
   registry as follows:

   +------------+-------------+---------------------------+-----------+
   | Error-Type | Meaning     | Error-value               | Reference |
   +============+=============+===========================+===========+

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [RFC8231], [RFC8281], and
   [RFC5440] apply to the extensions described in this document as well.
   Additional considerations related to associations where a malicious
   PCEP speaker could be spoofed and could be used as an attack vector
   by creating associations are described in [RFC8697].  Adding a
   spurious protection LSP to the Path Protection Association group
   could give a false sense of network reliability, which leads to
   issues when the working LSP is down and the protection LSP fails as
   well.  Thus, securing the PCEP session using Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) [RFC8253], as per the recommendations and best current
   practices in BCP 195 [RFC7525], is RECOMMENDED.

8.  Manageability Considerations

8.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any control or
   policy requirements in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

8.2.  Information and Data Models

   [RFC7420] describes the PCEP MIB; there are no new MIB Objects for
   this document.

   The PCEP YANG module [PCEP-YANG] supports associations.

8.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

8.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new operation
   verification requirements in addition to those already listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].

8.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

8.6.  Impact on Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not have any impact on network
   operations in addition to those already listed in [RFC5440],
   [RFC8231], and [RFC8281].
