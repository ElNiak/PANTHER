            MIB Transfer from the IETF to the IEEE 802.3 WG

Abstract

   This document records the transfer of responsibility for the
   Ethernet-related MIB modules DOT3-OAM-MIB, SNMP-REPEATER-MIB,
   POWER-ETHERNET-MIB, DOT3-EPON-MIB, EtherLike-MIB, EFM-CU-MIB,
   ETHER-WIS, and MAU-MIB from the IETF to the IEEE 802.3 Working Group
   (WG).  This document also describes the procedures associated with
   the transfer in a similar way to how RFC 4663 records the transfer of
   the IETF Bridge MIB work to the IEEE 802.1 WG.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4663], published in September 2006, described a plan for
   transferring responsibility for four MIB modules related to bridges
   from the IETF to IEEE 802.1.  Some years later, responsibility for
   eight more MIB modules was transferred from the IETF Ethernet
   Interfaces and Hub MIB (hubmib) WG to the IEEE 802.3 WG.  The MIB
   modules concerned are tabulated below (Section 2).  [RFC4663] clearly
   enunciates the motivation for both transfers and also provides an
   introduction to IEEE standardization procedures.  The discussions of
   those topics will not be repeated here.

   The IEEE version of this second lot of transferred MIB modules was
   published as 802.3.1-2011 in February 2011.  The IEEE 802.3.1
   specification was subsequently updated.  The latest version, IEEE
   802.3.1-2013 [IEEE802.3.1-2013], is the basis for this document.

2.  IETF and Corresponding IEEE 802.3 MIB Modules

   This section tabulates the MIB modules that were transferred to IEEE
   802.3, identifying the IETF source document, the corresponding clause
   of [IEEE802.3.1-2013], and the location of the MIB itself in ASCII
   format.

3.  Procedural Aspects of the Transfer

3.1.  IEEE MIB Modules in ASCII Format

   The content of Section 2.2 of [RFC4663] is also accurate for this
   document.

RFC 7448         Transferring MIB Modules to IEEE 802.3    February 2015


3.2.  OID Registration for New MIB Modules

   The IEEE 802.3 WG adopted the approach recommended in Section 2.3 of
   [RFC4663] of developing an IEEE MIB module and defining new
   compliance clauses under the IEEE OID branch.  Information about the
   IEEE 802.3 Management Registration Arcs can be found at
   <http://www.ieee802.org/3/arcs/index.html>.

3.3.  Mailing List Discussions

   The Ethernet Interfaces and Hub MIB WG has completed its documents,
   and the WG was closed in September 2007.  The mailing list stayed
   open for a while and was closed a few years later.  The appropriate
   mailing list for IEEE 802.3 MIB modules discussion is
   STDS-802-3-MIB@LISTSERV.IEEE.ORG.

   To see general information about 802.3, including how they work and
   how to participate, go to <http://www.ieee802.org/3/>.

3.4.  IETF MIB Doctor Reviews

   The content of Section 5 of [RFC4663] is also accurate for this
   document, noting that from the point of view of the present document,
   802.3 should replace 802.1 wherever it occurs in the text.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document records the transfer of ownership of Ethernet-related
   MIB modules to IEEE 802.3.1 several years ago.  The transfer has no
   security implications.

   Thanks to Juergen Schoenwaelder and Howard Frazier for their reviews
   and comments on both the initial and the present versions of this
   document.  During WG Last Call, Warren Kumari caught a nit, and
   Thomas Petch raised the point of ownership versus responsibility that
   resulted in some wording changes in the Abstract and Introduction.
