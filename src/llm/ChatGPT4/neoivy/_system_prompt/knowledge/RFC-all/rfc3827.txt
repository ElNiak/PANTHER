Abstract

   The snoop file format provides a way to store and exchange datalink
   layer packet traces.  This document describes extensions to this file
   format to support new media.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC1761] defines the snoop file format used to store captured
   network packets for tools that capture, display, and interpret
   network traffic.  The file format specifies a header containing the
   Datalink Type field that identifies the network's datalink type.
   This document defines new values for this field, as well as an IANA
   registry for future datalink types.

2.  New Datalink Types

   In addition to the Datalink Type codes listed in [RFC1761], this
   document defines the following type codes for the corresponding
   media:

             Datalink Type           Code
             -------------           ----

             Fibre Channel           16
             ATM                     17
             ATM Classical IP        18
             IP over Infiniband      26

   The IP over Infiniband packet format is described in [IPoIB].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document created a new IANA registry named "Snoop Datalink
   Types" to hold the various possible 32-bit (4 octet) snoop datalink
   types.  This new registry holds the values previously defined in
   [RFC1761] and tabulated below:

             Datalink Type           Code
             -------------           ----

             IEEE 802.3              0
             IEEE 802.4 Token Bus    1
             IEEE 802.5 Token Ring   2
             IEEE 802.6 Metro Net    3
             Ethernet                4
             HDLC                    5
             Character Synchronous   6
             IBM Channel-to-Channel  7
             FDDI                    8
             Other                   9

   Additionally, the new registry also holds the values defined above in
   section 2 of this document.

   All new allocations and assignments to this registry starting from
   code 27 will follow the First Come First Served policy outlined in
   [BCP0026].  Type codes up to 26 not defined by this section of the
   document (10-15 and 19-25) are considered reserved.

4.  Security Considerations

   The addition of new datalink type codes to the existing file format
   poses no known security risks.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Strahm for meticulously reviewing this document.
