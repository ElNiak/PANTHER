RFC 3440                ADSL Line Extension MIB            December 2002


1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Introduction

   The purpose of this memo is to define a supplemental set of managed
   objects that is not covered by the ADSL Line MIB as defined in
   [RFC2662].  This memo addresses the additional objects defined in ITU
   G.997.1 [ITU G.997.1].

3.  Relationship of ADSL Line Extension MIB with standard MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of the ADSL Line Extension MIB
   with other MIBs described in RFCs and in their various degrees of
   standardization.  In regards to these relationships, the ADSL Line
   Extension MIB follows conventions as used by the ADSL Line MIB with
   one exception.  The value of the RFC 2863 object, ifOperstatus, SHALL
   be down(2) when the ADSL line interface is in power state L3, as
   defined in ITU G.992.1 [ITU G.992.1], which means no power.  Its
   value shall be up(1) if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0
   (power on) [ITU G.992.1] or L1 (reduced power).  Power Status L2 [ITU
   G.992.1] is not applicable.

4.  Conventions used in the MIB

4.1  Structure

   The MIB is organized to follow the same structure of the ADSL Line
   MIB [RFC2662].

4.2  Additional Managed Objects

   Objects specific to the management of ADSL G.Lite as defined in ITU
   G.992.2 [ITU G.992.2] are:

   - ADSL Transceiver Unit - Central Office End (ATU-C)
     Transmission System and Line Mode
   - Power Management
   - Counters for Fast Retrains and Failed Fast Retrains
   - Counters for Severe Error Second-line and Unavailable Second
   - Alternative profile configuration for the Dual line mode
     interface

   Besides the management of G.Lite, another object has been added in
   order to manage the ADSL line profile.  The object is the line mode
   configuration.

4.2.1 ATU-C ADSL Transmission System Parameters and Line Mode

   The adslLineConfigTable needs to be extended to cover control of the
   ATU-C ADSL Transmission system.  Three objects are defined to monitor
   and configure the transmission mode as well as the actual line mode:

     - Capability
     - Configuration
     - Actual Status

   Transmission modes can further determine the line mode of the ADSL
   interface.  For example, if g9921PotsNonOverlapped(2) is the actual
   value of the ADSL interface, the interface is operating in Full rate
   ADSL.  If the interface is set to g9922PotsOverlapped(9), the
   interface is operating in G.Lite mode.

RFC 3440                ADSL Line Extension MIB            December 2002


   The transmission mode and the corresponding line mode are defined as:

        Transmission mode                        Line Mode
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        Regional Std. (ANSI T1.413)              Full
           [ANSI T1.413]
        Regional Std. (ETSI DTS/TM06006)         Full
           [ETSI DTS/TM06006]
        G.992.1 [ITU G992.1] POTS non-overlapped Full
        G.992.1 POTS overlapped                  Full
        G.992.1 Integrated Services Digital
           Network (ISDN) non-overlapped         Full
        G.992.1 ISDN overlapped                  Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN non-overlapped          Full
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN overlapped              Full
        G.992.2 POTS non-overlapped              G.Lite
        G.992.2 POTS overlapped                  G.Lite
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN                    G.Lite
            non-overlapped
        G.992.2 with TCM-ISDN overlapped         G.Lite
        G.992.1 TCM-ISDN symmetric               Full

                Table 1: Transmission Mode and Line Mode

   In case more than one bit is configured for an ADSL interface and
   both Full and G.Lite modes are selected, the interface is said to be
   configured in the dual mode.  Only one bit can be set in the Actual
   object that reflects the actual mode of transmission as well as the
   line mode.

4.2.2 Power Management

   There are three possible power states for each managed ADSL interface
   operating in the G.Lite mode.  L0 is power on, L1 is power on but
   reduced and L3 is power off.  Power state cannot be configured by an
   operator but it can be viewed via the ifOperStatus object for the
   managed ADSL interface.  The value of the object ifOperStatus is set
   to down(2) if the ADSL interface is in power state L3 and is set to
   up(1) if the ADSL line interface is in power state L0 or L1.

   An ADSL line power state, if the interface is operating in the G.Lite
   mode, can also be monitored by the adslLineGlitePowerState object
   defined in the ADSL Line Extension table.  The value of the object
   enumerates the three power states attainable by the managed
   interface.

4.2.3 Fast Retrain Parameters

   Section 7.4.15 [ITU G.997.1] specifies fast retrain parameters.  Fast
   retrain parameters include two counters: fast retrain count and
   failed fast retrain count.  These two counters have been added to all
   performance tables.

4.2.4 Counters for Severely Errored Second-line and Unavailable
      Seconds-line

   ITU G.997.1 sections 6.2.1.1.7 and 6.2.1.1.9 specify two counters
   that are not covered by the ADSL Line MIB [RFC2662].  These two
   counters (severely errored seconds-line and unavailable seconds-line)
   are added to all the performance tables.

   Unavailable seconds counts the cumulative number of seconds in which
   the interface was unavailable during the measured period.  This
   counter does not include the seconds in which unavailability was
   caused solely by fast retrains and failed fast retrains.  Fast
   retrains and failed fast retrains are considered to be part of the
   normal network operation and thus are not counted as unavailable
   errors.

4.2.5  Counters, Interval Buckets and Thresholds

   For physical-level events, there are counters, current 15-minute and
   one (up to 96) 15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as
   well as current and previous 1-day interval-counters.   Threshold
   notification can be configured for each physical-layer current 15-
   minute bucket.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute and any wall clock; however
   some implementations may align the fifteen-minute intervals with
   quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
   day intervals with start of a day.

   Separate tables are provided for the 96 interval-counters.  They are
   indexed by {ifIndex, AdslAtu*IntervalNumber}.

   Counters are not reset when an ATU-C or ATU-R is reinitialized, only
   when the agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request
   outside the scope of this MIB).

   The 15-minute event counters are of the type PerfCurrentCount and
   PerfIntervalCount.  The 1-day event counters are of the type
   AdslPerfCurrDayCount and AdslPerfPrevDayCount.  Both 15-minute and 1-
   day time elapsed counters are of the type AdslPerfTimeElapsed.

4.2.6 Alternative profile configuration for the dual line mode interface

   The object, adslLineConfProfileDualLite, is used only when the
   interface (the ADSL line and, if applicable, channel) is configured
   as dual mode, that is, the object adslLineTransAtucConfig is
   configured with one or more full-rate modes and one or more G.Lite
   modes.

   The object adslLineConfProfile defined in ADSL-MIB [RFC2662] is used
   as the primary full-rate profile.  The newly added object in this MIB
   module, adslLineConfProfileDualLite, is used to describe and
   configure the G.Lite profile.  Note that if one or more full-rate
   modes are configured, or only G.Lite modes are configured, only the
   original full-rate profile is needed.  The dual-mode profile object
   is only needed when both full-rate and G.Lite profiles are needed.
   In this case, it will be set to the value of adslLineConfProfile when
   'dynamic' profiles are implemented.

   When 'static' profiles are implemented, however, similar to the case
   of the object, adslLineConfProfileName [RFC2662], this object's value
   will need to algorithmically represent the line.  In this case, the
   value of the line's ifIndex plus a value indicating the line mode
   type (e.g., G.Lite, Full-rate) will be used.  Therefore, the
   profile's name is a string of the concatenation of the ifIndex and
   one of the following values: Full or Lite.  This string will be
   fixed-length (i.e., 14) with leading zero(s).  For example, the
   profile name for ifIndex that equals '15' and is a full rate line
   will be '0000000015Full'.

                  associated channels (when applicable) for cases
                  when it is configured in dual mode, and operating
                  in a G.Lite-type mode as denoted by
                  adslLineTransAtucActual.  Dual mode exists when the
                  object, adslLineTransAtucConfig, is configured with
                  one or more full-rate modes and one or more G.Lite
                  modes simultaneously.

                  When 'dynamic' profiles are implemented, the value
                  of object is equal to the index of the applicable
                  row in the ADSL Line Configuration Profile Table,
                  AdslLineConfProfileTable defined in ADSL-MIB
                  [RFC2662].

                  In the case when dual-mode has not been enabled,
                  the value of the object will be equal to the value
                  of the object adslLineConfProfile [RFC2662].

                  When `static' profiles are implemented, in much
                  like the case of the object,
                  adslLineConfProfileName [RFC2662], this object's
                  value will need to algorithmically represent the
                  characteristics of the line.  In this case, the
                  value of the line's ifIndex plus a value indicating
                  the line mode type (e.g., G.Lite, Full-rate) will
                  be used. Therefore, the profile's name is a string
                  concatenating the ifIndex and one of the follow
                  values: Full or Lite. This string will be
                  fixed-length (i.e., 14) with leading zero(s).  For
                  example, the profile name for ifIndex that equals
                  '15' and is a full rate line, it will be
                  '0000000015Full'."

9.  Security Considerations

   The following security matters should be considered when implementing
   this MIB.

   1) Blocking unauthorized access to the ADSL MIB via the element
      management system is outside the scope of this document.  It
      should be noted that access to the MIB permits the unauthorized
      entity to modify the profiles (section 6.4) such that both
      subscriber service and network operations can be interfered with.



Ly & Bathrick               Standards Track                    [Page 32]

RFC 3440                ADSL Line Extension MIB            December 2002


      Subscriber service can be altered by modifying any of a number of
      service characteristics such as rate partitioning and maximum
      transmission rates.  Network operations can be impacted by
      modifying notification thresholds such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio
      (SNR) margins.

   2) SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
      network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no
      control over who on the secure network is allowed to access and
      GET (read) the objects in this MIB.  It is recommended that the
      implementors consider the security features as provided by the
      SNMPv3 framework.   Specifically, the use of the User-based
      Security Model STD 62, RFC 3414 [RFC3414] and the View-based
      Access Control Model STD 62, RFC 3415 [RFC3415] is recommended.

      It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
      entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
      configured to give access to only those objects, and to those
      principals (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

   3) The profile mechanism presented in this document requires specific
      attention.  The implementor of this MIB has a choice of
      implementing either 'static' or 'dynamic' profiles.  This decision
      must be consistent with the implementation of RFC 2662.

      In the case of 'static' profiles, the elements of the profile are
      read-write, as opposed to read-create when 'dynamic' profiles are
      implemented:

         - adslConfProfileLineType,
         - adslAtucThreshold15MinFailedFastR,
         - adslAtucThreshold15MinSesL,
         - adslAtucThreshold15MinUasL,
         - adslAturThreshold15MinSesL, and
         - adslAturThreshold15MinUasL.

      This decision also impacts the mechanics of the index,
      adslLineConfProfileDualLite.  When 'static' profiles are
      implemented, its value is algorithmically set by the system and
      its value is based on the ifIndex.  Hence it is not guaranteed
      across system reboots.  Similar to the handling of
      adslLineConfProfile [RFC2662], the implementor of this MIB must
      ensure that the profile object values associated with these
      indices are maintained across system reboots.

RFC 3440                ADSL Line Extension MIB            December 2002


      In the case of dynamic profiles, this object is set by the SNMP
      manager.  The implementor of this MIB may want to provide a view
      of the profile on a customer-by-customer standpoint, but should be
      cautious of the dynamic nature of these objects.

      4) ADSL layer connectivity from the ATU-R will permit the
      subscriber to manipulate both the ADSL link directly and the ADSL
      overhead control channel(AOC)/embedded operations channel (EOC)
      for their own loop.  For example,  unchecked or unfiltered
      fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate sufficient
      notifications to potentially overwhelm either the management
      interface to the network or the element manager.  Other attacks
      affecting the ATU-R portions of the MIB may also be possible.
