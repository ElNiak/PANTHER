1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) [RFC7921] provides read
   and write access to the information and state within the routing
   process that exists inside the routing elements; this is achieved via
   protocol message exchange between I2RS clients and I2RS agents
   associated with the routing system.  One of the functions of I2RS is
   to read and write data of the Routing Information Base (RIB).
   [I2RS-REQS] introduces a set of RIB use cases.  The RIB information
   model is defined in [RFC8430].

   This document defines a YANG data model [RFC7950] [RFC6991] for the
   RIB that satisfies the RIB use cases and aligns with the RIB
   information model.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Definitions and Abbreviations

   RIB: Routing Information Base

   FIB: Forwarding Information Base

   RPC: Remote Procedure Call

   IM: Information Model.  An abstract model of a conceptual domain,
   which is independent of a specific implementation or data
   representation.

1.3.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  Model Structure

   The following figure shows an overview of the structure tree of the
   ietf-i2rs-rib module.  To give a whole view of the structure tree,
   some details of the tree are omitted.  The relevant details are
   introduced in the subsequent subsections.

2.1.  RIB Capability

   RIB capability negotiation is very important because not all of the
   hardware will be able to support all kinds of nexthops, and there
   might be a limitation on how many levels of lookup can be practically
   performed.  Therefore, a RIB data model needs to specify a way for an
   external entity to learn about the functional capabilities of a
   network device.

   At the same time, nexthop chains can be used to specify multiple
   headers over a packet before that particular packet is forwarded.
   Not every network device will be able to support all kinds of nexthop
   chains along with the arbitrary number of headers that are chained
   together.  The RIB data model needs a way to expose the nexthop
   chaining capability supported by a given network device.

   This module uses the feature and if-feature statements to achieve
   above capability advertisement.

2.2.  Routing Instance and RIB

   A routing instance, in the context of the RIB information model, is a
   collection of RIBs, interfaces, and routing protocol parameters.  A
   routing instance creates a logical slice of the router and can allow
   multiple different logical slices, across a set of routers, to
   communicate with each other.  The routing protocol parameters control
   the information available in the RIBs.  More details about a routing
   instance can be found in Section 2.2 of [RFC8430].

   For a routing instance, there can be multiple RIBs.  Therefore, this
   model uses "list" to express the RIBs.  The structure tree is shown
   below:

   +--rw routing-instance
      +--rw name              string
      +--rw interface-list* [name]
      |  +--rw name if:interface-ref
      +--rw router-id?        yang:dotted-quad
      +--rw lookup-limit?     uint8
      +--rw rib-list* [name]
         +--rw name            string
         +--rw address-family      address-family-definition
         +--rw ip-rpf-check?   boolean
         +--rw route-list* [route-index]
            ... // refer to Section 2.3

2.3.  Route

   A route is essentially a match condition and an action following that
   match.  The match condition specifies the kind of route (e.g., IPv4,
   MPLS, Media Access Control (MAC), Interface, etc.) and the set of
   fields to match on.

   A route MUST contain the ROUTE_PREFERENCE attribute (see Section 2.3
   of [RFC8430]).

   In addition, a route MUST associate with the following status
   attributes in responses to a RIB writing/reading operation:

   o  Active: Indicates whether a route has at least one fully resolved
      nexthop and is therefore eligible for installation in the FIB.

   o  Installed: Indicates whether the route got installed in the FIB.

   o  Reason: Indicates the specific reason that caused the failure,
      e.g., "Not authorized".

   In addition, a route can be associated with one or more optional
   route-attributes (e.g., route-vendor-attributes).

   A RIB will have a number of routes, so the routes are expressed as a
   list under a specific RIB.  Each RIB has its own route list.

2.4.  Nexthop

   A nexthop represents an object resulting from a route lookup.  As
   illustrated in Figure 4 of [RFC8430], to support various use cases
   (e.g., load-balancing, protection, multicast, or a combination of
   them), the nexthop is modeled as a multilevel structure and supports
   recursion.  The first level of the nexthop includes the following
   four types:

   o  Base: The "base" nexthop is the foundation of all other nexthop
      types.  It includes the following basic nexthops:

      *  nexthop-id

      *  IPv4 address

      *  IPv6 address

      *  egress-interface

      *  egress-interface with IPv4 address

      *  egress-interface with IPv6 address

      *  egress-interface with MAC address

      *  logical-tunnel

      *  tunnel-encapsulation

      *  tunnel-decapsulation

      *  rib-name

   o  Chain: The "chain" nexthop provides a way to perform multiple
      operations on a packet by logically combining them.

   o  Load-Balance: The "load-balance" nexthop is designed for a load-
      balance case where it normally will have multiple weighted
      nexthops.

   o  Protection: The "protection" nexthop is designed for a protection
      scenario where it normally will have primary and standby nexthop.

   o  Replicate: The "replicate" nexthop is designed for multiple
      destinations forwarding.

2.5.  RPC Operations

   This module defines the following RPC operations:

   o  rib-add: Add a RIB to a routing instance.  The following are
      passed as the input parameters: the name of the RIB, the address
      family of the RIB, and (optionally) whether the RPF check is
      enabled.  The output is the result of the add operation:

      *  true - success

      *  false - failed (when failed, the I2RS agent may return the
         specific reason that caused the failure)












Wang, et al.                 Standards Track                   [Page 15]

RFC 8431                     RIB Data Model               September 2018


   o  rib-delete: Delete a RIB from a routing instance.  When a RIB is
      deleted, all routes installed in the RIB will be deleted.  A rib-
      name is passed as the input parameter.  The output is the result
      of the delete operation:

      *  true - success

      *  false - failed (when failed, the I2RS agent may return the
         specific reason that caused the failure)

   o  route-add: Add a route or a set of routes to a RIB.  The following
      are passed as the input parameters: the name of the RIB, the route
      prefix(es), the route-attributes, the route-vendor-attributes, the
      nexthop, and the "whether to return failure details" indication.
      Before calling the route-add rpc, it is required to call the nh-
      add rpc to create and/or return the nexthop identifier.  However,
      in situations when the nexthop already exists and the nexthop-id
      is known, this action is not expected.  The output is a
      combination of the route operation states while querying the
      appropriate node in the data tree, which includes:

      *  success-count: the number of routes that were successfully
         added;

      *  failed-count: the number of the routes that failed to be added;
         and,

      *  failure-detail: this shows the specific routes that failed to
         be added.

   o  route-delete: Delete a route or a set of routes from a RIB.  The
      following are passed as the input parameters: the name of the RIB,
      the route prefix(es), and the "whether to return failure details"
      indication.  The output is a combination of route operation

   o  route-update: Update a route or a set of routes.  The following
      are passed as the input parameters: the name of the RIB, the route
      prefix(es), the route-attributes, the route-vendor-attributes, or
      the nexthop.  The match conditions can be either route prefix(es),
      route-attributes, route-vendor-attributes, or nexthops.  The
      update actions include the following: update the nexthops, update
      the route-attributes, and update the route-vendor-attributes.  The
      output is a combination of the route operation states, which
      includes:

      *  success-count: the number of routes that were successfully
         updated;

      *  failed-count: the number of the routes that failed to be
         updated; and,

      *  failure-detail: this shows the specific routes that failed to
         be updated.

   o  nh-add: Add a nexthop to a RIB.  The following are passed as the
      input parameters: the name of the RIB and the nexthop.  The
      network node is required to allocate a nexthop identifier to the
      nexthop.  The outputs include the result of the nexthop add
      operation.

      *  true - success (when success, a nexthop identifier will be
         returned to the I2RS client)

      *  false - failed (when failed, the I2RS agent may return the
         specific reason that caused the failure)

   o  nh-delete: Delete a nexthop from a RIB.  The following are passed
      as the input parameters: the name of the RIB and a nexthop or
      nexthop identifier.  The output is the result of the delete
      operation:

      *  true - success

      *  false - failed (when failed, the I2RS agent may return the
         specific reason that caused the failure)

2.6.  Notifications

   Asynchronous notifications are sent by the RIB manager of a network
   device to an external entity when some event triggers on the network
   device.  An implementation of this RIB data model MUST support
   sending two kinds of asynchronous notifications.

   1.  Route change notification:

   o Installed (indicates whether the route got installed in the FIB)

   o Active (indicates whether a route has at least one fully resolved
   nexthop and is therefore eligible for installation in the FIB)

   o Reason (e.g., "Not authorized")

   2.  Nexthop resolution status notification

   Nexthops can be fully resolved or unresolved.

   A resolved nexthop has an adequate level of information to send the
   outgoing packet towards the destination by forwarding it on an
   interface to a directly connected neighbor.

   An unresolved nexthop is something that requires the RIB manager to
   determine the final resolved nexthop.  In one example, a nexthop
   could be an IP address.  The RIB manager would resolve how to reach
   that IP address, e.g., by checking if that particular IP address is
   reachable by regular IP forwarding, by an MPLS tunnel, or by both.
   If the RIB manager cannot resolve the nexthop, then the nexthop
   remains in an unresolved state and is NOT a suitable candidate for
   installation in the FIB.

   An implementation of this RIB data model MUST support sending route-
   change notifications whenever a route transitions between the
   following states:

   o  from the active state to the inactive state

   o  from the inactive state to the active state

   o  from the installed state to the uninstalled state

   o  from the uninstalled state to the installed state

   A single notification MAY be used when a route transitions from
   inactive/uninstalled to active/installed or in the other direction.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the "ns" registry within the "IETF
   XML Registry" [RFC3688]:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2rs-rib
    Registrant Contact: The IESG.
    XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document registers a YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC7950]:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    name:         ietf-i2rs-rib
    namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2rs-rib
    prefix:       iir
    reference:    RFC 8431
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The YANG module defines information that can be configurable in
   certain instances, for example, a RIB, a route, a nexthop can be
   created or deleted by client applications; the YANG module also
   defines RPCs that can be used by client applications to add/delete
   RIBs, routes, and nexthops.  In such cases, a malicious client could
   attempt to remove, add, or update a RIB, a route, or a nexthop by
   creating or deleting corresponding elements in the RIB, route, and

   nexthop lists, respectively.  Removing a RIB or a route could lead to
   disruption or impact in performance of a service; updating a route
   may lead to suboptimal path and degradation of service levels as well
   as possibly disruption of service.  For those reasons, it is
   important that the NETCONF access control model is vigorously applied
   to prevent misconfiguration by unauthorized clients.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  RIB: A malicious client could attempt to remove a RIB from a
      routing instance, for example, in order to sabotage the services
      provided by the RIB or to add a RIB to a routing instance (hence,
      to inject unauthorized traffic into the nexthop).

   o  route: A malicious client could attempt to remove or add a route
      from/to a RIB, for example, in order to sabotage the services
      provided by the RIB.

   o  nexthop: A malicious client could attempt to remove or add a
      nexthop from/to RIB, which may lead to a suboptimal path, a
      degradation of service levels, and a possible disruption of
      service.
