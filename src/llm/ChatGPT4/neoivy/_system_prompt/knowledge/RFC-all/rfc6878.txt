RFC 6878           SIP Priority Header Field Registry         March 2013


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a new IANA registry to keep track of the values
   defined for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) "Priority" header
   field.  This header field was defined in [RFC3261], Section 20.26.
   It was clearly specified in a way that allows for the creation of new
   values beyond those originally specified; however, no registry has
   been established for it.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds a new sub-registry, "Priority Header Field
   Values", to the "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Parameters"
   registry page.  Its format and initial values are as shown in the
   following table:

                        +------------+-----------+
                        | Priority   | Reference |
                        +------------+-----------+
                        | non-urgent | RFC 3261  |
                        | normal     | RFC 3261  |
                        | urgent     | RFC 3261  |
                        | emergency  | RFC 3261  |
                        +------------+-----------+

   The policy for registration of values in this registry is "IETF
   Review" as that term is defined by [RFC5226].  This policy was chosen
   over lighter-weight policies due the potential architectural impact
   of the semantics associated with new values.  Efforts contemplating
   adding a Priority value should consider whether the SIP Resource-
   Priority [RFC4412] or even a different protocol would be more
   appropriate for achieving their requirements.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have any impact on the security of the SIP
   protocol.  Its purpose is purely administrative in nature.
