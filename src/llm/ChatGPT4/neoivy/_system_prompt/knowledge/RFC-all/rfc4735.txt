              Example Media Types for Use in Documentation

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document is registration for the 'example' media type and
   'example' subtypes within the standards tree.  The 'example/*' and
   '*/example' media types are defined for documentation purposes only.

1.  Introduction

   From time to time, documents created by the IETF or by other
   standards bodies show examples involving the use of media types,
   where the actual media type is not relevant.  It would be useful in
   such cases to be able to show a media type whose illustrative role in
   the example is clear.  In the worst case, this can be useful to debug
   implementations where the designer mistook the example for a
   requirement of the protocol concerned.

   To meet this need, this document registers the following media types:

   o  the 'example' media type;

   o  the 'application/example', 'audio/example', 'image/example',
      'message/example', 'model/example', 'multipart/example',
      'text/example', and 'video/example' media subtypes.

   It is suggested that compilers of illustrative examples involving
   media types in trees other than the standards tree might also
   incorporate the string "example" into their hypothetical media types.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Registration of the 'example' Media Type

   This section registers the 'example' media type in accordance with
   the requirements of RFC 4288.

   Type name: example.

   Subtype name: any subtype may be used with the 'example' type.
   However, IANA MUST NOT register any subtypes for the 'example' media
   type.


   Required parameters: as invented by the user.

   Optional parameters: as invented by the user.

   Encoding considerations: as invented by the user.

   Security considerations: The 'example' media type is defined for use
   in documentation only.  It MUST NOT be implemented.  Its appearance
   in real code could lead to unpredictable results and therefore open
   up security holes.

   Interoperability considerations: Any attempt to negotiate or send the
   'example' media type is bound to lead to interoperability problems.

   Published specification: this document.

   Applications that use this media type: as invented by the user.

   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): not applicable.
      File extension(s): not applicable.
      Macintosh file type code(s): not applicable.

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
   ietf-types@iana.org.

   Intended usage: LIMITED USE.

   Restrictions on usage: This type is intended only for use in
   documents providing examples involving specification of some media
   type, where the actual media type used is irrelevant.

4.  Registration of the 'application/example', 'audio/example',
    'image/example', 'message/example', 'model/example',
    'multipart/example', 'text/example', and 'video/example' Subtypes

    This section registers 'example' media subtypes in accordance with
    the requirements of RFC 4288.

    Type name: 'application', 'audio', 'image', 'message', 'model',
    'multipart', 'text', and 'video'.

    Subtype name: 'example'.

    Required parameters: those required by the type and any others as
    invented by the user.

    Optional parameters: those offered by the type and any others as
    invented by the user.

    Encoding considerations: as invented by the user.

    Security considerations: The 'example' media subtypes are defined
    for use in documentation only.  They MUST NOT be implemented.  Their
    appearance in real code could lead to unpredictable results and
    therefore open up security holes.

    Interoperability considerations: Any attempt to negotiate or send
    one of these 'example' media subtypes is bound to lead to
    interoperability problems.

    Published specification: this document.

    Applications that use this media type: as invented by the user.

   Additional information:
      Magic number(s): not applicable.
      File extension(s): not applicable.
      Macintosh file type code(s): not applicable.

   Person & email address to contact for further information:
   ietf-types@iana.org.

   Intended usage: LIMITED USE.

   Restrictions on usage: These subtypes are intended only for use in
   documents providing examples involving specification of some subtype
   of the given media type, where the actual subtype used is irrelevant.

5.  Security Considerations

   The 'example' media type and subtypes are defined for use in
   documentation only.  They MUST NOT be implemented.  Any attempt to
   implement them in real code could lead to unpredictable results and
   thus potentially open up security holes.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies and registers the 'example' media type and
   the 'application/example', 'audio/example', 'image/example',
   'message/example', 'model/example', 'multipart/example',
   'text/example', and 'video/example' subtypes.

7.  Acknowledgements

   This document sprang from Magnus Westerland's expression of need and
   Rod Walsh's support and suggestions for generalization.  Warnings
   against implementation in the Security Considerations and
   Interoperability Considerations sections and the 'multipart/example'
   subtype were added at John Klensin's suggestion.  Some editing
   touchups and strengthening of the language in the Security
   Considerations section were done in response to the Gen-ART reviewer,
   Sharon Chisholm.
