Abstract

   This document reports the results of the BGP-4 implementation survey.
   The survey had 259 questions about implementations' support of BGP-4
   as specified in RFC 4271.  After a brief summary of the results, each
   response is listed.  This document contains responses from the four
   implementers that completed the survey (Alcatel, Cisco, Laurel, and
   NextHop) and brief information from three that did not (Avici, Data
   Connection Ltd., and Nokia).

   The editors did not use exterior means to verify the accuracy of the
   information submitted by the respondents.  The respondents are
   experts with the products they reported on.

1.  Introduction

   This document reports results from a survey of implementations of
   BGP-4 as specified in [RFC4271].  RFC 4271 is in alignment with
   current deployments of BGP-4 and obsoletes the BGP standard
   [RFC1771].  BGP is a widely deployed cornerstone of Internet
   technology that continues to add additional functionality as the
   needs of the Internet evolve.  As deployed in the Internet, BGP-4
   encompasses both this base specification and additional
   specifications such as TCP MD5 [RFC2385], BGP Route Reflectors
   [RFC2796], BGP Confederations [RFC3065], and BGP Route Refresh
   [RFC2918].

   The BGP-4 implementation survey had 259 detailed questions about
   compliance with [RFC4271].  Four implementers (Alcatel, Cisco,
   Laurel, and NextHop) completed the survey.  Section 3 provides a
   compilation of those results.

   Section 2.1 highlights significant differences and Section 2.2
   provides an overview of the differences between the four
   implementations.  Section 2.3 provides interoperability information.

   Due to the large number of BGP implementations and the small number
   of respondents, the editors took an informal survey to determine if
   the length of the original survey caused implementers not to submit
   it.  Three implementers responded, and all indicated the length of
   the survey was the issue.  Section 4 gives the results of this
   informal survey.

   In this document, the editors have compiled the results of the
   implementation survey results and the informal survey.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Results of Survey

   The respondents replied "Y" (yes) or "N" (no) to the survey's 259
   questions to indicate whether their implementation supports the
   Functionality/Description of the [RFC2119] language in [RFC4271].
   The respondents replied "O" (other) to indicate that the support is
   neither "Y" nor "N" (for example, an alternate behavior).

2.1.  Significant Differences

   Each question received affirmative responses from at least two
   implementers (i.e., two "Y" responses, or one "Y" and one "O"),
   except the following questions:

   a) MUST - Linked Questions 212/213, regarding Section 9.1.4

      Due to the format of the linked questions, three vendors (Cisco,
      Laurel, and NextHop) replied "N" to Question 213.  (See Section
      2.2 for details.)

   b) SHALL NOT - Question 228, regarding Section 9.2.2.2

      Three vendors (Alcatel, Cisco, and Laurel) answered "N" to SHALL
      NOT (meaning they did).  One vendor (NextHop) indicated "O"
      matching the specification.

      Text:  Routes that have different MULTI_EXIT_DISC attribute SHALL
             NOT be aggregated.  (Section 9.2.2.2, [RFC4271])

   c) SHOULD - Questions 257 and 258, regarding Appendix F

      Three vendors answered "N" and one vendor answered "Y" to Question
      257.  All four vendors answered "N" to Question 258.  (Please note
      that support of Appendix F, "Implementation Recommendations", is
      optional.)

RFC 4276              BGP-4 Implementation Report           January 2006


      Text:  A BGP speaker which needs to withdraw a destination and
             send an update about a more specific or less specific route
             SHOULD combine them into the same UPDATE message.
             (Appendix F.2, [RFC4271])

      Text:  The last instance (rightmost occurrence) of that AS number
             is kept.  (Appendix F.6, [RFC4271])

   d) MAY - Questions 180 and 254, regarding Sections 8.1.2.4 and 10

      Three vendors answered "N", and 1 replied "Y" to Question 180.

      Text:  The Event numbers (1-28) utilized in this state machine
             description aid in specifying the behavior of the BGP state
             machine.  Implementations MAY use these numbers to provide
             network management information.  The exact form of a FSM or
             the FSM events are specific to each implementation.
             (Section 8.1.2.4, [RFC4271])

      Editors' note:  Section 8.1.2.4 was written to allow existing
                      implementations to transition to the new event
                      numbering.  It was expected over time (3 years)
                      that the FSM event numbering would be updated to
                      the new numbering.

      Three vendors answered "N" and one answered "Y" to Question 254
      about configurable jitter time values.

      Text:  A given BGP speaker MAY apply the same jitter to each of
             these quantities regardless of the destinations to which
             the updates are being sent; that is, jitter need not be
             configured on a "per peer" basis.  (Section 10, [RFC4271])

      Question:  Is the jitter range configurable?

2.2.  Overview of Differences

   This section provides the reader with a shortcut to the points where
   the four implementations differ.

   The following questions were not answered "Y" by all four respondents
   (Note that the question numbers correspond to the final digit of
   subsection numbers of Section 3):

      MUST
      97, 106, 107, 111, 122, 125, 138, 141, 213

      Other
      236, 238

      Linked Questions
      212/213

      Three vendors answered "N" and one answered "Y" to Question 213
      about the aggregation of routes.  Questions 212 and 213 are
      grouped together.

      Question 212 states: "The decision process MUST either install
         both routes or..."

      Question 213 states:  "Aggregate the two routes and install the
         aggregated route, provided that both routes have the same value
         of the NEXT_HOP attribute"

      Of the four respondents that said "Y" to Question 212, three said
      "N" to Question 213.  Given the context of the question, answering
      "N" to Question 213 is appropriate.

3.  BGP-4 Implementation Report

   For every item listed, the respondents indicated whether their
   implementation supports the Functionality/Description or not (Y/N)
   according to the [RFC2119] language indicated.  Any respondent
   comments are included.  If appropriate, the respondents indicated
   with "O" the fact that the support is neither Y/N (an alternate
   behavior, for example).  Refer to the appropriate sections in
   [RFC4271] for additional details.  Note that the last digit of the
   subsection number is the number of the survey question.

4.  Additional BGP Implementations Information

   Three implementations responded to a call (5/20/04-6/2/04) for
   information on those implementations that had a BGP implementation,
   but did not complete the full survey.  The responses for the call for
   additional information are below.

4.1.  Avici

   If you have an implementation of BGP and you did not send in an
   implementation report (answering the 259 questions), could you send
   me the answer the following questions:

             Current deployed versions are 5.x and 6.0.x.
             Version 6.1 and beyond are tested against the
             latest BGP specification [RFC4271].

   2) What other implementations you interoperate with.

         Cisco: IOS 12.0(22)
         Juniper: JUNOS (version not given)

      4) NextHop GateD - not tested

   4) Did the length of the survey for BGP cause you to not
      submit the BGP implementation report?

      yes
