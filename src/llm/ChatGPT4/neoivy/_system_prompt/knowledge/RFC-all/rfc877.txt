          A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams
                               Over
                       Public Data Networks




This RFC specifies a standard adopted by CSNET, the VAN gateway, and
other organizations for the transmission of IP datagrams over the
X.25-based public data networks. 

An X.25 virtual circuit is opened on demand when a datagram arrives at
the network interface for transmission. A virtual circuit is closed
after some period of inactivity (the length of the period depends on
the cost associated with an open virtual circuit). A virtual circuit
may also be closed if the interface runs out of virtual circuits. An
algorithm for managing virtual circuits during peak demand is given
in [1].

STANDARDS

1.1 The first octet in the Call User Data Field (the first data octet
    in the Call Request packet) is used for protocol demultiplexing.
    The value hex CC (binary 11001100, decimal 204) is used to mean
    INTERNET PROTOCOL. 

1.2 IP datagrams are sent as X.25 "complete packet sequences". That is,
    datagrams begin on packet boundaries and the M bit ("more data") is
    used for datagrams that are larger than one packet. There are no
    additional headers or other data in the packets.

1.3 Unless a larger packet size is negotiated, the maximum size of an
    IP datagram transmitted over X.25 is 576 octets. If two sites
    negotiate a large X.25 packet size (for example, 1024 octets), an
    IP datagram of that size is allowed. 

1.4 Either site may close a virtual circuit. If the virtual circuit is
    closed or reset while a datagram is being transmitted, the datagram
    is lost.

GENERAL REMARKS

2.1 Protocols above IP, such as TCP, do not affect this standard. In
    particular, no attempt is made to open X.25 virtual circuits
    corresponding to TCP connections.

Transmission of IP Datagrams Over Public Data Networks


2.2 Features of X.25 not discussed in this document are not used.
    For example, interrupt packets and the D bit (indicating
    end-to-end significance) are not used.

2.3 Negotiable features (facilities) of X.25 are allowed. For
    example, sites are free to negotiate larger packet and window
    sizes.

2.4 Some sites, such as CSNET sites, may attempt to open multiple
    virtual circuits to a single site. Sites should attempt to
    handle such incoming calls gracefully: transmit on the
    additional circuits if possible and accept incoming datagrams
    from them, but do not accept the CALL REQUEST, only to
    immediately close the connection or ignore datagrams
    transmitted on such circuits.
