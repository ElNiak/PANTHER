                       Socket Number List


The czar of socket numbers [Jon Postel] has established the
following assignments for socket numbers used for public
functions. Note that a socket number is a 40 bit quantity, the
first 8 bits being the host specification, the next 24 bits being
site specific, and the last 8 bits being user specified - these
last 8 bits are called the AEN [it stands for, cleverly enough,
Another Eightbit Number].

For the assignments here the value in the host field ranges
across all hosts (unless otherwise specified), the value in the
24 bit field is zero, and the AEN is indicated here.

General Assignments:

       Sockets         Assignment

       0 - 63          Network Wide Standard Functions
       64 - 127        Host Specific Functions
       128 - 239       Reserved for Future Use
       240 - 255       Any Experimental Function


Particular Assignments:

       Socket          Assignment

       1               Telnet
       3               File Transfer
       5               Remote Job Entry
       7               Echo
       9               Discard
       19              Character Generator [e.g. TTYTST]

       65              Speech Data Base @ ll-tx-2 (74)
       67              Datacomputer @ cca (31)

It has come to our attention that there are several hosts
performing useful public services on sockets which conflict with
the above scheme. We hope we can resolve this problem with a
minimum of disruption.

The following is a tabulation of socket numbers together with the
services offered. This listing is presented as an aid to network
users. If you know of a socket/function which has been left out
or an entry which should be corrected or deleted please contact:
