1.  Introduction

   This document describes the conventions for using several
   cryptographic algorithms with the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
   key package receipt and error content types [RFC7191].  Specifically,
   it includes conventions necessary to implement SignedData [RFC5652],
   EnvelopedData [RFC5652], EncryptedData [RFC5652], and
   AuthEnvelopedData [RFC5083].

   This document does not define any new algorithms; instead, it refers
   to previously defined algorithms.  In fact, the algorithm
   requirements in this document are the same as those in [RFC5959],
   [RFC6033], [RFC6160], [RFC6161], and [RFC6162] with the following
   exceptions: the content-encryption algorithm is AES in Cipher Block
   Chaining (CBC) mode as opposed to AES Key Wrap with Message Length
   Indicator (MLI) and the key-wrap algorithm is AES Key Wrap as opposed
   to AES Key Wrap with MLI.  The rationale for the difference is that
   the receipt and error content types are not keys; therefore, AES Key
   Wrap with MLI is not appropriate for the content-encryption
   algorithm.  If an implementation is not using AES Key Wrap with MLI
   as the content-encryption algorithm, then there's no need to keep the
   key-wrap algorithm the same as the content encryption algorithm.

   NOTE: [RFC7191] only requires that the key package receipt be signed.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  SignedData

   If an implementation supports SignedData, then it MUST support the
   signature scheme RSA [RFC3370] and SHOULD support the signature
   schemes RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS) [RFC4056] and
   Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) [RFC3370].  Additionally,
   implementations MUST support the hash function SHA-256 [RFC5754] in
   concert with these signature schemes, and they SHOULD support the
   hash function SHA-1 [RFC3370].  Implementations can also choose the
   to support Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
   [RFC5753] and [RFC6090].

3.  EnvelopedData

   If an implementation supports EnvelopedData, then it MUST implement
   key transport and it MAY implement key agreement.

   When key transport is used, RSA encryption [RFC3370] MUST be
   supported, and RSA Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption
   Padding (RSAES-OAEP) [RFC3560] SHOULD be supported.

   When key agreement is used, Diffie-Hellman (DH) ephemeral-static
   [RFC3370] MUST be supported.  When key agreement is used, Elliptic
   Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) [RFC5753] [RFC6090] MAY be supported.

   Regardless of the key management technique choice, implementations
   MUST support AES-128 in CBC mode [AES] as the content-encryption
   algorithm.  Implementations SHOULD support AES-256 in CBC mode [AES]
   as the content-encryption algorithm.

   When key agreement is used, the same length for the underlying block
   algorithm MUST be used.  If the content-encryption algorithm is
   AES-128 in CBC mode, then the key-wrap algorithm MUST be AES-128 Key
   Wrap [RFC3394].  If the content-encryption algorithm is AES-256 in
   CBC mode, then the key-wrap algorithm MUST be AES-256 Key Wrap
   [RFC3394].

4.  EncryptedData

   If an implementation supports EncryptedData, then it MUST implement
   AES-128 in CBC mode [AES] and SHOULD implement AES-256 in CBC mode
   [AES].

   NOTE: EncryptedData requires that keys be managed by other means;
   therefore, the only algorithm specified is the content-encryption
   algorithm.

5.  AuthEnvelopedData

   If an implementation supports AuthEnvelopedData, then it MUST
   implement the EnvelopedData recommendations except for the content-
   encryption algorithm, which, in this case, MUST be AES-GCM [RFC5084];
   the 128-bit version MUST be implemented, and the 256-bit version
   SHOULD be implemented.  Implementations MAY also support AES-CCM
   [RFC5084].

6.  Public Key Sizes

   The easiest way to implement SignedData, EnvelopedData, and
   AuthEnvelopedData is with public key certificates [RFC5280].  If an
   implementation supports RSA, RSASSA-PSS, DSA, RSAES-OAEP, or Diffie-
   Hellman, then it MUST support key lengths from 1024-bit to 2048-bit,
   inclusive.  If an implementation supports ECDSA or ECDH, then it MUST
   support keys on the P-256 curve [RFC6090].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations from [RFC3370], [RFC3394], [RFC3560],
   [RFC4056], [RFC5084], [RFC5652], [RFC5753], and [RFC5754] apply.

   [SP800-57] provides comparable bits of security for some algorithms
   and key sizes.  [SP800-57] also provides time frames during which
   certain numbers of bits of security are appropriate, and some
   environments may find these time frames useful.
