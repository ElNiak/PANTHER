Abstract

   Prior to the publication of RFC 2489 (which was updated by RFC 2939),
   several option codes were assigned to proposed Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol (DHCP) options that were subsequently never
   used.  This document lists those unused option codes and directs IANA
   to make these option codes available for assignment to other DHCP
   options in the future.

   The document also lists several option codes that are not currently
   documented in an RFC but should not be made available for
   reassignment to future DHCP options.

1. Introduction

   Section 2 of this document lists the unused DHCP option codes from
   the IANA list of BOOTP and DHCP option codes [1].  Each option code
   includes any known documentation and contact information from the
   IANA list.  IANA will make these option codes available for
   assignment to other DHCP options in the future.

   Section 3 lists several DHCP option codes that are not currently
   documented in an RFC but should not be made available for
   reassignment to future DHCP options.

2. Unused DHCP Option Codes to be Reassigned to Future DHCP Options

   The option codes listed in this section are to be returned to IANA
   for reassignment to new options.  Responses from associated contact
   persons are noted where they have been received.

3. Option codes to be reserved by IANA

   The option codes listed in this section are the subject of ongoing
   work in the DHC Working Group (WG).  These option codes should remain
   on the IANA list of assigned option codes [1] until the DHC WG has
   made a final decision about their disposition.

3.1. Option codes used in PXE Specification

   The following option codes are used in the "Preboot Execution
   Environment (PXE) Specification, Version 2.1" [4].  However, although
   these options are in widespread use by devices that use PXE, none of
   these option codes have been described in a published RFC.

   The DHC WG will endeavor to have specifications for these options
   published.

3.3. Option Code Extensions

   Note that these option codes are identified in "Extending DHCP
   Options Codes" [5] as part of a mechanism for extending the set of
   option codes available to DHCP.  If these option codes are not used
   for DHCP option code extension, they will be returned to IANA for
   reassignment to other DHCP options.

   Codes:             126, 127
   Name:              Option Code Extensions
   Defined in:        (expired Internet-Draft)
   Contact:           Ralph Droms

4. Already Returned for Reassignment

   The option codes 99, 102-107, 109 and 111 have already been returned
   for reassignment to future DHCP options.

5. Security Considerations

   This document has no known security implications, as none of the
   reclaimed options are known to be in use.

6. IANA Considerations

   IANA has returned the DHCP option codes listed in Section 2 to the
   list of available option codes.  These option codes may be reassigned
   to new DHCP options, according to the procedures in RFC 2939 [6].
   IANA is requested to reassign these option codes after the list of
   option codes that have never been assigned or have previously been
   returned has been exhausted.
