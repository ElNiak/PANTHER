Abstract

   This document provides a guideline for creating civic address
   considerations documents for individual countries, as required by RFC
   4776.  Furthermore, this document also creates an IANA Registry
   referring to such address considerations documents and registers such
   address considerations for Austria.

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


1.  Introduction

   The Presence Information Data Format Location Object (PIDF-LO)
   [RFC4119] is an object format for carrying geographical information
   on the Internet.  PIDF-LO can contain civic address information and
   supports a range of "civic address types" (CAtypes) to hold the
   individual attributes of such addresses (see Section 2.2.1 of
   [RFC4119] and Section 3.1 of [RFC5139]).

   In many use cases, PIDF-LOs are populated with data from long-
   established sources, like postal and governmental building registers,
   line information databases and yellow/white pages of infrastructure
   providers, or official residents registers.  The structure and format
   of data from such sources is almost always different from PIDF-LO's
   CAtypes definition -- additionally, the structure and format of those
   sources differ from country to country.

   To make use of such existing data sources, transposing that data into
   PIDF-LO format is required.  With no guidelines available on how to
   map source Fields into CAtype Elements, different creators of PIDF-LO
   documents might end up with different results, even when using the
   same data source, which reduces interoperability and increases the
   risk of misinterpretation by recipients.

   Therefore, civic address considerations are necessary to ensure
   uniform usage of PIDF-LO Elements for such data sources.  [RFC4776]
   explicitly requests such documents to be provided, but defines
   neither their structure nor a way to publish them.  This memo
   provides documentation on how to create such civic address
   considerations, and IANA has created a registry to store references
   to such documents.  Furthermore, civic address considerations for
   Austria are provided in Appendix A and have been registered in the
   IANA registry.

   Section 3.4 of [RFC4776] contains some example considerations
   regarding the use of administrative subdivision Elements for Canada,
   Germany, Japan, Korea, and the United States.  This document
   registers these examples with IANA as "obsolete" (see Section 6.3).

   Section 3.4 of [RFC4776] also contains instructions on the creation
   of civic address considerations documents on page 8.  This document
   updates that section and replaces said instructions with Sections 4
   and 5 of this memo.

   The guidelines in this document have been created with a focus on
   formal application of PIDF-LO (such as conveying location during an
   emergency call).  It is not intended to forbid other, more informal
   uses of PIDF-LO that may not follow any formal mapping



Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                 [Page 3]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   specifications.  An example use case of such informal usage may be
   the transmission of PIDF-LO documents during an instant-messaging
   session between humans.  Such use may, however, imply some drawbacks,
   like prohibiting automatic processing of civic addresses from such a
   PIDF-LO.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   In addition, this document uses "Field" to refer to a field of a
   civic address data source, and "Element" to refer to a CAtype Element
   of a PIDF-LO.

3.  Requirements

   The following requirements apply to defining civic-address mapping
   considerations:

   o  The considerations document MUST identify the data source to which
      the definitions apply.  A brief description of its structure
      SHOULD be provided as well.

   o  For any data source, just one active mapping definition should
      exist in order to reduce the risk of ambiguous interpretation.

   o  The document MUST include instructions for any Field that occurs
      in the data.  For any of the Fields, the document MUST describe
      whether the Field is required, optional, or must not be used in
      the mapping procedure.

   o  Instructions MUST be included for any CAtype Element that is
      registered by the time the document is created.  Those
      instructions MUST include information regarding whether an Element
      is required, optional, or must not be used in that mapping.  In
      case the set of CAtypes is revised by the IETF, the address
      considerations document SHOULD be updated.  Until an update is
      approved, the existing mapping procedure MUST be used.

   o  Address mapping procedures SHOULD be reversible so that location
      recipients can identify the corresponding record in the original
      data source (given they have access to that source).

   o  For any source data Field that is required or optional, at least
      one example mapping MUST be provided.




Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                 [Page 4]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   o  In many cases, data sources used in the mapping process might be
      subject to access restrictions.  Such restrictions (as imposed on
      the original data) MUST also be imposed on the resulting PIDF-LO
      documents.  The considerations document SHOULD note such
      restrictions in its Security Considerations section.

   Although the mapping is defined in a national way and the actual
   meaning of several PIDF-LO Elements may not be clear to an outsider,
   at least the country Element tells in what context this PIDF-LO was
   created.  In case of emergency calls, a PIDF-LO would just be passed
   to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) in the same country as the
   location generator anyway.  However, in a border region there might
   be exceptions and the PIDF-LO could be sent to a neighboring country.
   The PIDF-LO can still be passed on to a PSAP in the right country
   (based on the country Element), or the PSAP might be aware of the
   mapping scheme used in the neighboring country.

   A consistent mapping is also very important for checking if two PIDF-
   LO documents describe the same location.  When civic address Fields
   are put into different PIDF-LO Elements, it may be difficult to
   identify whether or not two PIDF-LOs describe identical addresses.

4.  Specifying PIDF-LO Element Usage

   The purpose of the civic address considerations for an individual
   data source is to create interoperability by specifying a common list
   of PIDF-LO Elements to be used and by defining the mapping between
   these Elements and the Fields of the respective data source.

4.1.  General Considerations and Workflow

   The workflow for creating an address considerations document is as
   follows:

   1.  Describe the data source to which the address considerations
       document applies.

   2.  Identify all Fields from the data source and decide, for each of
       the Fields, whether or not it is to be used for the purpose of
       creating PIDF-LO documents.  The considerations document must
       list all Fields (or at least state which Fields are considered in
       the mapping and clearly state that the other Fields MUST NOT be
       used).

   3.  For each of the Fields that are required or optional, specify a
       clear mapping instruction according to the guidelines below.





Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                 [Page 5]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   4.  Provide a list of all CAtypes registered and describe their level
       of usage in this mapping (or combine it with the list of Fields
       above and clearly list which Elements are not used for the
       mapping procedure).  For Elements that are not described in
       detail, state whether they MUST NOT be used at all or whether
       they may be used without further restriction.

   5.  Provide examples of source data and mapping results.

   Civic address Elements are designed to be generic containers.  In
   some cases, Fields clearly correspond to such a container; however,
   in some other cases, identifying the correct container might require
   some approximation.  For example, in some countries the RD (road)
   Element might also be appropriate for other thoroughfares, like
   waterways or tunnels.

   Fields that are identified to have the same meaning as one of the
   CAtypes SHOULD be directly mapped to that CAtype Element.

   Where CAtype usage diverges from the original specification, the
   mapping definition of Fields that are mapped to that Element SHOULD
   include a discussion of the differences.

   Fields that do not fit into an existing CAtype:

      Even though the list of CAtypes could be extended, it is not
      feasible to add new Elements for every new Field in every data
      source in every country.  Therefore, unless new generic CAtypes
      are specified by the IETF, only existing Elements can be used,
      which leaves the following options:

      1.  Concatenate several civic address Fields into a single PIDF-LO
          Element (define delimiters if applicable and make sure the
          separate civic address parts can be retrieved again).

      2.  Use a PIDF-LO Element that is unused so far.

      Note: Obviously, the first option is required if the number of
      Fields that are used in the mapping procedure is greater than the
      number of existing CAtype Elements.

   Note that the xml:lang attribute should be present in PIDF-LO XML
   [W3C.REC-xml-20060816] documents, according to RFC 5139.

4.2.  Guidelines for Individual Elements

   The following sections discuss individual PIDF-LO Elements and
   describe what to consider for each Element when defining civic
   address considerations.  It is RECOMMENDED to follow a similar
   structure for considerations documents.

4.2.1.  Country

   The country Element must hold the alpha-2 codes from ISO 3166-1
   [ISO3166-1] in uppercase characters, as clarified in Section 3.3 of
   RFC 5139 [RFC5139].

   This Element cannot be redefined on a national basis since it
   identifies the country itself.  This Element is used to identify
   which national mapping for civic addresses has been used in a
   specific PIDF-LO.

   Example for Austria: <country>AT</country>

4.2.2.  Country Subdivisions A1-A6

   The Elements A1 to A6 are used to hold national subdivision
   identifiers, with A1 holding the top-level subdivision identifier.
   A1 may either contain the second part of ISO 3166-2 [ISO3166-2] (see
   Section 3.4 of RFC 5139 [RFC5139]) or other values as described in
   the particular address considerations document.  Elements "A2" to
   "A6" may contain additional levels of subdivisions (see Section 2.2.1
   of RFC 4119).

   For A1, an address considerations document MUST state whether ISO
   3166-2 codes are to be used exclusively; alternatively, it should
   define a list of values to be used (for example, subdivision names).
   In either case, A1 MUST NOT be redefined for any other use than
   describing top-level subdivisions.

   For each of the A2 - A6 Elements that are required or optional, the
   document SHOULD define the set of allowed values, either by listing
   them or by referring to such a list.

   Example for Austria:

   A1 province (Bundesland)
   A2 political district (politischer Bezirk) name or identifier
   A3 commune (Gemeinde) name or identifier
   A4 village (Ortschaft) name or identifier
   A5 cadastral municipality (Katastralgemeinde) name or identifier




Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                 [Page 7]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   A6 must not be used.  For more details, see the example in Appendix
   A.4.2.

4.2.3.  Road and Street Names

   PIDF-LO contains the following Elements related to road names: RD,
   RDSEC, RDBR, RDSUBADDR, PRM, POM (Sections 3.1 and 3.2 of RFC 5139
   [RFC5139]) and PRD, POD, STS (Sections 3.4 of [RFC4776]).  Note: the
   use of the A6 Element for street names is not valid any more (Section
   3.2 of RFC 5139 [RFC5139]).

   Besides the basic specification of which of those Elements are
   required, optional, or not to be used, an address considerations
   document may also describe more complicated dependencies (for
   example, "RD is optional, but required if any other road name Element
   is used").

   For any required or optional Element, the relation of those Elements
   to Fields of the data source used MUST be described, as should
   special considerations (like concatenation of Fields into an
   Element), if they apply.  The usage of the Element STS (street
   suffix) SHOULD be consistent.  In case no suffixes are known in a
   data source, or it is common to write the street name and the suffix
   together, the STS Element SHOULD be left out completely.  If suffixes
   may be abbreviated, the common abbreviations SHOULD be defined.

   Example for Austria:

   RD: street name

   All other road Elements must not be used.  Street suffixes are
   already included in the "street name" Field and must not be
   abbreviated.

4.2.4.  House Numbers

   PIDF-LO specifies two Elements related to house numbers: HNO ("house
   number", numeric part only) and HNS ("house number suffix") (see
   Section 3.4 of RFC 4776).  However, in many countries house numbers
   have a more complex format.  In any case, a clear definition is
   REQUIRED to minimize the potential for confusion.

   An address considerations document should provide the following
   information with regards to house numbers: if the structure of house
   numbers fits the HNO/HNS structure, the document MUST mandate to use
   those Elements as described in RFC 4776.  If the structure of house
   numbers does not directly fit into those two Elements, the document




Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                 [Page 8]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   MUST define strategies on how to map source Fields into Elements.
   Besides HNO and HNS, LOC and BLD could be considered for carrying
   house number information.

   The document SHOULD describe whether or not abbreviations of house
   number information is valid.  If abbreviations are used, they MUST be
   clearly defined.  If house numbers consist of more than one number,
   or if multiple prefixes and suffixes may coexist, a delimiter symbol
   and a clear rule on how to concatenate all this data into the HNO and
   HNS Element might be necessary.  Whenever concatenating data into one
   Element, keep in mind that the location recipient might want to
   separate the data again.

   Example from Austria:

   HNO: concatenate all the data Fields of Austrian house numbers into
        this single PIDF-LO Element in a defined order with delimiter
        symbols (see Appendix A.4.4 for the complete definition).

   HNS: usage not allowed since there may be multiple suffixes for the
        different parts of the house number.

   LOC and BLD are not to be used to reflect house number information.

4.2.5.  Local Names

   PIDF-LO contains three Elements to reflect local names: LMK, LOC, and
   NAM (Section 3.4 of RFC 4776).  Such local names may be of importance
   for the identification of a location and may either coexist with a
   valid civic address or (in some cases) have no address assigned, in
   which case the local name, itself, identifies the location.  In rural
   regions, for example, a farm name may be more common than a street
   address to identify a location.  Landmarks typically don't have any
   civic address information assigned.  Therefore, local names may
   assist in finding a "street name" type address, but they might also
   be the authoritative (and only) civic location information.

   For any required or optional Element out of LMK, LOC, or NAM, the
   considerations document should state potential values (source data)
   for the Element.  In the case that multiple values for an Element may
   occur, a concatenation/selection strategy should be described.
   Concatenation using ";" as a separator is recommended, unless this
   character also appears in the source Fields.

   If local name information and "common" address information is both
   available and used, the document SHOULD discuss the relationship
   between those two address information types and the expected behavior
   of location recipients.



Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                 [Page 9]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   Example from Austria:

   NAM: contains the "Vulgoname" (local name); multiple local names are
        separated by a semicolon (if applicable).

   LMK: contains the farm name (just one name possible) (if applicable).

   LOC: can be used without restriction for additional location
        information (as per RFC 4119).

   The "Vulgoname" is useful to identify the location within its
   locality, since official addresses (especially in rural regions)
   might not be well known.

4.2.6.  Floors

   PIDF-LO defines the Element FLR to hold floor information but does
   not further specify its content.  Section 2.1 of RFC 3825 provides
   guidance about floor numbering but is not directly related to PIDF-
   LO.

   An address considerations document SHOULD clearly specify how to
   express floors using the FLR Element.  Following the above-mentioned
   guidance is RECOMMENDED; however, local nomenclature might require a
   completely different system.  The document SHOULD specify whether
   only numbers, text, or both are allowed in the FLR Element.  If there
   are standard values for certain floors, they SHOULD be listed.
   Abbreviations SHOULD be avoided, unless they are the primary (well-
   known) way of identifying floors.

   Example from Austria:

   If floor numbers are to be mapped, the FLR Element MUST be used.
   Numbers and text are both allowed.  The first floor (<FLR>1</FLR>) is
   the first "full" floor above the floor at street level.  The floor at
   street level is <FLR>EG</FLR> or <FLR>0</FLR>.  There might be
   intermediate floors, especially between the floor at street level and
   the "first floor".  Such intermediate floors have names like
   "Mezzanine", "Erster Halbstock" ("first half floor"), or "Zweiter
   Halbstock" ("second half floor"), and have local meanings.

4.2.7.  Address Codes

   Address codes are available in several countries in different forms
   (for estates, buildings, or usable units for example).  These codes
   identify an address record and MAY be placed in the ADDCODE Element
   in PIDF-LO.  Address codes can help the location recipient to
   determine the location and to identify the original record in the



Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                [Page 10]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   data source.  Depending on the type of code, the code alone (without
   any other Elements) may even be sufficient to fully identify an
   address within a country.

   In such cases, a PIDF-LO containing just the country and ADDCODE
   Elements might provide enough information to retrieve a civic
   address, given the location recipient has access to the respective
   source database.

   A civic address considerations document SHOULD specify whether and in
   which applications the use of the ADDCODE Element is allowed.  If
   ADDCODE is used, its relation to the remaining Elements MUST be
   clearly stated.  If several namespaces for address codes exist in a
   country, a mechanism to distinguish the different code spaces MUST be
   described.

   Examples from Austria:

   Statistik Austria provides 4 codes: Adresscode (AdrCD), Adresssubcode
   (AdrsubCD), Objektnummer (ObjNr), and Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer
   (NtzLnr).

   The following format SHOULD be used:

        <ADDCODE>AdrCD=1234567;AdrsubCD=123;
        ObjNr=2333211;NtzLnr=0001</ADDCODE>

4.2.8.  Other Elements

   This section lists all PIDF-LO Elements that have not been discussed
   so far.

   To specify the location inside a building, the following Elements can
   be useful:

   o  UNIT
   o  ROOM
   o  SEAT

   The following Elements are to be used for the representation of
   postal codes:

   o  PC
   o  PCN
   o  POBOX

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   To describe the place-type or the building, the following Elements
   are available:

   o  PLC - Place-type (for allowed values, refer to the IANA registry
      defined in [RFC4589])

   o  BLD - Building (structure)

   For any of those Elements that are required or optional in a mapping,
   the semantics of its contents must be described if it differs from
   the definition in the PIDF-LO base documents.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the Elements SEAT, UNIT, and ROOM remain to be
   used for identifying a location inside a building.  They MAY be used
   by the owner of the respective building if a considerations document
   does not restrict their use.  For example, an airport could decide to
   place the gate number in the UNIT Element and a location recipient
   could identify that PIDF-LO by the value of the PLC Element.  The
   name of the airport could be placed in NAM.

5.  Security Considerations

   RFC 4119 contains general security considerations for handling PIDF-
   LOs.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the registry "PIDF-LO Civic Address Considerations
   Registry", according to the following definitions.  Furthermore, this
   document registers a civic address considerations document for
   Austrian addresses, as provided in the Appendix of this document, and
   also registers the considerations of RFC 4776 as obsolete.

6.1.  PIDF-LO Civic Address Considerations Registry

6.1.1.  Structure

   The IANA registry contains the following fields:

   o  Country-Code: either the ISO 3166 alpha-two code of the country to
      which the consideration applies or "other" in case the
      considerations document is not specific to a particular country.
      This field is to be defined by the requestor.

   o  Serial Number: a number that uniquely identifies a considerations
      document within a certain "Country-Code" field value.  Serial
      Numbers are sequentially assigned by IANA per Country-Code value,
      start at zero, and are never reused.

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   o  Reference to specification: this field contains a reference to the
      considerations document.  The xref type "rfc" should be used for
      referencing to RFCs, while other documents should use the "uri"
      type.

   o  Requestor: the author of the document.

   o  Status: one of either "active" or "obsolete".  When the document
      is registered by IANA, the status is first set to "active" by
      IANA.  Experts may later request changing the status to
      "obsolete", especially if there is an updated version of the
      considerations document available.  Authors of considerations
      documents must contact the experts if they wish to change the
      status of the document.

   Note: the combination of Country-Code and Serial Number fields
   uniquely identifies a considerations document in the registry (for
   example, "AT-0", "US-0", "US-1", or "other-0").

6.1.2.  Registration Template

   For registration of address considerations documents in the registry,
   requesters SHOULD use the following template.  The template SHOULD be
   contained in the considerations document itself.

           <record>
             <country> <!-- Country-Code --> </country>
             <serial> <!-- assigned by IANA --> </serial>

             <!-- reference to document -->
             <xref type="uri" data="http://www.example.org/civicaddr/"/>

             <!-- record requesters -->
             <xref type="person" data="John_Doe"/>
             <xref type="person" data="Jane_Dale"/>

             <status> <!-- assigned by IANA --> </status>
           </record>

          <people>

              <uri> <!-- mailto: or http: URI --> </uri>
              <updated> <!-- date format YYYY-MM-DD --> </updated>
            </person>
            <!-- repeat person section for each person -->
          </people>

6.1.3.  Registry Location

   Approved registrations are published in the IANA registry named
   "PIDF-LO Civic Address Considerations Registry", which is available
   from http://www.iana.org.

   Registrations are sorted by ascending order by the Country-Code and
   by Serial Number within Country-Code values.  Registrations with
   Country-Code of "other" are put at the end of the list.

6.1.4.  Registration Procedure

   Following the policies outlined in [RFC5226], new address
   considerations are added to the registry after Expert Review (see
   Section 4.1 in RFC 5226).  The Expert will generally check if the
   submitted address considerations conform to the civic address
   guidelines in this document (see Section 4).  If in doubt, the Expert
   SHOULD consult the GEOPRIV mailing list or its dedicated successor.
   If possible, the Experts SHOULD check the available documentation on
   which the address consideration is based.

6.2.  Registration Request for Austria

   This document registers the civic address considerations for
   addresses from the official Austrian Building and Habitation
   registry, according to the registration procedure described above.
   The required information is contained in Appendix A.

6.3.  Registration of the Considerations in RFC 4776 as Obsolete

   Since this document updates RFC 4776, the considerations on the
   subdivision Elements in Section 3.4 of RFC 4776 for Canada, Germany,
   Japan, Korea, and the United States are obsolete.  The following IANA
   registration records register them in the IANA registry as obsolete.

Appendix A.  Civic Address Considerations Registration for the Austrian
             Building and Habitation Registry

   The Austrian "Gebaeude- und Wohnungsregistergesetz" (building and
   habitation registry law) is the legal basis for the obligation to
   provide a registry of civic addresses, buildings, and their usable
   units (subdivisions of buildings).  The registry is operated by
   "Statistik Austria GmbH", a fully governmentally owned company.  The
   local administrations of individual townships are responsible for
   keeping records in the registry up to date.

   The data format definition for the individual records is publicly
   available (data access itself is, however, restricted).  Hence, a
   uniform address database for the whole of Austria is available.  A
   detailed description of the Statistik Austria civic address data
   format is contained in Appendix A.1.

A.1.  Civic Address Format in Austria

   Statistik Austria data describes estates, buildings, and usable units
   [merkmalskatalog].  On a single estate there may be any number of
   buildings.  Apartment houses that have more than one staircase are
   split up in separate buildings at every staircase.  In every
   building, there may be several usable units.  For example, an
   apartment house may have several apartments, counting as separate
   usable units.  Moreover, one building may have more than one address
   but will have at least one address.  Below, the address Fields for
   estates (Table 1), buildings (Table 2), and usable units (Table 3)
   are shown.

   The ADDCODE, A5, and PCN Elements are optional, and the other
   Elements MUST be used if the data source contains their corresponding
   Fields.  The Elements A1 and A2 (not listed in the tables) SHOULD
   also be used if data is available.  Exception: when using the address
   codes only (access to the codes is necessary for the creator and
   recipient of the location information), just the ADDCODE and country
   Elements are mandatory; the other Elements can be used optionally, of
   course.

         Table 3: Additional Civic Address Fields for Usable Units

   Note: "floors" in Austria (as in most parts of Europe) are counted
   differently compared to the US.  The "1st floor" in Austria is
   actually the floor above the floor at street level (2nd floor in US)
   -- not considering the fact that, in old buildings, there might be
   even more floors between street level and 1st floor, like "mezzanine"
   and "2nd mezzanine".  So, an Austrian "1st floor" could well be the
   "4th floor" according to US nomenclature.

   According to Statistik Austria [adrwarten], 81.5% of Austrian
   addresses are of the simple type Musterstrasse 1 (Musterstrasse is an
   example street name). 5% of all addresses have an additional
   character, like Musterstrasse 1b. 1% of Austrian addresses look like
   Musterstrasse 21A - 23A.  For 8% of addresses, an additional
   separator is necessary -- like Musterstrasse 10 Haus 1 Stiege 2, or
   Musterstrasse 20 Gruppe A Reihe 1 Parzelle 13, or Musterstrasse 30
   Weg 1 Parzelle 10.  Very seldom, there are so-called special
   addresses (0.03%) -- for example, Musterstrasse gegenueber 3A,
   meaning this address is actually opposite of house number 3A.  Rather
   surprisingly, 4.47% of Austrian addresses contain the identifier of
   the estate since no house number is assigned at all -- for example,
   Musterstrasse GNR 1234, or Musterstrasse GNR .12/4 Kirche (this type
   of addresses is common for churches), or a real example in Stockerau:

   Kolomaniwoerth GNR 1583.  This identifier is stored by Statistik
   Austria as Hausnummerntext.  Otherwise, one could misinterpret this
   number as a house number, which would be definitely wrong.

A.2.  Sample Addresses

   In order to clarify the Austrian civic address format, this section
   provides some exemplary addresses:

   1234 Musterstadt, Hauptstrasse 1a - 5a Block 1b Haus 2c Stiege 1
   Postleitzahl: 1234
   Stadt: Musterstadt
   Strasse: Hauptstrasse
   Hausnummer - 1.  Teil - Nummer: 1
   Hausnummer - 1.  Teil - Buchstabe: a
   Hausnummer - Verbindungszeichen Teil 1 -> Bis: -
   Hausnummer - 2.  Teil - Nummer: 5
   Hausnummer - 2.  Teil - Buchstabe: a
   Hausnummer - Verbindungszeichen Teil Bis -> Teil 2: Block
   Hausnummer - 2.  Teil - Nummer: 1
   Hausnummer - 2.  Teil - Buchstabe: b
   Hausnummer - Verbindungszeichen Teil 2-> Teil 3: Haus
   Hausnummer - 3.  Teil - Nummer: 2
   Hausnummer - 3.  Teil - Buchstabe: c
   Gebaeudeunterscheidung: Stiege 1

   1234 Musterstadt, Musterstrasse 13 Hotel
   Postleitzahl: 1234
   Stadt: Musterstadt
   Strasse: Musterstrasse
   Hausnummer - 1. Teil - Nummer: 13
   Gebaeudeunterscheidung: Hotel

   Hausnummer: 35

   6173 Oberperfuss, Riedl 3097 (Pfarrkirche)
   Postleitzahl: 6173
   Stadt: Oberperfuss
   Strasse: Riedl
   Hausnummerntext: 3097
   (since the estate identifier is 81305 3097, where 81305 is the

   Katastralgemeindenummer (cadastral municipality), and no house
   number is assigned)
   Vulgoname: Pfarrkirche

A.3.  Address Codes in Austria

   Statistik Austria registers 4 codes: Adresscode, Adresssubcode,
   Objektnummer, and the Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer.  The Adresscode (7
   digits) is a unique code for an address in Austria.  The
   Adressregister maps the Adresscode to the civic address.  If there is
   a building located at an address, there is also an Adresssubcode (3
   digits) assigned.  Every building at an address has its own
   Adresssubcode (assigned sequentially starting with 001, 002, 003, and
   so on) in order to distinguish between buildings at the same address.
   Furthermore, every building located in Austria has its own unique
   code, the Objektnummer (7 digits).  This code identifies the building
   independent of the Adresscode.  That's because addresses are subject
   to change while the building may persist.  To differentiate multiple
   usable units inside a building, the Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer (4
   digits) is used.  This code is also assigned in sequential order for
   each building.

   Besides, every address and building is geocoded by Statistik Austria.
   Hence, if every PIDF-LO would carry data in the format of Statistik
   Austria and if every PSAP would use the database of Statistik Austria
   for mapping, a time-saving, definite mapping without irregularities
   could be achieved.

   Besides these codes, Statistik Austria maintains reference numbers
   for communes, localities, or streets, to mention just a few.

A.4.  Austrian Addresses in PIDF-LO

   The following subsections define the mapping procedure.

A.4.1.  Country

   The country Element for Austria must be set to AT, since this is the
   ISO 3166-1 [ISO3166-1] alpha-2 code for Austria.

   <country>AT</country>

   The usage of the ISO 3166 code is demanded by RFC 4119 [RFC4119], and
   RFC 5139 [RFC5139] proposes to use uppercase characters only.

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


A.4.2.  Country Subdivisions A1-A6

   A1 province (Bundesland), Section A.4.2.1
   A2 political district name or identifier (politischer Bezirk),
      Section A.4.2.2
   A3 commune name or identifier (Gemeinde), Section A.4.2.3
   A4 village name or identifier (Ortschaft), Section A.4.2.4
   A5 cadastral municipality name or identifier (Katastralgemeindename
      or Katastralgemeindenummer), Section A.4.2.5

   Element A6 must not be used.

   Last, there is an exception to mention that concerns the Austrian
   capital, Vienna (Wien).  The city of Vienna is equal to its political
   district and even the province is called Vienna.  Nevertheless,
   Vienna is separated in 23 districts within the same political
   district.  Consequently, an address in Vienna would look like:

   <country>AT</country>
   <A1>Wien</A1>
   <A2>Wien</A2>
   <A3>Wien</A3>
   <A4>Favoriten</A4> or <A4>10<A4>
   <A5>Inzersdorf Stadt<A5>

   The Element A4, holding the city division, can hold the name or the
   number of the district.

A.4.2.1.  A1 Element

   As proposed in RFC 5139 [RFC5139], for the PIDF-LO Element A1, the
   second part of ISO 3166-2 [ISO3166-2] can be used.  However, in
   Austria it is also common to write out the names of the states.
   Table 4 shows the possible values of the A1 Element for Austrian
   states.

   (Note: values are shown in UTF-8, which is recommended to be used for
   PIDF-LO.)

A.4.2.2.  A2 Element

   Names of the Austrian political districts are available at Statistik
   Austria [bezirke].  These names, the unique code for the political
   district, or both can be used for the A2 Element.  If the content of
   the A2 Element is numeric, obviously the code is provided (there is
   no political district in Austria with a number in its name).  In case
   both the name and the code are provided, they are separated by a
   semicolon and the name must be listed first.

   The district of "Bruck an der Leitha" could be represented by:

   <A2>Bruck an der Leitha<A2>

   or
   <A2>307</A2>

   or
   <A2>Bruck an der Leitha;307</A2>

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


A.4.2.3.  A3 Element

   The Element A3 holds the Gemeindename (commune name), the identifier
   of the Gemeinde, or both separated by a semicolon (the name must be
   listed first).  If the content of the A3 Element consists of a number
   only, it is obvious that just the identifier is provided.  Statistik
   Austria maintains a table with the Gemeindenamen and identifiers
   [gemeinden], which must be used as the content for the A3 Element; no
   other spelling is allowed.

   Sample:

   <A3>Neusiedl am See</A3>

   or
   <A3>10713</A3>

   or
   <A3>Neusiedl am See;10713</A3>

A.4.2.4.  A4 Element

   The Element A4 holds the Ortschaftsname (village name), the
   Ortschaftskennziffer (the identifier), or both separated by a
   semicolon (the name must be listed first).  If the content of the A4
   Element consists of a number only, it is obvious that just the
   identifier is provided, since there are no Ortschaftsnamen in Austria
   that contain a number.  Statistik Austria maintains a table with the
   Ortschaftsnamen and identifiers [ortschaften], which must be used as
   the content for the A4 Element; no other spelling is allowed.

   Sample:

   <A4>Wilfleinsdorf</A4>

   or
   <A4>03448</A4>

   or
   <A4>Wilfleinsdorf;03448</A4>

A.4.2.5.  A5 Element

   The Element A5 holds the Katastralgemeindename (cadastral
   municipality), the Katastralgemeindenummer (the identifier), or both
   separated by a semicolon (the name must be listed first).  If the

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   content of the A5 Element consists of a number only, it is obvious
   that just the identifier is provided, since there are no
   Katastralgemeindenamen in Austria that contain a number.

   Sample (Vienna, Fuenfhaus):

   <A5>Oberbaumgarten</A5>

   or
   <A5>1208</A5>

   or
   <A5>Oberbaumgarten;1208</A5>

A.4.3.  Road and Street Names

   The PIDF-LO Element RD holds the complete street name, including the
   street suffix.  No abbreviations are allowed.  No other Elements are
   needed for streets and must not be used.

A.4.4.  House Numbers

   Statistik Austria lists 14 data Fields related to the house number of
   a building plus another 5 Fields for distinction of different usable
   units inside a building (including the floor, which has a separate
   Element in PIDF-LO).  Unfortunately, PIDF-LO only defines a single
   house number Element (HNO, numeric part only) and house number suffix
   Element (HNS).  Therefore, this section defines a mapping in order to
   accommodate all data: all house number data is concatenated into a
   single HNO Element, even though it is expected to hold numeric part
   only.

   In order to allow automatic procession of the HNO Element, it is
   necessary to use a semicolon as a delimiter symbol (Austrian house
   numbers do not contain semicolons).  The house number parts MUST be
   provided in the order in which they are listed by the Statistik
   Austria document [merkmalskatalog].  For user-interface
   representation, the semicolon-separated format can be transformed by
   replacing semicolons by spaces (multiple spaces should be combined)
   and no space should be present between a numeric part of a house
   number and its related character.

   It is not allowed to use the HNS Element for Austrian addresses,
   since there are addresses that do not have just a single suffix.

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   The house number "vor 1 - 1A" (consisting of a house number text
   "vor", first part of the house number numeric "1", "-" as the link of
   the first and Bis part, "1" as house number Bis part numeric, "A" as
   character of the Bis part) would be mapped to:

   <HNO>vor;1;;-;1;A;;;;;;;;;;;</HNO>

A.4.5.  Local Names

   NAM: contains the Vulgoname (local name); multiple local names are
        separated by a semicolon (if applicable).

   LMK: contains the farm name (just one name possible) (if applicable).

   LOC: can be used without restriction for additional location
        information (as per RFC 4119).

A.4.6.  Floors

   The floor Element may contain numbers or text describing the floor.
   The first floor (<FLR>1</FLR>) is the floor above the floor at street
   level.  The floor at street level is <FLR>EG</FLR> or <FLR>0</FLR>.
   Other floors may have names like mezzanine, for example.  The
   Statistik Austria data Fields Lage and Stockwerk are concatenated if
   necessary.

A.4.7.  Additional Code Element

   The Element additional code may be used to hold the codes provided by
   Statistik Austria.  There is an Adresscode, Adresssubcode,
   Objektnummer, and a Nutzungseinheitenlaufnummer.  These unique codes
   identify the location.  Actually, these codes alone would be enough
   but require that the location recipient has access to the database of
   Statistik Austria.

   If the additional code in a PIDF-LO document is going to hold the
   codes from Statistik Austria, the following format should be used:

   <ADDCODE>AdrCD=1234567;AdrsubCD=123;
   ObjNr=2333211;NtzLnr=0001</ADDCODE>

   It is not necessary to provide all codes, but there are some
   restrictions: the Adresssubcode cannot be used without an Adresscode.
   More restrictions are defined by Statistik Austria.  By setting the
   country Element to AT (see Section 4.2.1), indicating an Austrian
   address, the Additional Code Element is expected to hold codes from





Wolf & Mayrhofer          Best Current Practice                [Page 28]

RFC 5774              Civic Address Considerations            March 2010


   Statistik Austria only.  When creating PIDF-LO documents using
   address codes by Statistik Austria, the country and ADDCODE Elements
   are mandatory.

A.4.8.  Other Elements

   The Elements PC and PCN can hold the data form Statistik Austria, the
   POBOX can be used if the post assigned a post office box.  At least
   the PC Element should be present.

   PC:    Postleitzahl (postal code)

   PCN:   Postleitzahlengebiet (postal community name)

   POBOX: Postfach

   The Elements UNIT, ROOM, SEAT, PLC, and BLD may be used without
   further restriction.
