1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet

RFC 2933         Internet Group Management Protocol MIB     October 2000


   Group Management Protocol (IGMP), version 1 [16] or version 2 [17].
   A future version of this MIB will support IGMP version 3 (currently a
   work in progress).  All of this MIB module is applicable to IPv4
   multicast routers; a subset is applicable to hosts implementing IGMP.
   Since IGMP is specific to IPv4, this MIB does not support management
   of equivalent functionality for other address families, such as IPv6.
   Such management may be supported by other MIBs.

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC
        2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
        RFC 2574 [12].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically



McCloghrie, et al.          Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 2933         Internet Group Management Protocol MIB     October 2000


   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   This MIB module contains two tables:

   (1)  the IGMP Interface Table which contains one row for each
        interface on which IGMP is enabled, and

   (2)  the IGMP Cache Table which contains one row for each IP
        multicast group for which there are members on a particular
        interface.

   Both tables are intended to be implemented by hosts and routers, but
   some columnar objects in each table apply only to routers.

5.  Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to multicast sessions.  Some of these objects could contain
   sensitive information.  In particular, the igmpCacheSelf and
   igmpCacheLastReporter can be used to identify machines which are
   listening to a given group address.  There are also a number of
   objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-
   create, which allow an administrator to configure IGMP in the router.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause
   a denial of service.  Hence, the support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to access them.
