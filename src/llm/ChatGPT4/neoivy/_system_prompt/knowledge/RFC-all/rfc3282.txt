Abstract

   This document defines a "Content-language:" header, for use in cases
   where one desires to indicate the language of something that has RFC
   822-like headers, like MIME body parts or Web documents, and an
   "Accept-Language:" header for use in cases where one wishes to
   indicate one's preferences with regard to language.

1. Introduction

   There are a number of languages presently or previously used by human
   beings in this world.

   A great number of these people would prefer to have information
   presented in a language which they understand.

   In some contexts, it is possible to have information available in
   more than one language, or it might be possible to provide tools
   (such as dictionaries) to assist in the understanding of a language.

   In other cases, it may be desirable to use a computer program to
   convert information from one format (such as plaintext) into another
   (such as computer-synthesized speech, or Braille, or high-quality
   print renderings).

RFC 3282                Content Language Headers                May 2002


   A prerequisite for any such function is a means of labelling the
   information content with an identifier for the language that is used
   in this information content, such as is defined by [TAGS].  This
   document specifies a protocol element for use with protocols that use
   RFC 822-like headers for carrying language tags as defined in [TAGS].

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

2. The Content-language header

   The "Content-Language" header is intended for use in the case where
   one desires to indicate the language(s) of something that has RFC
   822-like headers, such as MIME body parts or Web documents.

   The RFC 822 EBNF of the Content-Language header is:

      Content-Language = "Content-Language" ":" 1#Language-tag

   In the more strict RFC 2234 ABNF:

      Content-Language = "Content-Language" ":" [CFWS] Language-List
      Language-List = Language-Tag [CFWS]
                         *("," [CFWS] Language-Tag [CFWS])

   The Content-Language header may list several languages in a comma-
   separated list.

   The CFWS construct is intended to function like the whitespace
   convention in RFC 822, which means also that one can place
   parenthesized comments anywhere in the language sequence, or use
   continuation lines.  A formal definition is given in RFC 2822
   [RFC2822].

   In keeping with the tradition of RFC 2822, a more liberal "obsolete"
   grammar is also given:

      obs-content-language = "Content-Language" *WSP ":"
                              [CFWS] Language-List

   Like RFC 2822, this specification says that conforming
   implementations MUST accept the obs-content-language syntax, but MUST
   NOT generate it; all generated headers MUST conform to the Content-
   Language syntax.

RFC 3282                Content Language Headers                May 2002


2.1 Examples of Content-language values

   Voice recording from Liverpool downtown

      Content-type: audio/basic
      Content-Language: en-scouse

   Document in Mingo, an American Indian language which does not have an
   ISO 639 code:

      Content-type: text/plain
      Content-Language: i-mingo

   A English-French dictionary

      Content-type: application/dictionary
      Content-Language: en, fr (This is a dictionary)

   An official European Commission document (in a few of its official
   languages):

      Content-type: multipart/alternative
      Content-Language: da, de, el, en, fr, it

   An excerpt from Star Trek

      Content-type: video/mpeg
      Content-Language: i-klingon

3. The Accept-Language header

   The "Accept-Language" header is intended for use in cases where a
   user or a process desires to identify the preferred language(s) when
   RFC 822-like headers, such as MIME body parts or Web documents, are
   used.

   The RFC 822 EBNF of the Accept-Language header is:

      Accept-Language = "Accept-Language" ":"
                             1#( language-range [ ";" "q" "=" qvalue ] )

   A slightly more restrictive RFC 2234 ABNF definition is:

      Accept-Language = "Accept-Language:" [CFWS] language-q
                        *( "," [CFWS] language-q )
      language-q = language-range [";" [CFWS] "q=" qvalue ] [CFWS]
      qvalue         = ( "0" [ "." 0*3DIGIT ] )
                     / ( "1" [ "." 0*3("0") ] )

RFC 3282                Content Language Headers                May 2002



   A more liberal RFC 2234 ABNF definition is:

      Obs-accept-language = "Accept-Language" *WSP ":" [CFWS]
           obs-language-q *( "," [CFWS] obs-language-q ) [CFWS]
      obs-language-q = language-range
            [ [CFWS] ";" [CFWS] "q" [CFWS] "=" qvalue ]

   Like RFC 2822, this specification says that conforming
   implementations MUST accept the obs-accept-language syntax, but MUST
   NOT generate it; all generated messages MUST conform to the Accept-
   Language syntax.

   The syntax and semantics of language-range is defined in [TAGS].  The
   Accept-Language header may list several language-ranges in a comma-
   separated list, and each may include a quality value Q.  If no Q
   values are given, the language-ranges are given in priority order,
   with the leftmost language-range being the most preferred language;
   this is an extension to the HTTP/1.1 rules, but matches current
   practice.

   If Q values are given, refer to HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2616] for the details
   on how to evaluate it.

4. Security Considerations

   The only security issue that has been raised with language tags since
   the publication of RFC 1766, which stated that "Security issues are
   believed to be irrelevant to this memo", is a concern with language
   ranges used in content negotiation - that they may be used to infer
   the nationality of the sender, and thus identify potential targets
   for surveillance.

   This is a special case of the general problem that anything you send
   is visible to the receiving party; it is useful to be aware that such
   concerns can exist in some cases.

   The exact magnitude of the threat, and any possible countermeasures,
   is left to each application protocol.

5. Character set considerations

   This document adds no new considerations beyond what is mentioned in
   [TAGS].

Appendix A: Changes from RFC 1766

   The definition of the language tags has been split, and is now RFC
   3066.  The differences parameter to multipart/alternative is no
   longer part of this standard, because no implementations of the
   function were ever found.  Consult RFC 1766 if you need the
   information.

   The ABNF for content-language has been updated to use the RFC 2234
   ABNF.
