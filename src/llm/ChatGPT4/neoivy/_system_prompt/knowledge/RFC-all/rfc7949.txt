                  OSPFv3 over IPv4 for IPv6 Transition

Abstract

   This document defines a mechanism to use IPv4 to transport OSPFv3
   packets.  Using OSPFv3 over IPv4 with the existing OSPFv3 Address
   Family extension can simplify transition from an OSPFv2 IPv4-only
   routing domain to an OSPFv3 dual-stack routing domain.  This document
   updates RFC 5838 to support virtual links in the IPv4 unicast address
   family when using OSPFv3 over IPv4.

1.  Introduction

   Using OSPFv3 [RFC5340] over IPv4 [RFC791] with the existing OSPFv3
   address family extension can simplify transition from an IPv4-only
   routing domain to an IPv6 [RFC2460] or dual-stack routing domain.
   Dual-stack routing protocols, such as the Border Gateway Protocol
   [RFC4271], have an advantage during the transition, because both IPv4
   and IPv6 address families can be advertised using either IPv4 or IPv6
   transport.  Some IPv4-specific and IPv6-specific routing protocols
   share enough similarities in their protocol packet formats and
   protocol signaling that it is trivial to deploy an initial IPv6
   routing domain by transporting the routing protocol over IPv4,
   thereby allowing IPv6 routing domains to be deployed and tested
   before decommissioning IPv4 and moving to an IPv6-only network.

   In the case of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) interior gateway
   routing protocol (IGP), OSPFv2 [RFC2328] is the IGP deployed over
   IPv4, while OSPFv3 [RFC5340] is the IGP deployed over IPv6.  OSPFv3
   further supports multiple address families [RFC5838], including both
   the IPv6 unicast address family and the IPv4 unicast address family.
   Consequently, it is possible to deploy OSPFv3 over IPv4 without any
   changes to either OSPFv3 or IPv4.  During the transition to IPv6,
   future OSPF extensions can focus on OSPFv3, and OSPFv2 can move to
   maintenance mode.

   This document specifies how to use IPv4 to transport OSPFv3 packets.
   The mechanism takes advantage of the fact that OSPFv2 and OSPFv3
   share the same IP protocol number, 89.  Additionally, the OSPF packet
   header for both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3 includes the OSPF header version

   (i.e., the field that distinguishes an OSPFv2 packet from an OSPFv3
   packet) in the same location (i.e., the same offset from the start of
   the header).

   If the IPv4 topology and IPv6 topology are not identical, the most
   likely cause is that some parts of the network deployment have not
   yet been upgraded to support both IPv4 and IPv6.  In situations where
   the IPv4 deployment is a superset of the IPv6 deployment, it is
   expected that OSPFv3 packets would be transported over IPv4, until
   the rest of the network deployment is upgraded to support IPv6 in
   addition to IPv4.  In situations where the IPv6 deployment is a
   superset of the IPv4 deployment, it is expected that OSPFv3 would be
   transported over IPv6.

   Throughout this document, "OSPF" is used when the text applies to
   both OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.  "OSPFv2" or "OSPFv3" is used when the text
   is specific to one version of the OSPF protocol.  Similarly, "IP" is
   used when the text describes either version of the Internet Protocol.
   "IPv4" or "IPv6" is used when the text is specific to a single
   version of the Internet Protocol.

1.1.  IPv4-Only Use Case

   OSPFv3 only requires IPv6 link-local addresses to form adjacencies,
   and does not require IPv6 global-scope addresses to establish an IPv6
   routing domain.  However, IPv6 over Ethernet [RFC2464] uses a
   different EtherType (0x86dd) from IPv4 (0x0800) and the Address
   Resolution Protocol (ARP) (0x0806) [RFC826] used with IPv4.

   Some existing deployed link-layer equipment only supports IPv4 and
   ARP.  Such equipment contains hardware filters keyed on the EtherType
   field of the Ethernet frame to filter which frames will be accepted
   by that link-layer equipment.  Because IPv6 uses a different
   EtherType, IPv6 framing for OSPFv3 will not work with that equipment.
   In other cases, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) might be used over a
   serial interface, but again only IPv4 over PPP might be supported
   over such an interface.  It is hoped that equipment with such
   limitations will be eventually upgraded or replaced.

   In some locations, especially locations with less communications
   infrastructure, satellite communications (SATCOM) are used to reduce
   deployment costs for data networking.  SATCOM often has lower cost to
   deploy than running new copper or optical cables over long distances
   to connect remote areas.  Also, in a wide range of locations
   including places with good communications infrastructure, Very Small
   Aperture Terminals (VSATs) often are used by banks and retailers to
   connect their branches and stores to a central location.

RFC 7949          OSPFv3 over IPv4 for IPv6 Transition       August 2016


   Some widely deployed VSAT equipment has either (A) Ethernet
   interfaces that only support the Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol
   (ARP) and IPv4, or (B) serial interfaces that only support IPv4 and
   PPP packets.  Such deployments and equipment still can deploy and use
   OSPFv3 over IPv4 today, and then later migrate to OSPFv3 over IPv6
   after equipment is upgraded or replaced.  This can have lower
   operational costs than running OSPFv2 and then trying to make a flag-
   day switch to OSPFv3.  By running OSPFv3 over IPv4 now, the eventual
   transition to dual-stack, and then to IPv6-only, can be orchestrated.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Encapsulation in IPv4

   An OSPFv3 packet can be directly encapsulated within an IPv4 packet
   as the payload, without the IPv6 packet header, as illustrated in
   Figure 1.  For OSPFv3 transported over IPv4, the IPv4 packet has an
   IPv4 protocol type of 89, denoting that the payload is an OSPF
   packet.  The payload of the IPv4 packet consists of an OSPFv3 packet,
   beginning with the OSPF packet header having its OSPF version field
   set to 3.

   An OSPFv3 packet followed by an OSPF link-local signaling (LLS)
   extension data block [RFC5613] encapsulated in an IPv4 packet is
   illustrated in Figure 2.

   Since an IPv4 header without options is only 20 octets long and is
   shorter than an IPv6 header, an OSPFv3 packet encapsulated in a
   20-octet IPv4 header is shorter than an OSPFv3 packet encapsulated in
   an IPv6 header.  Consequently, the link MTU for IPv6 is sufficient to
   transport an OSPFv3 packet encapsulated in a 20-octet IPv4 header.
   If the link MTU is not sufficient to transport an OSPFv3 packet in
   IPv4, then OSPFv3 can rely on IP fragmentation and reassembly
   [RFC791].

RFC 7949          OSPFv3 over IPv4 for IPv6 Transition       August 2016


3.1.  Source Address

   For OSPFv3 over IPv4, the source address is the primary IPv4 address
   for the interface over which the packet is transmitted.  All OSPFv3
   routers on the link should share the same IPv4 subnet for IPv4
   transport to function correctly.

   While OSPFv2 operates on a subnet, OSPFv3 operates on a link
   [RFC5340].  Accordingly, an OSPFv3 router implementation MAY support
   adjacencies with OSPFv3 neighbors on different IPv4 subnets.  If this
   is supported, the IPv4 data plane MUST resolve IPv4 addresses to
   Layer 2 addresses using ARP on multi-access networks and point-to-
   point over LAN [RFC5309] for direct next hops on different IPv4
   subnets.  When OSPFv3 adjacencies on different IPv4 subnets are
   supported, Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5881] cannot
   be used for adjacency loss detection since BFD is restricted to a
   single subnet.

3.2.  Destination Address

   As defined in OSPFv2, the IPv4 destination address of an OSPF
   protocol packet is either an IPv4 multicast address or the IPv4
   unicast address of an OSPFv2 neighbor.  Two well-known link-local
   multicast addresses are assigned to OSPFv2, the AllSPFRouters address
   (224.0.0.5) and the AllDRouters address (224.0.0.6).  The multicast
   address used depends on the OSPF packet type, the OSPF interface
   type, and the OSPF router's role on multi-access networks.

   Thus, for an OSPFv3-over-IPv4 packet to be sent to AllSPFRouters, the
   destination address field in the IPv4 packet MUST be 224.0.0.5.  For
   an OSPFv3-over-IPv4 packet to be sent to AllDRouters, the destination
   address field in the IPv4 packet MUST be 224.0.0.6.

   When an OSPF router sends a unicast OSPF packet over a connected
   interface, the destination of such an IP packet is the address
   assigned to the receiving interface.  Thus, a unicast OSPFv3 packet
   transported in an IPv4 packet would specify the OSPFv3 neighbor's
   IPv4 address as the destination address.

3.3.  OSPFv3 Header Checksum

   For IPv4 transport, the pseudo-header used in the checksum
   calculation will contain the IPv4 source and destination addresses,
   the OSPFv3 protocol ID, and the OSPFv3 length from the OSPFv3 header
   (Appendix A.3.1 of [RFC5340]).  The format is similar to the UDP
   pseudo-header as described in [RFC768] and is illustrated in
   Figure 3.

             Figure 3: Pseudo-header for OSPFv3 over IPv4

3.4.  Operation over Virtual Links

   When an OSPF router sends an OSPF packet over a virtual link, the
   receiving router might not be directly connected to the sending
   router.  Thus, the destination IP address of the IP packet must be a
   reachable unicast IP address for the virtual link endpoint.  Because
   IPv6 is the presumed Internet protocol and an IPv4 destination is not
   routable, the OSPFv3 address family extension [RFC5838] specifies
   that only virtual links in the IPv6 address family are supported.

   As illustrated in Figure 1, this document specifies OSPFv3 transport
   over IPv4.  As a result, OSPFv3 virtual links can be supported with
   IPv4 address families by simply setting the IPv4 destination address
   to a reachable IPv4 unicast address for the virtual link endpoint.
   Hence, the restriction in Section 2.8 of RFC 5838 [RFC5838] is
   relaxed since virtual links can now be supported for IPv4 address
   families as long as the transport is also IPv4.  If IPv4 transport,
   as specified herein, is used for IPv6 address families, virtual links
   cannot be supported. Hence, in OSPF routing domains that require
   virtual links, the IP transport MUST match the address family (IPv4
   or IPv6).

4.  Management Considerations

4.1.  Coexistence with OSPFv2

   Since OSPFv2 [RFC2328] and OSPFv3 over IPv4 as described herein use
   exactly the same protocol and IPv4 addresses, OSPFv2 packets may be
   delivered to the OSPFv3 process and vice versa.  When this occurs,
   the mismatched protocol packets will be dropped due to validation of
   the version in the first octet of the OSPFv2/OSPFv3 protocol header.
   Note that this will not prevent the packets from being delivered to
   the correct protocol process as standard socket implementations will
   deliver a copy to each socket matching the selectors.

RFC 7949          OSPFv3 over IPv4 for IPv6 Transition       August 2016


   Implementations of OSPFv3 over IPv4 transport SHOULD implement
   separate counters for a protocol mismatch and SHOULD provide means to
   suppress the ospfIfRxBadPacket and ospfVirtIfRxBadPacket SNMP
   notifications as described in [RFC4750] and the ospfv3IfRxBadPacket
   and ospv3VirtIfRxBadPacket SNMP notifications as described in
   [RFC5643] when an OSPFv2 packet is received by the OSPFv3 process or
   vice versa.

5.  Security Considerations

   OSPFv3 [RFC5340] relies on IPsec [RFC4301] for authentication and
   confidentiality.  "Authentication/Confidentiality in OSPFv3"
   [RFC4552] specifies how IPsec is used with OSPFv3 over IPv6
   transport.  In order to use OSPFv3 with IPv4 transport as specified
   herein, further work such as "Authentication/Confidentiality in
   OSPFv2" [IPsec-OSPF] would be required.

   An optional OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer [RFC7166] also has been
   defined as an alternative to using IPsec.  The calculation of the
   authentication data in the Authentication Trailer includes the source
   IPv6 address to protect an OSPFv3 router from man-in-the-middle
   attacks.  For IPv4 encapsulation as described herein, the IPv4 source
   address should be placed in the first 4 octets of Apad followed by
   the hexadecimal value 0x878FE1F3 repeated (L-4)/4 times, where L is
   the length of the hash measured in octets.

   The processing of the optional Authentication Trailer is contained
   entirely within the OSPFv3 protocol.  In other words, each OSPFv3
   router instance is responsible for the authentication, without
   involvement from IPsec or any other IP-layer function.  Consequently,
   except for calculation of the Apad value, transporting OSPFv3 packets
   using IPv4 does not change the generation or validation of the
   optional OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer.
