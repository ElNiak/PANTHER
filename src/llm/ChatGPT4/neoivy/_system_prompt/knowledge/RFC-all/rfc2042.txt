                  Registering New BGP Attribute Types

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

Process:

   This document describes the process for creating new BGP attribute
   type codes.  Basic attribute type codes are described in RFC 1771,
   pages 12 through 15.  These, and new attribute type codes that are
   used in the Internet are registered with the IANA.

   The actual process will involve the documentation of such attribute
   type codes in an RFC.  There is no intention of segmenting the code
   space into public/private or IP/OSI or any other sectioning.

   As each attribute type code is in the process of being developed, it
   will use an octet value of 255, which will be reserved for this use.
   At the time an attribute type code is assigned a number by the IANA,
   the documetnation and code base will be updated to reflect the
   authorized attribute type code value.

   IANA maintained values will be published in the periodically updated
   Assigned Numbers RFC [6].  Requests for assignment of a new attribute
   type code should be sent to the IANA (IANA@IANA.ORG) with a subject
   that includes the phrase "BGP Attribute Type".
