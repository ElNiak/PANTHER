    Applicability Statement: DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm
                         Implementation Status

Abstract

   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of
   cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over
   DNS data.  There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms,
   but there is no record of the recommended implementation status of
   each algorithm.  This document provides an applicability statement on
   algorithm implementation status for DNSSEC component software.  This
   document lists each algorithm's status based on the current
   reference.  In the case that an algorithm is specified without an
   implementation status, this document assigns one.  This document
   updates RFCs 2536, 2539, 3110, 4034, 4398, 5155, 5702, and 5933.

RFC 6944             DNSSEC DNSKEY Algorithm Status           April 2013


1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) Security Extensions (DNSSEC) ([RFC4033],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4035], [RFC4509], [RFC5155], and [RFC5702]) uses
   digital signatures over DNS data to provide source authentication and
   integrity protection.  DNSSEC uses an IANA registry to list codes for
   digital signature algorithms (consisting of a cryptographic algorithm
   and one-way hash function).

   The original list of algorithm status is found in [RFC4034].  Other
   DNSSEC RFCs have added new algorithms or changed the status of
   algorithms in the registry.  However, implementers must read through
   all the documents in order to discover which algorithms are
   considered wise to implement, which are not, and which algorithms may
   become widely used in the future.

   This document defines the current implementation status for all
   registered algorithms.  If the status of algorithms changes, this
   document will be replaced with a new one establishing the new status;
   see Section 2.4.

   This document updates the following: [RFC2536], [RFC2539], [RFC3110],
   [RFC4034], [RFC4398], [RFC5155], [RFC5702], and [RFC5933].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The DNS Security Algorithm Implementation Status Lists

2.1.  Status Definitions

   Must Implement:  The algorithm MUST be implemented to interoperate
      with other implementations of this specification.

   Must Not Implement:  The algorithm MUST NOT be implemented.  An
      algorithm with this status has known weaknesses.

   Recommended to Implement:  The algorithm SHOULD be implemented.
      Utility and interoperability with other implementations will be
      improved when an algorithm with this status is implemented, though
      there might be occasions where it is reasonable not to implement
      the algorithm.  An implementer must understand and weigh the full
      implications of choosing not to implement this particular
      algorithm.

RFC 6944             DNSSEC DNSKEY Algorithm Status           April 2013


   Optional:  The algorithm MAY be implemented, but all implementations
      MUST be prepared to interoperate with implementations that do or
      do not implement this algorithm.

2.2.  Algorithm Implementation Status Assignment Rationale

   RSASHA1 has an implementation status of Must Implement, consistent
   with [RFC4034].  RSAMD5 has an implementation status of Must Not
   Implement because of known weaknesses in MD5.

   The status of RSASHA1-NSEC3-SHA1 is set to Recommended to Implement
   as many deployments use NSEC3.  The status of RSA/SHA-256 and RSA/
   SHA-512 are also set to Recommended to Implement as major deployments
   (such as the root zone) use these algorithms [ROOTDPS].  It is
   believed that RSA/SHA-256 or RSA/SHA-512 algorithms will replace
   older algorithms (e.g., RSA/SHA-1) that have a perceived weakness.

   Likewise, ECDSA with the two identified curves (ECDSAP256SHA256 and
   ECDSAP384SHA384) is an algorithm that may see widespread use due to
   the perceived similar level of security offered with smaller key size
   compared to the key sizes of algorithms such as RSA.  Therefore,
   ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSAP384SHA384 are Recommended to Implement.

   All other algorithms used in DNSSEC specified without an
   implementation status are currently set to Optional.

2.3.  DNSSEC Implementation Status Table

   The DNSSEC algorithm implementation status table is listed below.
   Only the algorithms already specified for use with DNSSEC at the time
   of writing are listed.

    +------------+------------+-------------------+-------------------+
    |    Must    |  Must Not  |    Recommended    |      Optional     |
    |  Implement | Implement  |   to Implement    |                   |
    +------------+------------+-------------------+-------------------+
    |            |            |                   |                   |
    |   RSASHA1  |   RSAMD5   |   RSASHA256       |   Any             |
    |            |            |   RSASHA1-NSEC3   |   registered      |
    |            |            |    -SHA1          |   algorithm       |
    |            |            |   RSASHA512       |   not listed in   |
    |            |            |   ECDSAP256SHA256 |   this table      |
    |            |            |   ECDSAP384SHA384 |                   |
    +------------+------------+-------------------+-------------------+

RFC 6944             DNSSEC DNSKEY Algorithm Status           April 2013


   This table does not list the Reserved values in the IANA registry
   table or the values for INDIRECT (252), PRIVATE (253), and PRIVATEOID
   (254).  These values may relate to more than one algorithm and are
   therefore up to the implementer's discretion.  As noted, any
   algorithm not listed in the table is Optional.  As of this writing,
   the Optional algorithms are DSASHA1, DH, DSA-NSEC3-SHA1, and GOST-
   ECC, but in general, anything not explicitly listed is Optional.

2.4.  Specifying New Algorithms and Updating the Status of Existing
      Entries

   [RFC6014] establishes a parallel procedure for adding a registry
   entry for a new algorithm other than a standards track document.
   Because any algorithm not listed in the foregoing table is Optional,
   algorithms entered into the registry using the [RFC6014] procedure
   are automatically Optional.

   It has turned out to be useful for implementations to refer to a
   single document that specifies the implementation status of every
   algorithm.  Accordingly, when a new algorithm is to be registered
   with a status other than Optional, this document shall be made
   obsolete by a new document that adds the new algorithm to the table
   in Section 2.3.  Similarly, if the status of any algorithm in the
   table in Section 2.3 changes, a new document shall make this document
   obsolete; that document shall include a replacement of the table in
   Section 2.3.  This way, the goal of having one authoritative document
   to specify all the status values is achieved.

   This document cannot be updated, only made obsolete and replaced by a
   successor document.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document lists the implementation status of cryptographic
   algorithms used with DNSSEC.  These algorithms are maintained in an
   IANA registry at http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers.
   Because this document establishes the implementation status of every
   algorithm, it has been listed as a reference for the registry itself.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document lists, and in some cases assigns, the implementation
   status of cryptographic algorithms used with DNSSEC.  It is not meant
   to be a discussion on algorithm superiority.  No new security
   considerations are raised in this document, though prior description
   of algorithms as NOT RECOMMENDED (see [RFC4034]) has been recast as
   Must Not Implement.
