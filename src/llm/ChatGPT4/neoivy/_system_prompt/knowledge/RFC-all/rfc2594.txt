1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a set of objects for managing World Wide Web (WWW)
   services. This MIB extends the application management framework
   defined by the System Application Management MIB (SYSAPPL-MIB) [23]
   and the Application Management MIB (APPLICATION-MIB) [24]. The MIB is
   also self-contained so that it can be implemented and used without
   having to implement or install the APPLICATION-MIB or the SYSAPPL-
   MIB.

   The protocol statistics defined in the WWW Service MIB are based on
   an abstract document transfer protocol (DTP). This memo also defines
   a mapping of the abstract DTP to HTTP and FTP.  Additional mappings
   may be defined in the future in order to use this MIB with other
   document transfer protocols. It is anticipated that such future
   mappings will be defined in separate RFCs.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].


2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
        RFC 2574 [12].

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations
        and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


3.  Terminology

   This section defines the terminology used throughout this document.

   o    The 'World Wide Web' (WWW) is a world wide information system
        which is based on the concept of documents that are linked
        together by embedding references (links) to other local or
        remote documents.

   o    A 'document' is a coherent piece of data which is accessible in
        the World Wide Web. No assumptions are made about the content or
        the type of a document.

   o    A 'Uniform Resource Locator' (URL) is a formatted string
        representation for a document available via the Internet. URLs
        are used to express references between documents. For the syntax
        and semantics of the URL string representation refer to RFC 2396
        [18]

   o    A 'Document Transfer Protocol' (DTP) is a protocol used within
        the World Wide Web to invoke actions on documents. The DTP is an
        abstraction from real protocols, such as HTTP [19,20] or FTP
        [21].




Hazewinkel, et al.          Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


   o    A 'request' is a DTP protocol operation which is targeted to a
        'document' and invokes an action on the target document.  The
        request type specifies the action that should be performed. A
        request can have a document associated with it.

   o    A 'response' is a DTP protocol operation which is returned as a
        result of a previous (and associated) request. The response
        status indicates if the requested action was successful or if
        errors occurred. A response can have a document associated with
        it.

   o    A 'WWW service' is a set of actions that can be invoked on a
        document. Typical actions are the transfer of documents or the
        retrieval of administrative information about documents. WWW
        services are provided by means of a DTP. A WWW service can be
        identified by the DTP protocol used to invoke services and the
        transport endpoint used by that protocol.

   o    A 'client' is a program which establishes connections for the
        purpose of sending requests and receiving responses.

   o    A 'server' is a program that accepts connections in order to
        service requests by sending back responses.

   o    A 'proxy' is an intermediary program which acts as both a server
        and a client for the purpose of making requests on behalf of
        other clients.  Requests are serviced internally or by passing
        them on, with possible translation, to other servers.

   o    A 'caching proxy' is a proxy with the capability of locally
        storing responses to associated requests. A caching proxy can
        respond to similar requests with a previously stored response.


4.  Overview

   The World Wide Web (WWW) is a global network of information.
   Information is stored in documents, which can have various formats,
   including hyper-text and multi-media documents. Access to these
   documents is provided by servers which are located all around the
   world and are linked to each other via hyper-links embedded in
   documents.

   The usability of the World Wide Web depends largely on the
   performance of the services realized by these servers. The services
   are typically monitored through log files. This becomes a difficult
   task when a single organization is responsible for a large number of
   services. It is therefore desirable to treat WWW services as objects
   that can be managed by using the Internet network management
   framework [22].


Hazewinkel, et al.          Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


4.1.  Purpose and Requirements

   The goal of this MIB is to define a standardized set of objects which
   lead to integrated and improved performance and fault management in a
   heterogeneous environment of WWW services. This MIB focuses on the
   service-oriented view. It does not deal with the process oriented
   view, which is covered by the System Application MIB [23] and the
   Application MIB [24].

   This document defines a set of managed objects to monitor WWW
   services for short-term operational purposes, such as problem
   detection and troubleshooting. No attempts are made here to cover
   accounting or hit metering issues.

   The scope of the MIB is further limited by the requirement that an
   implementation conforming to this MIB must be possible without
   putting a huge CPU or memory burden on the WWW server implementation.

   In addition, this MIB does not cover WWW service configuration.
   Server software has become an open market where competing vendors
   constantly invent new features in order to shape their products. It
   is therefore not possible to reach consensus on a common way to
   configure WWW services at this point in time.


4.2.  Relationship to other Standards Efforts

   The WWW Service MIB fits into the application management architecture
   defined in the System Application MIB [23]. The System Application
   MIB and the Application MIB [24] use a process-oriented view, where
   an application is viewed as a collection of processes. The WWW
   Service MIB described in this memo uses a service-oriented view,
   which looks at the services provided by a set of processes.

   The relationship between the process-oriented view and the service-
   oriented view is a many-to-many relationship, because one process can
   implement multiple services and multiple services can be implemented
   by a single set of processes. The Application Management MIB [24]
   contains generic mapping tables, which map back and forth between
   both views.

   The WWW Service MIB interfaces to the Application MIB [24] by using
   the service instance identifier (applSrvIndex) for wwwServiceIndex if
   an applicable instance of applSrvIndex is available. The WWW Service
   MIB is self-contained and can be implemented as a stand-alone module
   if the service-level tables in the Application MIB are not available.

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


4.3.  WWW Services

   The MIB is organized around the concept of WWW services. WWW services
   are a set of actions that can be invoked on a document. A WWW service
   is provided or used by either a client, a server or a proxy. Clients
   send out requests for information to server or proxy server. Servers
   receive, process and respond to requests received from clients.
   Servers usually have access to local documents, which can be
   transferred to clients.

   A proxy is a special server, who acts as both a server and a client
   for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients. A
   proxy is able to translate between the client and the origin server.
   A proxy might also interact with other information retrieval system,
   like for example databases.

   The MIB defined in this memo distinguishes between outgoing and
   incoming requests and responses. This makes it possible to obtain
   statistics for clients, servers and proxies with a single set of
   objects.

   A special proxy server is the caching proxy, which maintains a cache
   of previously received documents in order to reduce the bandwidth
   used by World Wide Web clients. One interesting piece of management
   information is the percentage of requests that were served from the
   cache of the caching proxy (hits/miss-ratio). This ratio is not
   contained explicitly in this MIB. Instead, the ratio can be derived
   from the objects that count incoming and outgoing requests and
   responses.


4.4.  Document Transfer Protocol

   The MIB is based on the concept of an abstract document transfer
   protocol (DTP). The purpose of the abstract document transfer
   protocol is to make the MIB definitions independent from concrete
   protocols, like the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [19,20] or the
   File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [21].

   The abstract document transfer protocol makes the following
   assumptions about a concrete transfer protocol:

   o    The transfer protocol uses a request/response style of
        interactions.

   o    Every request contains a request type, which defines the
        operations performed by the receiving server. The request type
        is represented by an OCTET STRING. It might be necessary to
        define a translation into an OCTET STRING value for protocols
        that use numbers to identify request types.


Hazewinkel, et al.          Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


   o    A response contains a status code, which indicates if the
        request was processed successfully or which error occurred. The
        status code is represented as an INTEGER value. It might be
        necessary to define a mapping for protocols that do not use an
        INTEGER status code.

   o    A transfer protocol can send multiple responses for a single
        request.  Multiple responses are counted separately in the
        protocol statistics group.

        A primary response has to be identified for the document
        statistics. The primary response is the response that indicates
        whether the request was successful.

   Section 7 of this memo defines a mapping of the document transfer
   protocol to the HTTP protocol and the FTP protocol. Mappings to other
   protocols, like NNTP [25] or WebNFS [26,27] might be defined in the
   future.


5.  Structure of the MIB

   This section presents the structure of the MIB. The objects are
   arranged into the following groups:

   o    service information

   o    protocol statistics

   o    document statistics


5.1.  Service Information Group

   The service information group consists of a single table describing
   all the WWW services managed by the SNMP agent. The service table
   contains administrative network management information for
   (potentially) multiple WWW services running on a single host. It also
   contains information for all services within virtual domains of a
   host. The columnar objects in the table can be divided into two main
   groups:

   o    global administrative information of the service, such as
        service contact person, and

   o    network information, such as the transfer protocol.

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


5.2.  Protocol Statistics Group

   The protocol statistics group provides network management information
   about the traffic received or transmitted by a WWW service. This
   group contains counters related to DTP protocol operations and
   consists of five tables:

   o    The wwwSummaryTable contains a set of network traffic related
        counters. The table provides a summarization of the network
        traffic and protocol operations related to a WWW service. It is
        well recognized that certain variables are redundant with
        respect to the request and response tables, but they are added
        to provide an operator a quick overview and to reduce SNMP
        network traffic.

   o    The wwwRequestInTable contains detailed information about
        incoming requests. Every particular request type is counted
        separately.

   o    The wwwRequestOutTable contains detailed information about
        outgoing requests. Every particular request type is counted
        separately.

   o    The wwwResponseInTable contains detailed information about
        incoming responses. Every particular response type is counted
        separately.

   o    The wwwResponseOutTable contains detailed information about
        outgoing responses. Every particular response type is counted
        separately.


5.3.  Document Statistics Group

   The document group contains information about the documents which
   were accessed in the past. The group provides four types of
   statistics.

   1.   Details about the last N attempts to invoke actions on
        documents.

   2.   The Top N documents sorted by the number of actions invoked on
        them computed over a time interval.

   3.   The Top N documents sorted by the number of content bytes
        transferred computed over a time interval.

   4.   Summary statistics computed over a time interval.



Hazewinkel, et al.          Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


   The Top N document statistics are collected in buckets in order to
   reduce agent resources and to allow a manager to detect changes in
   the service usage pattern. Buckets are filled over a configurable
   time interval. The agent computes the Top N statistics and starts a
   new bucket once the time interval for the bucket has passed. The time
   interval is configurable for each WWW service.

   The document statistics group associates a response type to the
   request which invoked an action. In case a DTP sends multiple
   responses, the primary response must be used to derive the response
   type of the request/response interaction.

   The group consist of the following tables:

   o    The wwwDocCtrlTable provides the manager a means to limit the
        document statistic tables in size and to control the expiration
        and creation of buckets.

   o    The wwwDocLastNTable provides the manager information about the
        last N documents which where accessed. The table lists the
        documents for which access was attempted along with the request
        and response type of the DTP and a status message. The request
        and response types provide a manager information of how attempts
        to invoke actions were handled by the DTP. The status message
        object provides human readable text to further describe the
        response type.

        The number of documents in the wwwDocLastNTable is controlled by
        the wwwDocCtrlLastNSize object in the wwwDocCtrlTable. The
        wwwDocCtrlLastNLock object of the wwwDocCtrlTable allows a
        management application to lock the wwwDocLastNTable in order to
        retrieve a consistent snapshot of the fast changing
        wwwDocLastNTable.

   o    The wwwDocBucketTable lists the buckets of statistical
        information that have been collected. An entry in the
        wwwDocBucketTable contains the creation timestamp of the bucket
        as well as summary information (number of accesses, number of
        documents accessed and number of bytes transferred).

        The time interval is controlled by the
        wwwDocCtrlBucketTimeInterval object of the wwwDocCtrlTable. The
        maximum number of buckets maintained by the SNMP agent for a
        particular WWW service is controlled by the wwwDocCtrlBuckets
        object of the wwwDocCtrlTable.

   o    The wwwDocAccessTopNTable provides the manager an overview of
        the top N documents which were accessed while statistics were
        collected for a particular bucket. The wwwDocAccessTopNTable is


Hazewinkel, et al.          Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


        sorted by the number of read attempts per document. The maximum
        number of entries in the wwwDocAccessTopNTable is controlled by
        the wwwDocCtrlTopNSize object.

   o    The wwwDocBytesTopNTable provides the manager an overview of the
        top N documents which caused most of the network traffic while
        statistics were collected for a particular bucket. The
        wwwDocBytesTopNTable is sorted by the number of bytes
        transferred. The maximum number of entries in the
        wwwDocBytesTopNTable is controlled by the wwwDocCtrlTopNSize
        object.


   The Top N statistics and the parameters of the underlying bucket are
   not visible in the MIB as long as the bucket is filling up. Instead,
   the following steps must be taken when the time interval for a
   buckets has passed:


   1.   A new entry in the wwwDocBucketTable is created to summarize the
        document statistics for that time interval.

   2.   The corresponding entries in the wwwDocAccessTopNTable and the
        wwwDocBytesTopNTable are computed and made available.

   3.   If the resulting number of entries in the wwwDocBucketTable for
        the WWW service now exceeds wwwDocCtrlBuckets, then the oldest
        bucket for this WWW service and all corresponding entries in the
        wwwDocBucketTable, wwwDocAccessTopNTable, and
        wwwDocBytesTopNTable are deleted.


   Note that a bucket usually contains much more data than displayed in
   the Top N tables. The number of entries in the Top N table for a
   bucket is controlled by wwwDocCtrlTopNSize, while the number of
   entries in a bucket depends on the number of actions invoked on
   documents within the time interval over which a bucket is filled up.
   It is therefore suggested to discard the data associated with a
   bucket once the entries for the wwwDocBucketTable,
   wwwDocAccessTopNTable and wwwDocBytesTopNTable have been calculated.

7.  Document Transfer Protocol Mappings

   This section describes how existing protocols such as HTTP [19,20]
   and FTP [21] can be mapped on the abstract Document Transfer Protocol
   (DTP) used within the definitions of the WWW MIB. Every mapping must
   define the identifier which is used to uniquely identify the transfer
   protocol. In addition, the mappings must define how requests and
   responses are identified.


7.1.  The HyperText Transfer Protocol

   The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [19,20] is an application-
   level protocol used to transfer hypermedia documents in a distributed
   networked environment. HTTP is based on the request/response paradigm
   and can be mapped on the abstract DTP easily.

   The HTTP protocol usually runs over TCP and uses the well-known TCP
   port 80. Therefore, the default value for the wwwServiceProtocol
   object is { applTCPProtoID 80 }.

   HTTP allows for both requests and responses and an open-ended set of
   message types. The general message syntax of HTTP is therefore used
   for the protocol mapping. The BNF specification of the general HTTP
   message syntax as defined in [20] is as follows:

       generic-message = start-line
                         *message-header
                         CRLF
                         [ message-body ]

       start-line   = Request-Line | Status-Line


Hazewinkel, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 36]

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


       Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF

       Status-Line  = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF

   Every HTTP-message where the start-line is a Request-Line is
   considered a request in the abstract DTP. Every HTTP-message where
   the start-line is a Status-Line is considered a response in the
   abstract DTP. The mappings of WwwRequestType and WwwResponseType are
   defined as follows:

   o    The WwwRequestType corresponds to the method token in the
        Request-Line.

   o    The WwwResponseType corresponds to the Status-Code in the
        Status-Line.


7.2.  The File Transfer Protocol

   The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) [21] is an application-level
   protocol used to transfer files between hosts connected by the TCP/IP
   suite of protocols. FTP is based on a request/response paradigm and
   is mapped on the abstract DTP as defined in this section. The FTP
   model as defined in [21] is depicted below.

                                              -------------
                                              |+---------+|
                                              ||   User  ||    --------
                                              ||Interface|<--->| User |
                                              |+----|----+|    --------
                ----------                    |     |     |
                |+------+| control connection |+----|----+|
                ||Server|<------------------->||  Client ||
                ||  PI  ||  Commands/Replies  ||    PI   ||
                |+--|---+|                    |+----|----+|
                |   |    |                    |     |     |
    --------    |+--|---+|        Data        |+----|----+|    --------
    | File |<--->|Server|<------------------->||  Client |<--->| File |
    |System|    || DTP  ||     Connection     ||   DTP   ||    |System|
    --------    |+------+|                    |+---------+|    --------
                ----------                    -------------

   FTP uses two different connection types between a client and a server
   to transfer files. The control connection is persistent during a FTP
   session and used to exchange FTP commands and associated replies. The
   data connection is only available when bulk data has to be
   transferred.

   The FTP protocol usually runs over TCP and uses the well-known TCP
   port 21 to setup the control connection. Therefore, the default value


Hazewinkel, et al.          Standards Track                    [Page 37]

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


   for the wwwServiceProtocol object is { applTCPProtoID 21 }.


   Every FTP command is considered a request in the abstract DTP. Every
   FTP reply is considered a response in the abstract DTP. It should be
   noted that a single FTP command can result in multiple FTP replies
   (e.g. preliminary positive replies). The primary response for a FTP
   request contains a status code of the form 2xy, 3xy, 4xy or 5xy.  See
   section 4.2 in [21] for the exact meaning of these status codes.  The
   mappings for WwwRequestType and WwwResponseType are defined as
   follows:

   o    The WwwRequestType corresponds to the FTP command token.

   o    The WwwResponseType corresponds to the three-digit code which
        starts a reply. Multi-line replies with the same three-digit
        code are counted as a single DTP response.


8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for write operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information:

   o    The document statistics group contains traffic information
        including the names of documents that were a target of protocol
        operations. This information is sensitive as it allows to obtain
        access statistics for documents.

   o    The protocol statistics are less sensitive, because they do not
        contain details about the target of individual requests and
        responses.  However, traffic statistics and error counters still
        provide usage information about WWW services and about the
        overall quality of WWW services. It is suggested that sites
        configure MIB views so that a user of this MIB can only access
        the portion of the statistics that belong to the WWW services
        managed by that user.

   o    The service and the summary statistics groups provide
        information about the existence of WWW services and condensed
        usage statistics.  Some sites may want to protect this
        information as well, especially if they offer private WWW
        services that should not be known by the outside world.

RFC 2594                    WWW Service MIB                     May 1999


   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.


   It is recommended that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the
   User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based Access
   Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed read or write
   (change/create/delete) them.
