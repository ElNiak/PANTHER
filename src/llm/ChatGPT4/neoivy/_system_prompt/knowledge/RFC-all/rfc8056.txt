                 Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      and Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Status Mapping

Abstract

   This document describes the mapping of the Extensible Provisioning
   Protocol (EPP) statuses with the statuses registered for use in the
   Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).  This document identifies
   gaps in the mapping, and registers RDAP statuses to fill those gaps
   to ensure that all of the EPP statuses specified in RFCs are
   supported in RDAP.

1.  Introduction

   This document maps the statuses defined in the Extensible
   Provisioning Protocol (EPP) RFCs to the list of statuses registered
   for use in the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), in the "RDAP
   JSON Values" registry [rdap-json-values].

   The "RDAP JSON Values" registry is described in Section 10.2 of
   [RFC7483] and is available in the "RDAP JSON Values" registry
   [rdap-json-values].

   The EPP statuses used as the source of the mapping include
   Section 2.3 of the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Domain Name
   Mapping [RFC5731], Section 2.3 of "Extensible Provisioning Protocol
   (EPP) Host Mapping" [RFC5732], Section 2.2 of "Extensible
   Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Contact Mapping" [RFC5733], and
   Section 3.1 of "Domain Registry Grace Period Mapping for the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)" [RFC3915].

   Each EPP status MUST map to a single RDAP status to ensure that data
   in the Domain Name Registries (DNRs) that use EPP can be accurately
   presented in RDAP.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  EPP-to-RDAP Status Mapping

   Below is a list of EPP statuses from the EPP RFCs ([RFC5731],
   [RFC5732], [RFC5733], and [RFC3915]) mapped to the RDAP statuses
   registered in the "RDAP JSON Values" registry [rdap-json-values],
   with the format <EPP Status> '=' <RDAP Status>, where a blank <RDAP
   Status> indicates a gap in the mapping.

      transferPeriod =

   The "RDAP JSON Values" registry [rdap-json-values] does have a set of
   prohibited statuses including "renew prohibited", "update
   prohibited", "transfer prohibited", and "delete prohibited", but
   these statuses do not directly map to the EPP prohibited statuses.
   EPP provides status codes that allow distinguishing the case that an
   action is prohibited because of server policy from the case that an
   action is prohibited because of a client request.  The ability to
   make this distinction needs to be preserved in RDAP.

   Each of the EPP status values that don't map directly to an RDAP
   status value is described below.  Each EPP status value includes a
   proposed new RDAP status value and a description of the value.  The
   RDAP status value is derived from the EPP status value by converting
   the EPP "camelCase" representation to lowercase with a space
   character inserted between word boundaries.

   addPeriod = add period;  This grace period is provided after the
       initial registration of the object.  If the object is deleted by
       the client during this period, the server provides a credit to
       the client for the cost of the registration.

   autoRenewPeriod = auto renew period;  This grace period is provided
       after an object registration period expires and is extended
       (renewed) automatically by the server.  If the object is deleted
       by the client during this period, the server provides a credit to
       the client for the cost of the auto renewal.

   clientDeleteProhibited = client delete prohibited;  The client
       requested that requests to delete the object MUST be rejected.

   clientHold = client hold;  The client requested that the DNS
       delegation information MUST NOT be published for the object.

   clientRenewProhibited = client renew prohibited;  The client
       requested that requests to renew the object MUST be rejected.

   clientTransferProhibited = client transfer prohibited;  The client
       requested that requests to transfer the object MUST be rejected.

   clientUpdateProhibited = client update prohibited;  The client
       requested that requests to update the object (other than to
       remove this status) MUST be rejected.

   pendingRestore = pending restore;  An object is in the process of
       being restored after being in the redemption period state.

   redemptionPeriod = redemption period;  A delete has been received,
       but the object has not yet been purged because an opportunity
       exists to restore the object and abort the deletion process.

   renewPeriod = renew period;  This grace period is provided after an
       object registration period is explicitly extended (renewed) by
       the client.  If the object is deleted by the client during this
       period, the server provides a credit to the client for the cost
       of the renewal.

   serverDeleteProhibited = server delete prohibited;  The server set
       the status so that requests to delete the object MUST be
       rejected.

   serverRenewProhibited = server renew prohibited;  The server set the
       status so that requests to renew the object MUST be rejected.

   serverTransferProhibited = server transfer prohibited;  The server
       set the status so that requests to transfer the object MUST be
       rejected.

   serverUpdateProhibited = server update prohibited;  The server set
       the status so that requests to update the object (other than to
       remove this status) MUST be rejected.
   serverHold = server hold;  The server set the status so that DNS
       delegation information MUST NOT be published for the object.

   transferPeriod = transfer period;  This grace period is provided
       after the successful transfer of object registration sponsorship
       from one client to another client.  If the object is deleted by
       the client during this period, the server provides a credit to
       the client for the cost of the transfer.

   The resulting mapping after registering the new RDAP statuses is:

      addPeriod = add period
      autoRenewPeriod = auto renew period
      clientDeleteProhibited = client delete prohibited
      clientHold = client hold
      clientRenewProhibited = client renew prohibited
      clientTransferProhibited = client transfer prohibited
      clientUpdateProhibited = client update prohibited
      inactive = inactive
      linked = associated
      ok = active
      pendingCreate = pending create
      pendingDelete = pending delete
      pendingRenew = pending renew
      pendingRestore = pending restore
      pendingTransfer = pending transfer
      pendingUpdate = pending update
      redemptionPeriod = redemption period
      renewPeriod = renew period
      serverDeleteProhibited = server delete prohibited
      serverRenewProhibited = server renew prohibited
      serverTransferProhibited = server transfer prohibited
      serverUpdateProhibited = server update prohibited
      serverHold = server hold
      transferPeriod = transfer period

   The following values have been registered by the IANA in the "RDAP
   JSON Values" registry described in [RFC7483]:

      Value: add period
      Type: status
      Description: This grace period is provided after the initial
      registration of the object.  If the object is deleted by the
      client during this period, the server provides a credit to the
      client for the cost of the registration.  This maps to the Domain
      Registry Grace Period Mapping for the Extensible Provisioning

4.  Security Considerations

   The status values described in this document can be subject to
   server-side information disclosure policies that restrict display of
   the values to authorized clients.  Implementers may wish to review
   [RFC7481] for a description of the RDAP security services that can be
   used to implement information disclosure policies.
