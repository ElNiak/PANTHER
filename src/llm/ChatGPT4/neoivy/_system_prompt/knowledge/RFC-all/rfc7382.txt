RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


Preface

   This RFC contains text intended for use as a template as designated
   below by the markers <BEGIN TEMPLATE TEXT> and <END TEMPLATE TEXT>.
   Such Template Text is subject to the provisions of Section 9(b) of
   the Trust Legal Provisions.

   This document contains a template to be used for creating a
   Certification Practice Statement (CPS) for an organization that is
   part of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  (Throughout
   this document, the term "organization" is used broadly, e.g., the
   entity in question might be a business unit of a larger
   organization.)

   There is no expectation that a CPS will be published as an RFC.  An
   organization will publish the CPS in a manner appropriate for access
   by the users of the RPKI, e.g., on the organization's web site.  As a
   best current practice, organizations are expected to use this
   template instead of creating one from scratch.  This template
   contains both text that SHOULD appear in all Certification Practice
   Statements and places for text specific to the organization in
   question (indicated by <text in angle brackets>).

   The user of this document should:

   This document has been generated to complement the Certificate Policy
   (CP) for the RPKI [RFC6484].  Like RFC 6484, it is based on the
   template specified in RFC 3647 [RFC3647].  A number of sections
   contained in the template were omitted from this CPS because they did
   not apply to this PKI.  However, we have retained the section
   numbering scheme employed in that RFC to facilitate comparison with
   the section numbering scheme employed in that RFC and in RFC 6484.

<BEGIN TEMPLATE TEXT>

   <Create a title page saying, e.g., "<Name of organization>
   Certification Practice Statement for the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI)" with date, author, etc.>

   <Create a table of contents.>

1.  Introduction

   This document is the Certification Practice Statement (CPS) of <name
   of organization>.  It describes the practices employed by the <name
   of organization> Certification Authority (CA) in the Resource Public
   Key Infrastructure (RPKI).  These practices are defined in accordance
   with the requirements of the Certificate Policy (CP) [RFC6484] for
   the RPKI.

   The RPKI is designed to support validation of claims by current
   holders of Internet Number Resources (INRs) (Section 1.6) in
   accordance with the records of the organizations that act as CAs in
   this PKI.  The ability to verify such claims is essential to ensuring
   the unique, unambiguous distribution of these resources.

   This PKI parallels the existing INR distribution hierarchy.  These
   resources are distributed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
   (IANA) to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).  In some regions,
   National Internet Registries (NIRs) form a tier of the hierarchy
   below the RIRs for INR distribution.  Internet Service Providers
   (ISPs) and network subscribers form additional tiers below
   registries.

   Conventions Used in This Document:

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.1.  Overview

   This CPS describes:

   o  Participants

   o  Publication of the certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists
      (CRLs)

   o  How certificates are issued, managed, re-keyed, renewed, and
      revoked

   o  Facility management (physical security, personnel, audit, etc.)

   o  Key management

   o  Audit procedures

   o  Business and legal issues

   This PKI encompasses several types of certificates (see [RFC6480] for
   more details):

   o  CA certificates for each organization distributing INRs and for
      each subscriber INR holder.

   o  End-entity (EE) certificates for organizations to use to validate
      digital signatures on RPKI-signed objects (see definition in
      Section 1.6).

   o  In the future, the PKI also may include end-entity certificates in
      support of access control for the repository system as described
      in Section 2.4.

1.2.  Document Name and Identification

   The name of this document is "<Name of organization> Certification
   Practice Statement for the Resource Public Key Infrastructure
   (RPKI)".  <If this document is available via the Internet, the CA can
   provide the URI for the CPS here.  It SHOULD be the same URI as the
   URI that appears as a policy qualifier in the CA certificate for the
   CA, if the CA elects to make use of that feature.>

1.3.  PKI Participants

   Note that in a PKI the term "subscriber" refers to an individual or
   organization that is a subject of a certificate issued by a CA.  The
   term is used in this fashion throughout this document, without
   qualification, and should not be confused with the networking use of
   the term to refer to an individual or organization that receives
   service from an ISP.  In such cases, the term "network subscriber"
   will be used.  Also note that, for brevity, this document always
   refers to PKI participants as organizations or entities, even though
   some of them are individuals.

1.3.1.  Certification Authorities

   <Describe the CAs that you will operate for the RPKI.  One approach
   is to operate two CAs: one designated "offline" and the other
   designated "production".  The offline CA is the top-level CA for the
   <name of organization> portion of the RPKI.  It provides a secure
   revocation and recovery capability in case the production CA is
   compromised or becomes unavailable.  Thus, the offline CA issues
   certificates only to instances of the production CA, and the CRLs it
   issues are used to revoke only certificates issued to the production
   CA.  The production CA is used to issue RPKI certificates to <name of
   organization> members, to whom INRs have been distributed.>

1.3.2.  Registration Authorities

   <Describe how the Registration Authority (RA) function is handled for
   the CA(s) that you operate.  The RPKI does not require establishment
   or use of a separate Registration Authority in addition to the CA
   function.  The RA function MUST be provided by the same entity
   operating as a CA, e.g., entities listed in Section 1.3.1.  An entity
   acting as a CA in this PKI already has a formal relationship with
   each organization to which it distributes INRs.  These organizations
   already perform the RA function implicitly, since they already assume
   responsibility for distributing INRs.>

1.3.3.  Subscribers

   Organizations receiving INR allocations from this CA are subscribers
   in the RPKI.

1.3.4.  Relying Parties

   Entities or individuals that act in reliance on certificates or
   RPKI-signed objects issued under this PKI are relying parties.
   Relying parties may or may not be subscribers within this PKI.
   (See Section 1.6 for the definition of an RPKI-signed object.)

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


1.3.5.  Other Participants

   <Specify one or more entities that operate a repository holding
   certificates, CRLs, and other RPKI-signed objects issued by this
   organization, and provide a URL for the repository.>

1.4.  Certificate Usage

1.4.1.  Appropriate Certificate Uses

   The certificates issued under this hierarchy are for authorization in
   support of validation of claims of current holdings of INRs.

   Additional uses of the certificates, consistent with the basic goal
   cited above, are also permitted under RFC 6484.

   Some of the certificates that may be issued under this PKI could be
   used to support operation of this infrastructure, e.g., access
   control for the repository system as described in Section 2.4.  Such
   uses also are permitted under the RPKI certificate policy.

1.4.2.  Prohibited Certificate Uses

   Any uses other than those described in Section 1.4.1 are prohibited.

1.5.  Policy Administration

1.5.1.  Organization Administering the Document

   This CPS is administered by <name of organization>.  <Include the
   mailing address, email address, and similar contact info here.>

1.5.2.  Contact Person

   <Insert organization contact info here.>

1.5.3.  Person Determining CPS Suitability for the Policy

   Not applicable.  Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI
   is attesting to the distribution of INRs to the holder of the private
   key corresponding to the public key in the certificate.  The issuing
   organizations are the same organizations as the ones that perform the
   distribution; hence, they are authoritative with respect to the
   accuracy of this binding.

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


1.5.4.  CPS Approval Procedures

   Not applicable.  Each organization issuing a certificate in this PKI
   is attesting to the distribution of INRs to the holder of the private
   key corresponding to the public key in the certificate.  The issuing
   organizations are the same organizations as the ones that perform the
   distribution; hence, they are authoritative with respect to the
   accuracy of this binding.

1.6.  Definitions and Acronyms

   BPKI   Business PKI.  A BPKI is an optional additional PKI used by an
          organization to identify members to whom RPKI certificates can
          be issued.  If a BPKI is employed by a CA, it may have its own
          CP, separate from the RPKI CP.

   CP     Certificate Policy.  A CP is a named set of rules that
          indicates the applicability of a certificate to a particular
          community and/or class of applications with common security
          requirements.  The CP for the RPKI is [RFC6484].

   CPS    Certification Practice Statement.  A CPS is a document that
          specifies the practices that a Certification Authority employs
          in issuing certificates.

   Distribution of INRs   A process of distribution of the INRs along
          the respective number hierarchy.  IANA distributes blocks of
          IP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) to the five
          Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).  RIRs distribute smaller
          address blocks and Autonomous System Numbers to organizations
          within their service regions, who in turn distribute IP
          addresses to their customers.

   IANA   Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.  IANA is responsible for
          global coordination of the Internet Protocol addressing
          systems and ASNs used for routing Internet traffic.  IANA
          distributes INRs to RIRs.

   INRs   Internet Number Resources.  INRs are number values for three
          protocol parameter sets, namely:

          o  IP version 4 addresses,

          o  IP version 6 addresses, and

          o  Identifiers used in Internet inter-domain routing,
             currently Border Gateway Protocol-4 ASNs.

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


   ISP    Internet Service Provider.  An ISP is an organization managing
          and selling Internet services to other organizations.

   NIR    National Internet Registry.  An NIR is an organization that
          manages the distribution of INRs for a portion of the
          geopolitical area covered by a Regional Internet Registry.
          NIRs form an optional second tier in the tree scheme used to
          manage INR distribution.

   RIR    Regional Internet Registry.  An RIR is an organization that
          manages the distribution of INRs for a geopolitical area.

   RPKI-signed object   An RPKI-signed object is a digitally signed data
          object (other than a certificate or CRL) declared to be such
          an object by a Standards Track RFC.  An RPKI-signed object can
          be validated using certificates issued under this PKI.  The
          content and format of these data constructs depend on the
          context in which validation of claims of current holdings of
          INRs takes place.  Examples of these objects are repository
          manifests [RFC6486] and Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs)
          [RFC6482].

2.  Publication and Repository Responsibilities

2.1.  Repositories

   As per the CP, certificates, CRLs, and RPKI-signed objects MUST be
   made available for downloading by all relying parties, to enable them
   to validate this data.

   The <name of organization> RPKI CA will publish certificates, CRLs,
   and RPKI-signed objects via a repository that is accessible via
   <insert IETF-designated protocol name here> at <insert URL here>.
   This repository will conform to the structure described in [RFC6481].

2.2.  Publication of Certification Information

   <Name of organization> will publish certificates, CRLs, and
   RPKI-signed objects issued by it to a repository that operates as
   part of a worldwide distributed system of RPKI repositories.

2.3.  Time or Frequency of Publication

   <Describe here your procedures for publication (to the global
   repository system) of the certificates, CRLs, and RPKI-signed objects
   that you issue.  If you choose to outsource publication of PKI data,
   you still need to provide this information for relying parties.  This
   MUST include the period of time within which a certificate will be



Kent, et al.              Best Current Practice                [Page 14]

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


   published after the CA issues the certificate, and the period of time
   within which a CA will publish a CRL with an entry for a revoked
   certificate, after the CA revokes that certificate.>

   The <name of organization> CA will publish its CRL prior to the
   nextUpdate value in the scheduled CRL previously issued by the CA.

2.4.  Access Controls on Repositories

   <Describe the access controls used by the organization to ensure that
   only authorized parties can modify repository data, and any controls
   used to mitigate denial-of-service attacks against the repository.
   If the organization offers repository services to its subscribers,
   then describe here the protocol(s) that it supports for publishing
   signed objects from subscribers.>

3.  Identification and Authentication

3.1.  Naming

3.1.1.  Types of Names

   The subject of each certificate issued by this organization is
   identified by an X.500 Distinguished Name (DN).  The distinguished
   name will consist of a single Common Name (CN) attribute with a value
   generated by <name of organization>.  Optionally, the serialNumber
   attribute may be included along with the common name (to form a
   terminal relative distinguished name set), to distinguish among
   successive instances of certificates associated with the same entity.

3.1.2.  Need for Names to Be Meaningful

   The Subject name in each certificate SHOULD NOT be "meaningful", in
   the conventional, human-readable sense.  The rationale here is that
   these certificates are used for authorization in support of
   applications that make use of attestations of INR holdings.  They are
   not used to identify subjects.

3.1.3.  Anonymity or Pseudonymity of Subscribers

   Although Subject names in certificates issued by this organization
   SHOULD NOT be meaningful and may appear "random", anonymity is not a
   function of this PKI; thus, no explicit support for this feature is
   provided.

3.1.4.  Rules for Interpreting Various Name Forms

   None



Kent, et al.              Best Current Practice                [Page 15]

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


3.1.5.  Uniqueness of Names

   <Name of organization> certifies Subject names that are unique among
   the certificates that it issues.  Although it is desirable that these
   Subject names be unique throughout the PKI, to facilitate certificate
   path discovery, such uniqueness is not required, nor is it enforced
   through technical means.  <Name of organization> generates Subject
   names to minimize the chances that two entities in the RPKI will be
   assigned the same name.  Specifically, <insert Subject name
   generation description here, or cite RFC 6487>.

3.1.6.  Recognition, Authentication, and Role of Trademarks

   Because the Subject names are not intended to be meaningful, <name of
   organization> makes no provision either to recognize or to
   authenticate trademarks, service marks, etc.

3.2.  Initial Identity Validation

3.2.1.  Method to Prove Possession of Private Key

   <Describe the method whereby each subscriber will be required to
   demonstrate proof-of-possession (PoP) of the private key
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate, prior to
   certificate issuance.>

3.2.2.  Authentication of Organization Identity

   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the
   organizational identity of subscribers.  However, certificates are
   issued to subscribers in a fashion that preserves the accuracy of
   distributions of INRs as represented in <name of organization>
   records.

   <Describe the procedures that will be used to ensure that each RPKI
   certificate that is issued accurately reflects your records with
   regard to the organization to which you have distributed (or
   sub-distributed) the INRs identified in the certificate.  For
   example, a BPKI certificate could be used to authenticate a
   certificate request that serves as a link to the <name of
   organization> subscriber database that maintains the INR distribution
   records.  The certificate request could be matched against the
   database record for the subscriber in question, and an RPKI
   certificate would be issued only if the INRs requested were a subset
   of those held by the subscriber.  The specific procedures employed
   for this purpose should be commensurate with any you already employ
   in the maintenance of INR distribution.>




Kent, et al.              Best Current Practice                [Page 16]

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


3.2.3.  Authentication of Individual Identity

   Certificates issued under this PKI do not attest to the individual
   identity of a subscriber.  However, <name of organization> maintains
   contact information for each subscriber in support of certificate
   renewal, re-key, and revocation.

   <Describe the procedures that are used to identify at least one
   individual as a representative of each subscriber.  This is done in
   support of issuance, renewal, and revocation of the certificate
   issued to the organization.  For example, one might say "The <name of
   organization> BPKI (see Section 3.2.6) issues certificates that MUST
   be used to identify individuals who represent <name of organization>
   subscribers."  The procedures should be commensurate with those you
   already employ in authenticating individuals as representatives for
   INR holders.  Note that this authentication is solely for use by you
   in dealing with the organizations to which you distribute (or
   sub-distribute) INRs and thus MUST NOT be relied upon outside of this
   CA/subscriber relationship.>

3.2.4.  Non-verified Subscriber Information

   No non-verified subscriber data is included in certificates issued
   under this certificate policy except for Subject Information Access
   (SIA) extensions [RFC6487].

3.2.5.  Validation of Authority

   <Describe the procedures used to verify that an individual claiming
   to represent a subscriber is authorized to represent that subscriber
   in this context.  For example, one could say "Only an individual to
   whom a BPKI certificate (see Section 3.2.6) has been issued may
   request issuance of an RPKI certificate.  Each certificate issuance
   request is verified using the BPKI."  The procedures should be
   commensurate with those you already employ in authenticating
   individuals as representatives of subscribers.>

3.2.6.  Criteria for Interoperation

   The RPKI is neither intended nor designed to interoperate with any
   other PKI.  <If you operate a separate, additional PKI for business
   purposes, e.g., a BPKI, then describe (or reference) how the BPKI is
   used to authenticate subscribers and to enable them to manage their
   resource distributions.>

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


3.3.  Identification and Authentication for Re-key Requests

3.3.1.  Identification and Authentication for Routine Re-key

   <Describe the conditions under which routine re-key is required and
   the manner by which it is requested.  Describe the procedures that
   are used to ensure that a subscriber requesting routine re-key is the
   legitimate holder of the certificate to be re-keyed.  State the
   approach for establishing PoP of the private key corresponding to the
   new public key.  If you operate a BPKI, describe how that BPKI is
   used to authenticate routine re-key requests.>

3.3.2.  Identification and Authentication for Re-key after Revocation

   <Describe the procedures used to ensure that an organization
   requesting a re-key after revocation is the legitimate holder of the
   INRs in the certificate being re-keyed.  This MUST also include the
   method employed for verifying PoP of the private key corresponding to
   the new public key.  If you operate a BPKI, describe how that BPKI is
   used to authenticate re-key requests.  With respect to authentication
   of the subscriber, the procedures should be commensurate with those
   you already employ in the maintenance of INR distribution records.>

3.4.  Identification and Authentication for Revocation Request

   <Describe the procedures used by an RPKI subscriber to make a
   revocation request.  Describe the manner by which it is ensured that
   the subscriber requesting revocation is the subject of the
   certificate (or an authorized representative thereof) to be revoked.
   Note that there may be different procedures for the case where the
   legitimate subject still possesses the original private key as
   opposed to the case when it no longer has access to that key.  These
   procedures should be commensurate with those you already employ in
   the maintenance of subscriber records.>

4.  Certificate Life Cycle Operational Requirements

4.1.  Certificate Application

4.1.1.  Who Can Submit a Certificate Application

   Any subscriber in good standing who holds INRs distributed by <name
   of organization> may submit a certificate application to this CA.
   (The exact meaning of "in good standing" is in accordance with the
   policy of <name of organization>.)

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


4.1.2.  Enrollment Process and Responsibilities

   <Describe your enrollment process for issuing certificates both for
   initial deployment of the PKI and as an ongoing process.  Note that
   most of the certificates in this PKI are issued as part of your
   normal business practices, as an adjunct to INR distribution, and
   thus a separate application to request a certificate may not be
   necessary.  If so, reference should be made to where these practices
   are documented.>

4.2.  Certificate Application Processing

   <Describe the certificate request/response processing that you will
   employ.  You should make use of existing standards for certificate
   application processing (see [RFC6487]).>

4.2.1.  Performing Identification and Authentication Functions

   <Describe your practices for identification and authentication of
   certificate applicants.  Often, existing practices employed by you to
   identify and authenticate organizations can be used as the basis for
   issuance of certificates to these subscribers.  Reference can be made
   to documentation of such existing practices.>

4.2.2.  Approval or Rejection of Certificate Applications

   <Describe your practices for approval or rejection of applications,
   and refer to documentation of existing business practices relevant to
   this process.  Note that according to the CP, certificate
   applications will be approved based on the normal business practices
   of the entity operating the CA, based on the CA's records of
   subscribers.  The CP also says that each CA will follow the procedure
   specified in Section 3.2.1 to verify that the requester holds the
   private key corresponding to the public key that will be bound to the
   certificate the CA issues to the requester.>

4.2.3.  Time to Process Certificate Applications

   <Specify here your expected time frame for processing certificate
   applications.>

4.3.  Certificate Issuance

4.3.1.  CA Actions during Certificate Issuance

   <Describe your procedures for issuance and publication of a
   certificate.>

4.3.2.  Notification to Subscriber by the CA of Issuance of Certificate

   <Name of organization> will notify the subscriber when the
   certificate is published.  <Describe here your procedures for
   notifying a subscriber when a certificate has been published.>

4.3.3.  Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

   <Describe here any other entities that will be notified when a
   certificate is published.>

4.4.  Certificate Acceptance

4.4.1.  Conduct Constituting Certificate Acceptance

   When a certificate is issued, the <name of organization> CA will
   publish it to the repository and notify the subscriber.  <This may be
   done without subscriber review and acceptance.  State your policy
   with respect to subscriber certificate acceptance here.>

4.4.2.  Publication of the Certificate by the CA

   Certificates will be published at <insert repository URL here> once
   issued, following the conduct described in Section 4.4.1.  This will
   be done within <specify the time frame within which the certificate
   will be placed in the repository and the subscriber will be
   notified>.  <Describe any additional procedures with respect to
   publication of the certificate here.>

4.4.3.  Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

   <Describe here any other entities that will be notified when a
   certificate is published.>

4.5.  Key Pair and Certificate Usage

   A summary of the use model for the RPKI is provided below.

4.5.1.  Subscriber Private Key and Certificate Usage

   The certificates issued by <name of organization> to subordinate INR
   holders are CA certificates.  The private key associated with each of
   these certificates is used to sign subordinate (CA or EE)
   certificates and CRLs.

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


4.5.2.  Relying Party Public Key and Certificate Usage

   The primary relying parties in this PKI are organizations that use
   RPKI EE certificates to verify RPKI-signed objects.  Relying parties
   are referred to Section 4.5.2 of [RFC6484] for additional guidance
   with respect to acts of reliance on RPKI certificates.

4.6.  Certificate Renewal

4.6.1.  Circumstance for Certificate Renewal

   As per RFC 6484, a certificate will be processed for renewal based on
   its expiration date or a renewal request from the certificate
   Subject.  The request may be implicit, a side effect of renewing a
   resource holding agreement, or explicit.  If <name of organization>
   initiates the renewal process based on the certificate expiration
   date, then <name of organization> will notify the subscriber <insert
   the period of advance warning, e.g., "2 weeks in advance of the
   expiration date", or the general policy, e.g., "in conjunction with
   notification of service expiration">.  The validity interval of the
   new (renewed) certificate will overlap that of the previous
   certificate by <insert length of overlap period, e.g., 1 week>, to
   ensure uninterrupted coverage.

   Certificate renewal will incorporate the same public key as the
   previous certificate, unless the private key has been reported as
   compromised (see Section 4.9.1).  If a new key pair is being used,
   the stipulations of Section 4.7 will apply.

4.6.2.  Who May Request Renewal

   The subscriber or <name of organization> may initiate the renewal
   process.  <For the case of the subscriber, describe the procedures
   that will be used to ensure that the requester is the legitimate
   holder of the INRs in the certificate being renewed.  This MUST also
   include the method employed for verifying PoP of the private key
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate being renewed or
   the new public key if the public key is being changed.  With respect
   to authentication of the subscriber, the procedures should be
   commensurate with those you already employ in the maintenance of INR
   distribution records.  If you operate a BPKI for this, describe how
   that business-based PKI is used to authenticate renewal requests, and
   refer to Section 3.2.6.>

4.6.3.  Processing Certificate Renewal Requests

   <Describe your procedures for handling certificate renewal requests.
   Describe how you verify that the requester is the subscriber or is
   authorized by the subscriber, and that the certificate in question
   has not been revoked.>

4.6.4.  Notification of New Certificate Issuance to Subscriber

   <Name of organization> will notify the subscriber when the
   certificate is published.  <Describe your procedure for notification
   of new certificate issuance to the subscriber.  This should be
   consistent with Section 4.3.2.>

4.6.5.  Conduct Constituting Acceptance of a Renewal Certificate

   See Section 4.4.1.  <If you employ a different policy from that
   specified in Section 4.4.1, describe it here.>

4.6.6.  Publication of the Renewal Certificate by the CA

   See Section 4.4.2.

4.6.7.  Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

   See Section 4.4.3.

4.7.  Certificate Re-key

4.7.1.  Circumstance for Certificate Re-key

   As per RFC 6484, re-key of a certificate will be performed only when
   required, based on:

   1. knowledge or suspicion of compromise or loss of the associated
      private key, or

   2. the expiration of the cryptographic lifetime of the associated key
      pair

   If a certificate is revoked to replace the RFC 3779 extensions, the
   replacement certificate will incorporate the same public key, not a
   new key.

   If the re-key is based on a suspected compromise, then the previous
   certificate will be revoked.

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


4.7.2.  Who May Request Certification of a New Public Key

   Only the holder of a certificate may request a re-key.  In addition,
   <name of organization> may initiate a re-key based on a verified
   compromise report.  <If the subscriber (certificate Subject) requests
   the re-key, describe how authentication is effected, e.g., using the
   <name of registry> BPKI.  Describe how a compromise report received
   from other than a subscriber is verified.>

4.7.3.  Processing Certificate Re-keying Requests

   <Describe your process for handling re-keying requests.  As per the
   RPKI CP, this should be consistent with the process described in
   Section 4.3, so reference can be made to that section.>

4.7.4.  Notification of New Certificate Issuance to Subscriber

   <Describe your policy for notifying the subscriber regarding
   availability of the new re-keyed certificate.  This should be
   consistent with the notification process for any new certificate
   issuance (see Section 4.3.2).>

4.7.5.  Conduct Constituting Acceptance of a Re-keyed Certificate

   When a re-keyed certificate is issued, the CA will publish it in the
   repository and notify the subscriber.  See Section 4.4.1.

4.7.6.  Publication of the Re-keyed Certificate by the CA

   <Describe your policy regarding publication of the new certificate.
   This should be consistent with the publication process for any new
   certificate (see Section 4.4.2).>

4.7.7.  Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

   See Section 4.4.3.

4.8.  Certificate Modification

4.8.1.  Circumstance for Certificate Modification

   As per RFC 6484, modification of a certificate occurs to implement
   changes to the RFC 3779 extension values or the SIA extension in a
   certificate.  A subscriber can request a certificate modification
   when this information in a currently valid certificate has changed,
   as a result of changes in the INR holdings of the subscriber, or as a
   result of change of the repository publication point data.

RFC 7382                Template CPS for the RPKI             April 2015


   If a subscriber is to receive a distribution of INRs in addition to a
   current distribution, and if the subscriber does not request that a
   new certificate be issued containing only these additional INRs, then
   this is accomplished through a certificate modification.  When a
   certificate modification is approved, a new certificate is issued.
   The new certificate will contain the same public key and the same
   expiration date as the original certificate, but with the incidental
   information corrected and/or the INR distribution expanded.  When
   previously distributed INRs are to be removed from a certificate,
   then the old certificate will be revoked and a new certificate
   (reflecting the new distribution) issued.

4.8.2.  Who May Request Certificate Modification

   The subscriber or <name of organization> may initiate the certificate
   modification process.  <For the case of the subscriber, state here
   what steps will be taken to verify the identity and authorization of
   the entity requesting the modification.>

4.8.3.  Processing Certificate Modification Requests

   <Describe your procedures for verification of the modification
   request and procedures for the issuance of a new certificate.  These
   should be consistent with the processes described in Sections 4.2
   and 4.3.1.>

4.8.4.  Notification of Modified Certificate Issuance to Subscriber

   <Describe your procedure for notifying the subscriber about the
   issuance of a modified certificate.  This should be consistent
   with the notification process for any new certificate (see
   Section 4.3.2).>

4.8.5.  Conduct Constituting Acceptance of Modified Certificate

   When a modified certificate is issued, <name of organization> will
   publish it to the repository and notify the subscriber.  See
   Section 4.4.1.

4.8.6.  Publication of the Modified Certificate by the CA

   <Describe your procedure for publication of a modified certificate.
   This should be consistent with the publication process for any new
   certificate (see Section 4.4.2).>

4.8.7.  Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

   See Section 4.4.3.

4.9.  Certificate Revocation and Suspension

4.9.1.  Circumstances for Revocation

   As per RFC 6484, certificates can be revoked for several reasons.
   Either <name of organization> or the subject may choose to end the
   relationship expressed in the certificate, thus creating cause to
   revoke the certificate.  If one or more of the INRs bound to the
   public key in the certificate are no longer associated with the
   subject, that too constitutes a basis for revocation.  A certificate
   also may be revoked due to loss or compromise of the private key
   corresponding to the public key in the certificate.  Finally, a
   certificate may be revoked in order to invalidate data signed by the
   private key associated with that certificate.

4.9.2.  Who Can Request Revocation

   The subscriber or <name of organization> may request a revocation.
   <For the case of the subscriber, describe what steps will be taken to
   verify the identity and authorization of the entity requesting the
   revocation.>

4.9.3.  Procedure for Revocation Request

   <Describe your process for handling a certificate revocation request.
   This should include:

   o  Procedure to be used by the subscriber to request a revocation.

   o  Procedure for notification of the subscriber when the revocation
      is initiated by <name of organization>.>

4.9.4.  Revocation Request Grace Period

   A subscriber is required to request revocation as soon as possible
   after the need for revocation has been identified.

4.9.5.  Time within Which CA Must Process the Revocation Request

   <Describe your policy on the time period within which you will
   process a revocation request.>

4.9.6.  Revocation Checking Requirement for Relying Parties

   As per RFC 6484, a relying party is responsible for acquiring and
   checking the most recent, scheduled CRL from the issuer of the
   certificate, whenever the relying party validates a certificate.

4.9.7.  CRL Issuance Frequency

   <State the CRL issuance frequency for the CRLs that you publish.>
   Each CRL contains a nextUpdate value, and a new CRL will be published
   at or before that time.  <Name of organization> will set the
   nextUpdate value when it issues a CRL, to signal when the next
   scheduled CRL will be issued.

4.9.8.  Maximum Latency for CRLs

   A CRL will be published to the repository system within <state the
   maximum latency> after generation.

10.  Security Considerations

   The degree to which a relying party can trust the binding embodied in
   a certificate depends on several factors.  These factors can include

   o  the practices followed by the Certification Authority (CA) in
      authenticating the subject

   o  the CA's operating policy, procedures, and technical security
      controls, including the scope of the subscriber's responsibilities
      (for example, in protecting the private key)

   o  the stated responsibilities and liability terms and conditions of
      the CA (for example, warranties, disclaimers of warranties, and
      limitations of liability)

   This document provides a framework to address the technical,
   procedural, personnel, and physical security aspects of Certification
   Authorities, Registration Authorities, repositories, subscribers, and
   relying party cryptographic modules, in order to ensure that the
   certificate generation, publication, renewal, re-key, usage, and
   revocation are done in a secure manner.  Specifically, the following
   sections are oriented towards ensuring the secure operation of the
   PKI entities such as CA, RA, repository, subscriber systems, and
   relying party systems:

      Section 3 ("Identification and Authentication" (I&A))
      Section 4 ("Certificate Life Cycle Operational Requirements")
      Section 5 ("Facility, Management, and Operational Controls")
      Section 6 ("Technical Security Controls")
      Section 7 ("Certificate and CRL Profiles")
      Section 8 ("Compliance Audit and Other Assessments")
