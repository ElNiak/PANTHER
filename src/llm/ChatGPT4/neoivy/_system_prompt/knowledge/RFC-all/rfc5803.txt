 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Schema for Storing Salted
      Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) Secrets

Abstract

   This memo describes how the "authPassword" Lightweight Directory
   Access Protocol (LDAP) attribute can be used for storing secrets used
   by the Salted Challenge Response Authentication Message (SCRAM)
   mechanism in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
   framework.

1.  Overview

   This document describes how the authPassword LDAP attribute
   [AUTHPASS] can be used for storing secrets used by [SCRAM] Simple
   Authentication and Security Layer [RFC4422] Mechanisms.

      The "scheme" part of the authPassword attribute is the SCRAM
      mechanism name (always without the "-PLUS" suffix), e.g., "SCRAM-
      SHA-1".  See [SCRAM] for the exact syntax of SCRAM mechanism
      names.

      The "authInfo" part of the authPassword attribute is the iteration
      count (iter-count in the ABNF below), followed by ":" and base64-
      encoded [BASE64] salt.

      The "authValue" part of the authPassword attribute is the base64-
      encoded [BASE64] StoredKey [SCRAM], followed by ":" and base64-
      encoded [BASE64] ServerKey [SCRAM].

   Syntax of the attribute can be expressed using ABNF [RFC5234].  Non-
   terminal references in the following ABNF are defined in either
   [AUTHPASS], [RFC4422], or [RFC5234].

       scram-mech     = "SCRAM-SHA-1" / scram-mech-ext
                      ; Complies with ABNF for <scheme>
                      ; defined in [AUTHPASS].

       scram-authInfo = iter-count ":" salt
                      ; Complies with ABNF for <authInfo>
                      ; defined in [AUTHPASS].

       scram-authValue = stored-key ":" server-key
                      ; Complies with ABNF for <authValue>
                      ; defined in [AUTHPASS].

       iter-count   = %x31-39 *DIGIT
                      ; SCRAM iteration count.
                      ; A positive number without leading zeros.

       salt         = <base64-encoded value>

       stored-key   = <base64-encoded value>
                      ; See definition in [SCRAM].

       server-key   = <base64-encoded value>
                      ; See definition in [SCRAM].

       scram-mech-ext = "SCRAM-" 1*9mech-char
                      ; Other SCRAM mechanisms registered
                      ; in the IANA registry for SASL
                      ; mechanism names.

       mech-char    = <Defined in RFC 4422>

   Note that the authPassword attribute is multivalued.  For example, it
   may contain multiple SCRAM hashes for different hashing algorithms.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document defines how the authPassword attribute can be used to
   store SCRAM secrets.  Therefore, security considerations relevant to
   [SCRAM] and hash functions used with it are also relevant to this
   document.

   General security considerations related to the authPassword attribute
   (as specified in [AUTHPASS]) also apply to the use of authPassword as
   specified in this document.  In particular, the values of
   authPassword SHOULD be protected as if they were cleartext passwords.
   A read operation on this attribute that is not protected by a privacy
   layer (such as IPsec or TLS) can expose this attribute to an attacker
   who a) would be able to use the intercepted value to impersonate the
   user to all servers providing SCRAM access using the same hash
   function, password, iteration count, and salt or b) would be able to
   perform an offline dictionary or brute-force attack in order to
   recover the user's password.

   Servers MUST validate the format of the authPassword attribute before
   using it for performing a SCRAM authentication exchange.  It is
   possible that an attacker compromised the LDAP server or got access
   to the entry containing the attribute in order to exploit a
   vulnerability in the subsystem performing the SCRAM authentication

   exchange.  Big iteration counts and invalid base64 encoding are two
   possible (but not the only) exploits in the format specified in the
   document.
