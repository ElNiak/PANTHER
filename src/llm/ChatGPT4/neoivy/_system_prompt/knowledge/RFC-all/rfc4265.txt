1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines Textual Conventions used in Virtual Private
   Networks (VPNs) and IETF VPN-related MIBs.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  VPN-TC-STD-MIB

3.1.  Description

   The VPN-TC-STD-MIB defines a Textual Convention for the Global VPN
   Identifier, or VPN-ID, as specified in [RFC2685].  The purpose of a
   VPN-ID is to uniquely identify a VPN.  It MUST be 7 octets in length,
   and SHOULD be comprised of a 3 octet Organizationally Unique
   Identifier (OUI) that uniquely identifies the VPN Authority, followed
   by a 4 octet value assigned by the VPN Authority that uniquely
   identifies the VPN within the context of the OUI.

       DESCRIPTION
           "The purpose of a VPN-ID is to uniquely identify a VPN.
            The Global VPN Identifier format is:
            3 octet VPN Authority, Organizationally Unique Identifier
            followed by 4 octet VPN index identifying VPN according
            to OUI"

   VPNIdOrZero ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS            current
       DESCRIPTION
           "This textual convention is an extension of the
            VPNId textual convention that defines a non-zero-length
            OCTET STRING to identify a physical entity.  This extension
            permits the additional value of a zero-length OCTET STRING.

RFC 4265                     VPN-TC-STD-MIB                November 2005


            The semantics of the value zero-length OCTET STRING are
            object-specific and must therefore be defined
            as part of the description of any object that uses this
            syntax.  Examples of usage of this extension are
            situations where none or all VPN IDs need to be
            referenced."
       SYNTAX    OCTET STRING (SIZE (0 | 7))

   END

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions that may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  Therefore, this document has
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations for VPN-TC-STD-MIB

   The IANA has assigned { mib-2 129 } to the VPN-TC-STD-MIB module
   specified in this document.
