RFC 3055                        PINT MIB                   February 2001


1. Introduction

   PINT services are an emerging set of new Internet based applications
   where voice (and fax) requests to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone
   Network) are carried over the Internet.  RFC 2458 [1] gives a good
   introduction to the (pre-standard) PINT architecture and services.
   It also has examples of some of the early implementations of pre-
   PINT.

   This document defines a MIB which contains the elements for
   monitoring the performance of a PINT based service.  The MIB consists
   of details of the four basic PINT services and their performance
   statistics measured under various criteria.

   It is not the purpose of this MIB to enable management of the PINT
   networking elements.  We are concerned only with the PINT specific
   performance parameters.  While it is understood that PINT service
   performance is closely related to host and network performance, they
   are not addressed here.

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
        RFC 2578 [6], RFC 2579 [7] and RFC 2580 [8].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and
        RFC 1906 [11].  The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and
        RFC 2574 [13].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [14].

RFC 3055                        PINT MIB                   February 2001


    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [16].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3. The need for PINT services monitoring MIB

   Traditionally voice (and fax) requests originate and terminate inside
   a PSTN network.  This network is well known for robust handling of
   the requests, in terms of availability and security.  However when
   the requests originate from the Internet there is a concern both on
   the part of the user as well as the provider about issues like
   reliable forwarding of the call requests to the PINT gateway under
   various network conditions, user/host authentication, secure handling
   of the user information etc.  Performance and security management
   becomes all the more important where PINT services cross multiple
   administrative domains (or providers).

   This MIB is an attempt to list the parameters that need to be
   monitored on an user, PINT client, PINT server and PINT gateway
   basis.

   (PINT services, their invocation methods/protocols and security
   issues associated with the PINT architecture are discussed in detail
   in [18]).

4. PINT MIB - Overview

   Following is a list of some explanations on the MIB definitions that
   we have chosen to construct.

    o   The basic purpose of this MIB is to monitor the access to PINT
        services both from the performance and security point of view.
        Information may pertain to a certain user or his/her system
        (PINT client) or the system providing the PINT services (PINT
        server) or the PINT gateway that forwards the call to the PSTN
        network.

    o   We chose to build the configuration table as an extension of the
        Application MIB - RFC 2287 [19] using the augments construct.
        Server location and contact might be retrieved from the standard
        MIB-II sysLocation and sysContact objects.  There is no need to
        replicate this information in the PINT MIB.  However, the PINT
        administrator may be a different person than the sysadmin with
        global responsibilities, thus a pintSysContact object is
        defined.

    o   We chose to monitor the gateway connections from the PINT
        server.  While the agent runs in the PINT servers, the
        connections to the gateways might need to be monitored in order
        to understand what goes on.  We placed them in a separate MIB
        group, and by using MODULE-COMPLIANCE clauses, agents that
        cannot implement this stuff will not be mandated to do it.

    o   There is no traps definition in this MIB module.  Note that
        thresholding on counters is always possible by using a standard
        mechanism defined by the Remote Monitoring MIB, that can be
        referenced here.  Some events that may be defined by using this
        mechanisms:

            *  continuous login/authentication failure or refusal from a
               particular client or user

            *  nuisance call - repeated calls (within a specified
               period) to a number originating from the same user

    o   The client performance and user performance tables may be rather
        resource demanding for an agent implementation.  In some MIBs,
        like the Remote Monitoring (RMON) MIBs, control mechanisms were
        built in order to activate those statistics on demand.  If
        needed, a sorting ('topN') mechanism can be designed, so that a
        sorted view of clients or users is presented for the high level
        debugging.

    o   We built a time-distribution trying to cover both short-lived,
        as well as longer sessions (1-10 secs, 10 secs - 1 min., 1-15
        min., 15 mins-24 hours, longer).

    o   PintServerClientAddress is defined as a SnmpAdminString.  It may
        include an IpAddress and/or name, but we preferred to minimize
        the number of indices at this stage, and keep a human-readable
        format at the same time.

    o   We define pintServerUserIdName as the UserId.  This UserId needs
        to be unique across multiple PINT servers and gateways
        (depending on the architecture) and is mapped to the SessionId.
        One way to achieve this uniqueness is by appending clientId to
        the UserId string before sending to the PINT server.  The
        SessionId could then be a combination of this new UserId and a
        timestamp.

7.  Security Considerations

   There is only one management object defined in this MIB that has a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write (pintSysContact).  There are no
   read-create objects.  This read-write object may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   information that may be sensitive from a business perspective.  One
   could be the customer identification (UserIdName).  Also information
   on PINT services performance might itself be need to be guarded.  It
   is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [13] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [16] is recommended.

RFC 3055                        PINT MIB                   February 2001


   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

8. IANA Considerations

   All extensions to the values listed in this MIB must be done through
   Standards Action processes as defined in RFC 2434 [20].

9. Intellectual Property

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
   Director.
