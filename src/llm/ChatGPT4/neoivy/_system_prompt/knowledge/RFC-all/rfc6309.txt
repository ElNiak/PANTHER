RFC 6309                    MIKEY IANA Rules                 August 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document relaxes the IANA rules for Multimedia Internet KEYing
   (MIKEY) [RFC3830].  The IANA rules defined in [RFC3830], [RFC4563],
   [RFC4909], and [RFC5410] are affected.  In addition, the rules
   specified in [RFC6043] are re-specified here.

   Most of the values in MIKEY namespaces are divided into two ranges:
   "IETF Review" (or "IETF Consensus" as it was previously called) and
   "Reserved for Private Use" [RFC5226].  This document changes, for
   majority of the namespaces, the requirement of "IETF Review" to "IETF
   Review or IESG Approval" [RFC5226].  For some namespaces, the
   requirement is changed to "Specification Required" [RFC5226].

   The rationale for this update is that there can be situations where
   it makes sense to grant an allocation under special circumstances or
   that time has shown that the current requirement is unnecessarily
   strict for some of the namespaces.  By changing the current IANA
   rules to also allow for "IESG Approval" [RFC5226], it becomes
   possible for the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) to
   consider an allocation request, even if it does not fulfill the
   default rule.  For instance, an experimental protocol extension could
   perhaps deserve a new payload type as long as a sufficient number of
   types still remains, and the MIKEY community is happy with such an
   allocation.  Moreover, for some registries, a stable specification
   would be a sufficient requirement, and this is thus reflected in the
   updated IANA rules.  For instance, an RFC via the Independent Stream
   at the RFC Editor is sufficient for some registries and does not
   force an IETF evaluation of a particular new extension for which
   there is no general demand.  Nevertheless, "IETF Review" is still
   encouraged (instead of using the "IESG Approval" path) if there is
   doubt about whether or not it is needed for a new allocation.

   The rest of this document is structured as follows.  Section 2
   defines the new IANA rules.  Section 3 discusses the security
   implications of this document.  Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 explain the
   changes to [RFC3830], [RFC4563], [RFC4909], [RFC5410], and [RFC6043].

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA updated the registries related to MIKEY as specified below.  All
   other MIKEY IANA registries remain unchanged.

   New values for the version field ([RFC3830], Section 6.1) and the C
   envelope key cache indicator ([RFC3830], Section 6.3) field can be
   allocated via "IETF Review".

RFC 6309                    MIKEY IANA Rules                 August 2011


   The "IETF Review" requirement for adding new values into namespaces,
   originally defined in [RFC3830], is to be changed to "IETF Review or
   IESG Approval".  This change affects the following namespaces:

   o  data type ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  Next payload ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  PRF func ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  CS ID map type ([RFC3830], Section 6.1)

   o  Encr alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.2)

   o  MAC alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.2)

   o  DH-Group ([RFC3830], Section 6.4)

   o  S type ([RFC3830], Section 6.5)

   o  TS type ([RFC3830], Section 6.6)

   o  ID Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.7)

   o  Cert Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.7)

   o  Hash func ([RFC3830], Section 6.8)

   o  SRTP Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  SRTP encr alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  SRTP auth alg ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  SRTP PRF ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  FEC order ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  Key Data Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.13)

   o  KV Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.13)

RFC 6309                    MIKEY IANA Rules                 August 2011


   The "IETF Review" requirement for the following registries,
   originally defined in [RFC3830], [RFC4563], [RFC4909], and [RFC5410],
   is to be changed to "Specification Required".

   o  Prot type ([RFC3830], Section 6.10)

   o  Error no ([RFC3830], Section 6.12)

   o  General Extension Type ([RFC3830], Section 6.15)

   o  KEY ID Type ([RFC4563], Section 4)

   o  OMA BCAST Data Subtype ([RFC5410], Section 3)

   The "Specification Required" requirement remains for the following
   namespaces:

   o  TS Role ([RFC6043], Section 6.4)

   o  ID Role ([RFC6043], Section 6.6)

   o  RAND Role ([RFC6043], Section 6.8)

   o  Ticket Type ([RFC6043], Section 6.10)

   The range of valid values for certain namespaces defined in the IANA
   considerations of [RFC3830] was not explicitly defined and is
   clarified here as follows:

             +--------------------------------+--------------+
             | Namespace                      | Valid values |
             +--------------------------------+--------------+
             | C Envelope Key Cache Indicator | 0 - 3        |
             | S type                         | 0 - 15       |
             | Key Data Type                  | 0 - 15       |
             | KV Type                        | 0 - 15       |
             +--------------------------------+--------------+

3.  Security Considerations

   This specification does not change the security properties of MIKEY.
   However, when new values are introduced without IETF consensus, care
   needs to be taken to assure that possible security concerns regarding
   the new values are still addressed.

4.  Changes from RFC 3830

   Section 2 relaxes the requirements from those defined in [RFC3830].
   A number of namespaces now have the "IETF Review or IESG Approval"
   requirement, when they previously had the "IETF Review" requirement.
   In addition, some namespaces now have the "Specification Required"
   requirement.

5.  Changes from RFC 4563

   Section 2 relaxes the requirements from those defined in [RFC4563].
   The KEY ID Type namespace now has the "Specification Required"
   requirement.

6.  Changes from RFC 4909 and RFC 5410

   Section 2 relaxes the requirements from those defined in [RFC4909].
   The OMA BCAST Data Subtype namespace now has the "Specification
   Required" requirement.  Note that [RFC5410] obsoleted [RFC4909] but
   does not actually define the IANA rules itself.  As a result, from
   now on, this RFC defines the IANA requirements for the OMA BCAST Data
   Subtype namespace.

7.  Changes from RFC 6043

   There are no changes to the rules specified in [RFC6043].  However,
   for sake of completeness, Section 2 re-specifies these rules in this
   document, and from now on, this RFC defines the IANA requirements for
   those namespaces.
