         Address Mapping of IPv6 Multicast Packets on Ethernet

Abstract

   When transmitting an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
   address, the IPv6 destination address is mapped to an Ethernet link-
   layer multicast address.  This document clarifies that a mapping of
   an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination address may in some
   circumstances map to an Ethernet link-layer unicast address.

RFC 6085           Unicast Transmission on Link Layer       January 2011


1.  Introduction

   "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over Ethernet Networks" ([RFC2464],
   Section 7) specifies how an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
   address is mapped into an Ethernet link-layer address.  This document
   extends this mapping to explicitly allow for a mapping of an IPv6
   packet with a multicast destination address into an Ethernet link-
   layer unicast address, when it is clear that only one address is
   relevant.

   This mapping does not replace the mapping described in [RFC2464],
   Section 7.  The determination of the unicast Ethernet link-layer
   address and the construction of the outgoing IPv6 packet are out of
   scope for this document.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Receiving IPv6 Multicast Packets

   An IPv6 node receiving an IPv6 packet with a multicast destination
   address and an Ethernet link-layer unicast address MUST NOT drop the
   packet as a result of the use of this form of address mapping.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security vulnerabilities.
