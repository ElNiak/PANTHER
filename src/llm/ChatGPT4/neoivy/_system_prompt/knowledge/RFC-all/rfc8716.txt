Update to the IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures for the Replacement of the
      IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with the IETF
                           Administration LLC

Abstract

   The IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures are described in RFC 7776.

   The IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) has been replaced
   by the IETF Administration LLC, and the IETF Administrative Director
   has been replaced by the IETF LLC Executive Director.  This document
   updates RFC 7776 to amend these terms.

   RFC 7776 contained updates to RFC 7437.  RFC 8713 has incorporated
   those updates, so this document also updates RFC 7776 to remove those
   updates.

1.  Introduction

   The IETF Anti-Harassment Procedures are described in RFC 7776
   [RFC7776].  Those procedures include direction for the IETF Chair and
   Ombudsteam to take advice from the IETF Administrative Oversight
   Committee (IAOC) with respect to the budget available for training.

   The IAOC has been replaced by the IETF Administration LLC, and the
   IETF Administrative Director has been replaced by the IETF LLC
   Executive Director.  This document updates RFC 7776 to amend these
   terms and to update a reference.

   RFC 7776 contained updates to [RFC7437].  [RFC8713] has incorporated
   those updates, so this document also updates RFC 7776 to remove those
   updates.

   This document makes no other changes to the procedures described in
   RFC 7776.

2.  Changes to RFC 7776

2.1.  Changes to Section 3.4

   Section 3.4 of [RFC7776] is about the qualifications and training of
   the Ombudsteam.  The last paragraph of that section is replaced as
   follows:

   OLD

   |  In determining the appropriate training, the IETF Chair and
   |  Ombudsteam shall take professional advice and will consult with
   |  the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) with respect to
   |  the overall IETF budget.

   NEW

   |  In determining the appropriate training, the IETF Chair and
   |  Ombudsteam shall take professional advice and will consult with
   |  the IETF Administration LLC with respect to the overall IETF
   |  budget.

   END

2.2.  Changes to Section 5

   Section 5 of [RFC7776] is about remedies available to the Ombudsteam.
   The last paragraph of that section is replaced as follows:

   OLD

   |  Where specific action is required to ensure that a remedy is
   |  realized or enforced, the Ombudsteam will make a request in
   |  writing to the IETF Secretariat and/or IETF Administrative
   |  Director (IAD) to take action as appropriate.

   NEW

   |  Where specific action is required to ensure that a remedy is
   |  realized or enforced, the Ombudsteam will make a request in
   |  writing to the IETF Secretariat and/or IETF LLC Executive Director
   |  to take action as appropriate.

   END

2.3.  Changes to References to RFC 7437

   RFC 7776 updated RFC 7437 [RFC7437] by allowing the Ombudsteam to
   form a recall petition.  This document does not change any of the
   associated processes.  However, during the process of documenting the
   replacement of the IAOC by the IETF Administration LLC, RFC 7437 has
   been obsoleted by [RFC8713], and as part of that work, [RFC8713] has
   included the update from RFC 7776.

   This document updates RFC 7776 to remove the update of RFC 7437.

2.3.1.  Changes to Metadata

   The following change is made to the metadata at the head of
   [RFC7776]:

   OLD

   |  Updates: 2418, 7437

   NEW

   |  Updates: 2418

   END

2.3.2.  Changes to the Abstract

   The following change is made to text in the Abstract of [RFC7776]:

   DELETE

   |  This document updates RFC 7437 by allowing the Ombudsteam to form
   |  a recall petition without further signatories.

   END

2.3.3.  Changes to Section 5.1

   The following change is made to text in Section 5.1 of [RFC7776]:

   OLD

   |  *  Many IETF management positions are appointed by the NomCom with
   |     confirmation from the IESG, IAB, or ISOC.  [RFC7437] describes
   |     the recall procedure for such appointments.  This document
   |     updates [RFC7437] by allowing the Ombudsteam to form a recall
   |     petition on its own and without requiring 20 signatories from
   |     the community.  Such a petition shall be treated in all ways
   |     like any other recall petition as described in [RFC7437]: that
   |     is, the fact of the petition and its signatories (the
   |     Ombudsteam) shall be announced to the IETF community, and a
   |     Recall Committee Chair shall be appointed to complete the
   |     Recall Committee process.  It is expected that the Recall
   |     Committee will receive a briefing from the Ombudsteam
   |     explaining why recall is considered an appropriate remedy.

   NEW

   |  *  The Ombudsteam may form a recall petition on its own without
   |     requiring signatures from the community as described in
   |     [RFC8713].

   END

3.  IANA Considerations
