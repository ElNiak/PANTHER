                    OFFICIAL ARPA-INTERNET PROTOCOLS


STATUS OF THIS MEMO

   This memo is an official status report on the protocols used in the
   ARPA-Internet community.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

INTRODUCTION

   This RFC identifies the documents specifying the official protocols
   used in the Internet.  Comments indicate any revisions or changes
   planned.

   To first order, the official protocols are those in the "Internet
   Protocol Transition Workbook" (IPTW) dated March 1982.  There are
   several protocols in use that are not in the IPTW.  A few of the
   protocols in the IPTW have been revised.  Notably, the mail protocols
   have been revised and issued as a volume titled "Internet Mail
   Protocols" dated November 1982.  Telnet and the most useful Telnet
   options have been revised and issued as a volume titled "Internet
   Telnet Protocol and Options" (ITP) dated June 1983.  The File
   Transfer Protocol has been revised most recently as RFC 959 which is
   not yet included in any collection.  Some protocols have not been
   revised for many years, these are found in the old "ARPANET Protocol
   Handbook" (APH) dated January 1978.  There is also a volume of
   protocol related information called the "Internet Protocol
   Implementers Guide" (IPIG) dated August 1982.

   This document is organized as a sketchy outline.  The entries are
   protocols (e.g., Transmission Control Protocol).  In each entry there
   are notes on status, specification, comments, other references,
   dependencies, and contact.

      The STATUS is one of: required, recommended, elective, or
      experimental.

      The SPECIFICATION identifies the protocol defining documents.

      The COMMENTS describe any differences from the specification or
      problems with the protocol.

      The OTHER REFERENCES identify documents that comment on or expand
      on the protocol.

      The DEPENDENCIES indicate what other protocols are called upon by
      this protocol.

      The CONTACT indicates a person who can answer questions about the
      protocol.

      In particular, the status may be:

         required

            - all hosts must implement the required protocol,

         recommended

            - all hosts are encouraged to implement the recommended
            protocol,

         elective

            - hosts may implement or not the elective protocol,

         experimental

            - hosts should not implement the experimental protocol
            unless they are participating in the experiment and have
            coordinated their use of this protocol with the contact
            person, and

         none

            - this is not a protocol.

NETWORK LEVEL

   Internet Protocol  --------------------------------------------- (IP)

      STATUS:  Required

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 791 (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         This is the universal protocol of the Internet.  This datagram
         protocol provides the universal addressing of hosts in the
         Internet.

         A few minor problems have been noted in this document.

         The most serious is a bit of confusion in the route options.
         The route options have a pointer that indicates which octet of
         the route is the next to be used.  The confusion is between the
         phrases "the pointer is relative to this option" and "the
         smallest legal value for the pointer is 4".  If you are
         confused, forget about the relative part, the pointer begins
         at 4.

         Another important point is the alternate reassembly procedure
         suggested in RFC 815.

         Some changes are in the works for the security option.

         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You
         have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not
         include ICMP.

   Internet Control Message Protocol  --------------------------- (ICMP)

      STATUS:  Required

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 792 (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         The control messages and error reports that go with the
         Internet Protocol.

         A few minor errors in the document have been noted.
         Suggestions have been made for additional types of redirect
         message and additional destination unreachable messages.

         A proposal for two additional ICMP message types is made in
         RFC 950 "Internet Subnets", Address Mask Request (A1=17), and
         Address Mask Reply (A2=18).  The details of these ICMP types
         are subject to change.  Use of these ICMP types is
         experimental.

         Note that ICMP is defined to be an integral part of IP.  You
         have not completed an implementation of IP if it does not
         include ICMP.

HOST LEVEL

   User Datagram Protocol  --------------------------------------- (UDP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 768 (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides a datagram service to applications.  Adds port
         addressing to the IP services.

         The only change noted for the UDP specification is a minor
         clarification that if in computing the checksum a padding octet
         is used for the computation it is not transmitted or counted in
         the length.

   Transmission Control Protocol  -------------------------------- (TCP)

      STATUS:  Recommended

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 793 (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         Provides reliable end-to-end data stream service.

         Many comments and corrections have been received for the TCP
         specification document.  These are primarily document bugs
         rather than protocol bugs.

         Event Processing Section:  There are many minor corrections and
         clarifications needed in this section.

         Push:  There are still some phrases in the document that give a
         "record mark" flavor to the push.  These should be further
         clarified.  The push is not a record mark.

         Urgent:  Page 17 is wrong.  The urgent pointer points to the
         last octet of urgent data (not to the first octet of non-urgent
         data).

Official ARPA-Internet Protocols                                 RFC 961


         Listening Servers:  Several comments have been received on
         difficulties with contacting listening servers.  There should
         be some discussion of implementation issues for servers, and
         some notes on alternative models of system and process
         organization for servers.

         Maximum Segment Size:  The maximum segment size option should
         be generalized and clarified.  It can be used to either
         increase or decrease the maximum segment size from the default.
         The TCP Maximum Segment Size is the IP Maximum Datagram Size
         minus forty.  The default IP Maximum Datagram Size is 576.  The
         default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.  For further
         discussion, see RFC 879.

         Idle Connections:  There have been questions about
         automatically closing idle connections.  Idle connections are
         ok, and should not be closed.  There are several cases where
         idle connections arise, for example, in Telnet when a user is
         thinking for a long time following a message from the server
         computer before his next input.  There is no TCP "probe"
         mechanism, and none is needed.

         Queued Receive Data on Closing:  There are several points where
         it is not clear from the description what to do about data
         received by the TCP but not yet passed to the user,
         particularly when the connection is being closed.  In general,
         the data is to be kept to give to the user if he does a RECV
         call.

         Out of Order Segments:  The description says that segments that
         arrive out of order, that is, are not exactly the next segment
         to be processed, may be kept on hand.  It should also point out
         that there is a very large performance penalty for not doing
         so.

         User Time Out:  This is the time out started on an open or send
         call.  If this user time out occurs the user should be
         notified, but the connection should not be closed or the TCB
         deleted.  The user should explicitly ABORT the connection if he
         wants to give up.

      COMMENTS:

         Defines a capability to combine several segments from different
         higher level protocols in one IP datagram.

         No current experiment in progress.  There is some question as
         to the extent to which the sharing this protocol envisions can
         actually take place.  Also, there are some issues about the
         information captured in the multiplexing header being (a)
         insufficient, or (b) over specific.

      COMMENTS:

         The Binary Transmission, Echo, Suppress Go Ahead, Status,
         Timing Mark, and Extended Options List options have been
         recently updated and reissued.  These are the most frequently
         implemented options.

         The remaining options should be reviewed and the useful ones
         should be revised and reissued.  The others should be
         eliminated.

         The following are recommended:  Binary Transmission, Echo,
         Suppress Go Ahead, Status, Timing Mark, and Extended Options
         List.

   Trivial File Transfer Protocol  ------------------------------ (TFTP)

      STATUS:  Elective

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 783 (in IPTW)

      COMMENTS:

         A very simple file moving protocol, no access control is
         provided.

         This is in use in several local networks.

         Ambiguities in the interpretation of several of the transfer
         modes should be  clarified, and additional transfer modes could
         be defined.  Additional error codes could be defined to more
         clearly identify problems.

   Simple File Transfer Protocol  ------------------------------- (SFTP)

      STATUS:  Experimental

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 913

      COMMENTS:

         SFTP is a simple file transfer protocol.  It fills the need of
         people wanting a protocol that is more useful than TFTP but
         easier to implement (and less powerful) than FTP.  SFTP
         supports user access control, file transfers, directory
         listing, directory changing, file renaming and deleting.

         SFTP can be implemented with any reliable 8-bit byte stream
         oriented protocol, this document describes its TCP
         specification.  SFTP uses only one TCP connection; whereas TFTP
         implements a connection over UDP, and FTP uses two TCP
         connections (one using the TELNET protocol).

         Please discuss any plans for implementation or use of this
         protocol with the contact.

         There have been many misunderstandings and errors in the early
         implementations.  Some documentation of these problems can be
         found in the file [ISIB]<SMTP>MAIL.ERRORS.

         Some minor differences between RFC 821 and RFC 822 should be

         This specification has significant problems:  1) The name
         syntax is out of date.  2) The protocol details are ambiguous,
         in particular, the length octet either does or doesn't include
         itself and the op code.  3) The extensions are not supported by
         any known implementation.

   Post Office Protocol - Version 2  ---------------------------- (POP2)

      STATUS:  Experimental

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 937

      COMMENTS:

         The intent of the Post Office Protocol - Version 2 (POP2) is to
         allow a user's workstation to access mail from a mailbox
         server.  It is expected that mail will be posted from the
         workstation to the mailbox server via the Simple Mail Transfer
         Protocol (SMTP).

         Please discuss any plans for implementation or use of this
         protocol with the contact.

   Reliable Asynchronous Transfer Protocol  --------------------- (RATP)

      SPECIFICATION:  RFC 916

      COMMENTS:

         This paper specifies a protocol which allows two programs to
         reliably communicate over a communication link.  It ensures
         that the data entering one end of the link if received arrives
         at the other end intact and unaltered.  This proposed protocol
         is designed to operate over a full duplex point-to-point
         connection.  It contains some features which tailor it to the
         RS-232 links now in current use.

         protocol with the contact.
