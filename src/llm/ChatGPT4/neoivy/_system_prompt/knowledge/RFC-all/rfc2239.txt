Abstract

   This memo defines an portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing 10 and 100 Mb/second
   Medium Attachment Units (MAUs) based on IEEE Std 802.3 Section 30,
   "10 & 100 Mb/s Management," October 26, 1995.

1.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [6] - the mechanisms used
        for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [5] - the core set of
        managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    the protocol, STD 15, RFC 1157 [10] and/or RFC 1905 [9] -
        the protocol used for accessing managed information.

   Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [7], and conformance
   statements are defined in RFC 1904 [8].

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

1.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

2.  Overview

2.1.  Relationship to RFC 1515

   This MIB is intended to be a superset of that defined by RFC 1515
   [11], which will go to historic status.  This MIB includes all of the
   objects contained in that MIB, plus several new ones which provide
   additional capabilities.  Implementors are encouraged to support all
   applicable conformance groups in order to make the best use of the
   new functionality provided by this MIB.  The new objects provide
   management support for:

   o    management of 100 Mb/s devices

   o    auto-negotiation on interface MAUs

   o    jack management

2.2.  MAU Management

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE 802.3
   MAU.  Several types of MAUs are defined in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD
   standard [1] and [2].  These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3
   repeaters or to 802.3 (Ethernet-like) interfaces.  For convenience
   this document refers to these devices as "repeater MAUs" and
   "interface MAUs."

   The definitions presented here are based on Section 30.5, "Layer
   Management for 10 & 100 Mb/s Medium Attachment Units (MAUs)", and
   Annex 30A, "GDMO Specifications for 802.3 managed objects" of IEEE
   Std 802.3u-1995.  That specification includes definitions for both
   10Mb/s and 100Mb/s devices, and is essentially a superset of the
   10Mb/s definitions given by IEEE 802.3 Section 20.  This
   specification is intended to serve the same purpose: to provide for
   management of both 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s MAUs.

2.3.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   It is assumed that an agent implementing this MIB will also implement
   (at least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [5].  The following
   sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should implement.

2.3.1.  Relationship to the MIB-II 'interfaces' group

   The sections of this document that define interface MAU-related
   objects specify an extension to the 'interfaces' group of MIB-II.  An
   agent implementing these interface-MAU related objects must also

RFC 2239          Managed Objects for IEEE 802.3 MAUs      November 1997


   implement the 'interfaces' group of MIB-II.  The value of the object
   ifMauIfIndex is the same as the value of 'ifIndex' used to
   instantiate the interface to which the given MAU is connected.

   It is expected that an agent implementing the interface-MAU related
   objects in this MIB will also implement the Ethernet- like Interfaces
   MIB, RFC 1650.

   (Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the
   sense of MIB-II's 'interfaces' group.)

2.3.2.  Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB

   The section of this document that defines repeater MAU-related
   objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in
   [4].  An agent implementing these repeater-MAU related objects must
   also implement the 802.3 Repeater MIB.

   The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to
   instantiate a repeater MAU variable shall be the same as the values
   of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the
   port to which the given MAU is connected.

2.4.  Management of Internal MAUs

   In some situations, a MAU can be "internal" -- i.e., its
   functionality is implemented entirely within a device.  For example,
   a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater- MAU and/or an
   internal interface-MAU through which management communications
   originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass in order to
   reach the management agent associated with the repeater.  Such
   internal MAUs may or may not be managed.  If they are managed,
   objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate
   MIB subtree:

   dot3RpMauBasicGroup for internal repeater-MAUs and
   dot3IfMauBasicGroup for internal interface-MAUs.

               implemented as a read-only object by those agents
               and MAUs that do not implement software control of
               the MAU state.  Some agents may not support
               setting the value of this object to some of the
               enumerated values.

               The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in a
               state other than one of the states 2 through 6.

               The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
               true state is unknown; for example, when it is
               being initialized.

               A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
               functional, operates, and passes signals to its
               attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to its
               specification.

               A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to idle
               and the media transmitter to idle or fault, if
               supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to link
               type MAUs.  The state of rpMauMediaAvailable is
               unaffected.

               A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
               condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter as
               though it were powered down or not connected.  The
               MAU may return other(1) value for the
               rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
               when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this state
               will remove power from the AUI.

               Setting this variable to the value reset(6) resets
               the MAU in the same manner as a power-off, power-
               on cycle of at least one-half second would.  The
               agent is not required to return the value reset
               (6).

               Setting this variable to the value operational(3),
               standby(4), or shutdown(5) causes the MAU to

       DESCRIPTION
               "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
               10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to the
               link test fail state/low light function.  For an
               AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU this
               indicates whether or not loopback is detected on
               the DI circuit.  The value of this attribute
               persists between packets for MAU types AUI,
               10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

               The value other(1) is returned if the
               mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 6.

               The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
               true state is unknown; for example, when it is
               being initialized.  At power-up or following a
               reset, the value of this attribute will be unknown
               for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For these MAUs
               loopback will be tested on each transmission
               during which no collision is detected.  If DI is
               receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a
               transmission and there has been no collision
               during the transmission then loopback will be
               detected.  The value of this attribute will only
               change during non-collided transmissions for AUI,

               coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.

               For 100BASE-T4, 100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX the
               enumerations match the states within the
               respective link integrity state diagrams, fig 23-
               12 and 24-15 of sections 23 and 24 of [2].  Any
               MAU which implements management of auto-
               negotiation will map remote fault indication to
               remote fault.

               The value available(3) indicates that the link,
               light, or loopback is normal.  The value
               notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light, or
               no loopback.

               The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
               has been detected at the remote end of the link.
               This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
               End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
               faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
               The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8), and
               remoteTest(9) should be used instead of
               remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
               is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

               The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
               invalid signal has been received from the other
               end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only to
               MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

               Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII is
               present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
               (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
               maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic zero
               in the link status bit (reference section
               22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
               notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4) takes
               precedence over the value remoteFault(5)."

               implemented as a read-only object by those agents
               and MAUs that do not implement software control of
               the MAU state.  Some agents may not support
               setting the value of this object to some of the
               enumerated values.

               The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in a
               state other than one of the states 2 through 6.

               The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
               true state is unknown; for example, when it is
               being initialized.

               A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
               functional, operates, and passes signals to its
               attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to its
               specification.

               A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to idle
               and the media transmitter to idle or fault, if
               supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to link
               type MAUs.  The state of ifMauMediaAvailable is
               unaffected.

               A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
               condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter as
               though it were powered down or not connected.  The
               MAU may return other(1) value for the
               ifMauJabberState and ifMauMediaAvailable objects
               when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this state
               will remove power from the AUI.

               Setting this variable to the value reset(6) resets
               the MAU in the same manner as a power-off, power-
               on cycle of at least one-half second would.  The
               agent is not required to return the value reset
               (6).

               Setting this variable to the value operational(3),
               standby(4), or shutdown(5) causes the MAU to

       DESCRIPTION
               "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
               10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to the
               link test fail state/low light function.  For an
               AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU this
               indicates whether or not loopback is detected on
               the DI circuit.  The value of this attribute
               persists between packets for MAU types AUI,
               10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

               The value other(1) is returned if the
               mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 6.

               The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
               true state is unknown; for example, when it is
               being initialized.  At power-up or following a
               reset, the value of this attribute will be unknown
               for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For these MAUs
               loopback will be tested on each transmission
               during which no collision is detected.  If DI is
               receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a
               transmission and there has been no collision
               during the transmission then loopback will be
               detected.  The value of this attribute will only
               change during non-collided transmissions for AUI,

               coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.

               For 100BASE-T4, 100BASE-TX and 100BASE-FX the
               enumerations match the states within the
               respective link integrity state diagrams, fig 23-
               12 and 24-15 of sections 23 and 24 of [2].  Any
               MAU which implements management of auto-
               negotiation will map remote fault indication to
               remote fault.

               The value available(3) indicates that the link,
               light, or loopback is normal.  The value
               notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light, or
               no loopback.

               The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
               has been detected at the remote end of the link.
               This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
               End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
               faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
               The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8), and
               remoteTest(9) should be used instead of
               remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
               is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

               The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
               invalid signal has been received from the other
               end of the link.  InvalidSignal(6) applies only to
               MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

               Where an IEEE Std 802.3u-1995 clause 22 MII is
               present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
               (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
               maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic zero
               in the link status bit (reference section
               22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
               notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4) takes
               precedence over the value remoteFault(5)."

               10 or 100 Mb/s baseband MAU type, to be used in
               conjunction with the operational MAU type denoted
               by ifMauType.

               The set of possible values for this object is the
               same as the set defined for the ifMauType object.

               This object represents the administratively-
               configured type of the MAU.  If auto-negotiation
               is not enabled or is not implemented for this MAU,
               the value of this object determines the
               operational type of the MAU.  In this case, a set
               to this object will force the MAU into the
               specified operating mode.

               If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled for
               this MAU, the operational type of the MAU is

               this object denotes the type to which the MAU will
               automatically revert if/when auto-negotiation is
               later disabled.

               NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  It may be necessary to
               provide for underlying hardware implementations
               which do not follow the exact behavior specified
               above.  In particular, when
               ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled
               to disabled, the agent implementation must ensure
               that the operational type of the MAU (as reported
               by ifMauType) correctly transitions to the value
               specified by this object, rather than continuing

               auto-negotiation function."

6.  Security Considerations

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information should be employed in such environments.  The method for
   this authentication is a function of the SNMP Administrative
   Framework, and has not been expanded by this MIB.

   Several objects in this MIB allow write access.  Setting these
   objects can have a serious effect on the operation of the network,
   including enabling or disabling a MAU, changing a MAU's default type,
   enabling, disabling or restarting autonegotiation, or modifying the
   capabilities that a MAU advertizes during autonegotiation.  It is
   recommended that implementers seriously consider whether set
   operations should be allowed without providing, at a minimum,
   authentication of request origin.
