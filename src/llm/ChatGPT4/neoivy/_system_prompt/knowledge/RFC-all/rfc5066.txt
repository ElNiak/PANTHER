Abstract

   This document defines Management Information Base (MIB) modules for
   use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   This document describes extensions to the Ethernet-like Interfaces
   MIB and Medium Attachment Unit (MAU) MIB modules with a set of
   objects for managing Ethernet in the First Mile Copper (EFMCu)
   interfaces 10PASS-TS and 2BASE-TL, defined in IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004
   (note: IEEE Std 802.3ah-2004 has been integrated into IEEE Std 802.3-
   2005).  In addition, a set of objects is defined, describing cross-
   connect capability of a managed device with multi-layer (stacked)
   interfaces, extending the stack management objects in the Interfaces
   Group MIB and the Inverted Stack Table MIB modules.

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


1.  Introduction

   New Ethernet-like interfaces have been defined in the Institute of
   Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 802.3ah-2004
   [802.3ah], a.k.a.  Ethernet in the First Mile (EFM), which is now a
   part of the base IEEE Standard 802.3-2005 [802.3].  In particular,
   2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS physical interfaces (PHYs), defined over
   voice-grade copper pairs, have been specified for the long and short
   reach, respectively.  These interfaces, collectively called EFM
   Copper (EFMCu), are based on Single-pair High-speed Digital
   Subscriber Line (SHDSL) [G.991.2] and Very High speed Digital
   Subscriber Line (VDSL) [G.993.1] technology, supporting optional
   Physical Medium Entity (PME) aggregation (a.k.a. multi-pair bonding)
   with variable rates.

   2BASE-TL PHY is capable of providing at least 2 Mbps over a 2700 m
   long single copper pair with a mean Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10^-7
   (using 5 dB target noise margin).

   10PASS-TS PHY is capable of providing at least 10 Mbps over a 750 m
   long single copper pair with a mean BER of 10^-7 (using 6 dB target
   noise margin).

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for use
   with network management protocols in the Internet community to manage
   EFMCu interfaces.  In addition, a MIB module is defined describing
   the cross-connect capability of a stacked interface.

   Note that managed objects for Operation, Administration and
   Maintenance (OAM) and Ethernet over Passive Optical Networks (EPON)
   clauses of IEEE 802.3ah are defined in EFM-COMMON-MIB [RFC4878] and
   EFM-EPON-MIB [RFC4837], respectively.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies MIB
   modules that are compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC
   2580 [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Relation to Other MIB Modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the Interfaces Group MIB (IF-MIB), Ethernet-Like
   (EtherLike-MIB), MAU (MAU-MIB), SHDSL (HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB), and
   VDSL (VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB) modules are discussed.

3.1.  Relation to Interfaces Group MIB Module

   2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PHYs specified in the EFM-CU-MIB module are
   stacked (a.k.a. aggregated or bonded) Ethernet interfaces and as such
   are managed using generic interface management objects defined in the
   IF-MIB [RFC2863].

   The stack management (i.e., actual connection of the sub-layers to
   the top-layer interface) is done via the ifStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-MIB [RFC2863], and its inverse ifInvStackTable, as defined in
   the IF-INVERTED-STACK-MIB [RFC2864].

   The new tables ifCapStackTable and its inverse ifInvCapStackTable
   defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module below, extend the stack
   management with an ability to describe possible connections or cross-
   connect capability, when a flexible cross-connect matrix is present
   between the interface layers.

3.1.1.  Layering Model

   An EFMCu interface can aggregate up to 32 Physical Medium Entity
   (PME) sub-layer devices (modems), using the so-called PME Aggregation
   Function (PAF).

   A generic EFMCu device can have a number of Physical Coding Sublayer
   (PCS) ports, each connected to a Media Access Controller (MAC) via a
   Medium Independent Interface (MII) at the upper layer, and cross-
   connected to a number of underlying PMEs, with a single PCS per PME
   relationship.  See clause 61.1 of [802.3ah] for more details.

   Each PME in the aggregated EFMCu port is represented in the Interface
   table (ifTable) as a separate interface with ifType of shdsl(169) for
   2BASE-TL or vdsl(97) for 10PASS-TS.  The ifType values are defined in
   [IANAifType-MIB].

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


   ifSpeed for each PME SHALL return the actual data bitrate of the
   active PME (e.g., for 2BaseTL PMEs it is a multiple of 64 Kbps).  A
   zero value SHALL be returned when the PME is Initializing or Down.

   The ifSpeed of the PCS is the sum of the current operating data rates
   of all PMEs in the aggregation group, without the 64/65-octet
   encapsulation overhead and PAF overhead, but accounting for the
   Inter-Frame Gaps (IFGs).

   When using the stated definition of ifSpeed for the PCS, there would
   be no frame loss in the following configuration (the test-sets are
   configured to generate 100% of back-to-back traffic, i.e., minimal
   IFG, at 10 or 100 Mbps, with min and max frame sizes; the EFM
   interfaces are aggregated, to achieve the shown speed):

          Figure 2: Use of ifTable and ifMauTable for EFMCu ports

   The ifStackTable is indexed by the ifIndex values of the aggregated
   EFMCu port (PCS) and the PMEs connected to it. ifStackTable allows a
   Network Management application to determine which PMEs are connected
   to a particular PCS and change connections (if supported by the
   application).  The ifInvStackTable, being an inverted version of the
   ifStackTable, provides an efficient means for a Network Management
   application to read a subset of the ifStackTable and thereby
   determine which PCS runs on top of a particular PME.

   A new table ifCapStackTable, defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,
   specifies for each higher-layer interface (e.g., PCS port) a list of
   lower-layer interfaces (e.g., PMEs), which can possibly be cross-
   connected to that higher-layer interface, determined by the cross-
   connect capability of the device.  This table, modeled after
   ifStackTable, is read-only, reflecting current cross-connect
   capability of stacked interface, which can be dynamic in some
   implementations (e.g., if PMEs are located on a pluggable module and
   the module is pulled out).  Note that PME availability per PCS,
   described by ifCapStackTable, can be constrained by other parameters,
   for example, by aggregation capacity of a PCS or by the PME in
   question being already connected to another PCS.  So, in order to

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


   ensure that a particular PME can be connected to the PCS, all
   respective parameters (e.g., ifCapStackTable, ifStackTable, and
   efmCuPAFCapacity) SHALL be inspected.

   The ifInvCapStackTable, also defined in the IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module,
   describes which higher-layer interfaces (e.g., PCS ports) can
   possibly be connected to a particular lower-layer interface (e.g.,
   PME), providing an inverted mapping of the ifCapStackTable.  While it
   contains no additional information beyond that already contained in
   the ifCapStackTable, the ifInvCapStackTable has the ifIndex values in
   its INDEX clause in the reverse order, i.e., the lower-layer
   interface first, and the higher-layer interface second, providing an
   efficient means for a Network Management application to read a subset
   of the ifCapStackTable and thereby determine which interfaces can be
   connected to run on top of a particular interface.

3.1.2.  PME Aggregation Function (PAF)

   The PME Aggregation Function (PAF) allows a number of PMEs to be
   aggregated onto a PCS port, by fragmenting the Ethernet frames,
   transmitting the fragments over multiple PMEs, and assembling the
   original frames at the remote port.  PAF is OPTIONAL, meaning that a
   device with a single PME MAY perform fragmentation and re-assembly if
   this function is supported by the device.  Note however that the
   agent is REQUIRED to report on the PAF capability for all EFMCu ports
   (2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS).

   The EFM-CU-MIB module allows a Network Management application to
   query the PAF capability and enable/disable it if supported.  Note
   that enabling PAF effectively turns on fragmentation and re-assembly,
   even on a single-PME port.

3.1.3.  Discovery Operation

   The EFMCu ports may optionally support discovery operation, whereby
   PMEs, during initialization, exchange information about their
   respective aggregation groups (PCS).  This information can then be
   used to detect copper misconnections or for an automatic assignment
   of the local PMEs into aggregation groups instead of a fixed pre-
   configuration.

   The MIB modules defined in this document allow a Network Management
   application to control the EFM Discovery mechanism and query its
   results.  Note that the Discovery mechanism can work only if PAF is
   supported and enabled.

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


   Two tables are used by the EFM Discovery mechanism: ifStackTable and
   ifCapStackTable.  The following pseudo-code gives an example of the
   Discovery and automatic PME assignment for a generic PAF-enabled
   multi-PCS EFMCu device, located at Central Office (CO), using objects
   defined in these MIB modules and in the IF-MIB (Note that automatic
   PME assignment is only shown here for the purposes of the example.
   Fixed PME pre-assignment, manual assignment, or auto-assignment using
   an alternative internal algorithm may be chosen by a particular
   implementation):

 // Go over all PCS ports in the CO device
 FOREACH pcs[i] IN CO_device
 { // Perform discovery and auto-assignment only on PAF enabled ports
   // with room for more PMEs
   IF ( pcs[i].PAFSupported AND pcs[i].NumPMEs &lt; pcs[i].PAFCapacity )
   { // Assign a unique 6-octet local discovery code to the PCS
     // e.g., MAC address
     dc = pcs[i].DiscoveryCode = MAC[i];
     // Go over all disconnected PMEs, which can
     // potentially be connected to the PCS
     FOREACH pme[j] IN ifCapStackTable[pcs[i]] AND
                    NOT IN ifStackTable[pcs[i]]  // not connected
     { // Try to grab the remote RT_device, by writing the value
       // of the local 6-octet discovery code to the remote
       // discovery code register (via handshake mechanism).
       // This operation is atomic Set-if-Clear action, i.e., it
       // would succeed only if the remote discovery register was
       // zero.  Read the remote discovery code register via Get
       // operation to see if the RT_device, attached via the PME
       // is indeed marked as being the CO_device peer.
       pme[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode = dc;          // Set-if-Clear
       r = pme[j].RemoteDiscoveryCode;           // Get
       IF ( r == dc AND pcs[i].NumPMEs &lt; pcs[i].PAFCapacity)
       { // Remote RT_device connected via PME[j] is/was a peer
         // for PCS[i] and there is room for another PME in the

           // it belongs to a connected RT_device "grabbed" by
           // the CO_device.

           IF ( r == dc AND pcs[i].NumPMEs &lt; pcs[i].PAFCapacity)
           { // Physically connect the PME to the PCS
             // (pcs[i] is auto-added TO ifInvStackTable[pme[k]])
             ADD pme[k] TO ifStackTable[pcs[i]];
             pcs[i].NumPMEs = pcs[i].NumPMEs + 1;
           }
         }
       }
       // At this point we have discovered all local PMEs which
       // are physically connected to the same remote RT_device
       // and connected them to PCS[i].  Go to the next PCS.
       BREAK;
     }
   }
 }

   An SNMP Agent for an EFMCu device builds the ifCapStackTable and its
   inverse ifInvCapStackTable according to the information contained in
   the Clause 45 PME_Available_register (see [802.3ah] 61.1.5.3 and
   45.2.3.20).

   Adding a PME to the ifStackTable row for a specific PCS involves
   actual connection of the PME to the PCS, which can be done by
   modifying Clause 45 PME_Aggregate_register (see [802.3ah] 61.1.5.3
   and 45.2.3.21).

   Note that the PCS port does not have to be operationally 'down' for
   the connection to succeed.  In fact, a dynamic PME addition (and
   removal) MAY be implemented with an available PME being initialized
   first (by setting its ifAdminStatus to 'up') and then added to an
   operationally 'up' PCS port, by modifying a respective ifStackTable
   (and respective ifInvStackTable) entry.

   It is RECOMMENDED that a removal of the last operationally 'up' PME
   from an operationally 'up' PCS would be rejected by the
   implementation, as this action would completely drop the link.

3.1.4.  EFMCu Ports Initialization

   EFMCu ports being built on top of xDSL technology require a lengthy
   initialization or 'training' process, before any data can pass.
   During this initialization, both ends of a link (peers) work
   cooperatively to achieve the required data rate on a particular




Beili                       Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


   copper pair.  Sometimes, when the copper line is too long or the
   noise on the line is too high, that 'training' process may fail to
   achieve a specific target rate with required characteristics.

   The ifAdminStatus object from the IF-MIB controls the desired state
   of a PCS with all the PMEs connected to it or of an individual PME
   port.  Setting this object to 'up' instructs a particular PCS or PME
   to start the initialization process, which may take tens of seconds
   for EFMCu ports, especially if PAF is involved.  The ifOperStatus
   object shows the operational state of an interface (extended by the
   ifMauMediaAvailable object from MAU-MIB for PCS and
   efmCuPmeOperStatus defined in the EFM-CU-MIB module for PME
   interfaces).

   A disconnected PME may be initialized by changing the ifAdminState
   from 'down' to 'up'.  Changing the ifAdminState to 'up' on the PCS
   initializes all PMEs connected to that particular PCS.  Note that in
   case of PAF some interfaces may fail to initialize while others
   succeed.  The PCS is considered operationally 'up' if at least one
   PME aggregated by its PAF is operationally 'up'.  When all PMEs
   connected to the PCS are 'down', the PCS SHALL be considered
   operationally 'lowerLayerDown'.  The PCS SHALL be considered
   operationally 'notPresent' if it is not connected to any PME.  The
   PCS/PME interface SHALL remain operationally 'down' during
   initialization.

   The efmCuPmeOperStatus defined in the EFM-CU-MIB module expands PME's
   ifOperStatus value of 'down' to 'downReady', 'downNotReady', and
   'init' values, indicating various EFMCu PME-specific states.

3.1.5.  Usage of ifTable

   Both PME and PCS interfaces of the EFMCu PHY are managed using
   interface-specific management objects defined in the EFM-CU-MIB
   module and generic interface objects from the ifTable of IF-MIB, with
   all management table entries referenced by the interface index
   ifIndex.

   The following table summarizes EFMCu-specific interpretations for
   some of the ifTable objects specified in the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup:

3.2.  Relation to SHDSL MIB Module

   G.SHDSL.bis modems, similar to PMEs comprising a 2BASE-TL port, are
   described in the HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB module [RFC4319].  Note that
   not all attributes of G.SHDSL modems reflected in the HDSL2-SHDSL-
   LINE-MIB module have adequate management objects (Clause 30
   attributes and Clause 45 registers) in the EFM standard.

   Because of these differences and for the purposes of simplicity,
   unification of attributes common to both 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PMEs,
   and name consistency (e.g., prefixing the 2BASE-TL PME related
   objects with 'efmCuPme2B' instead of 'hdsl2shdsl'), it was decided
   not to reference HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB objects, but define all the
   relevant objects in the EFM-CU-MIB module.

   However, if some functionality not available in the EFM-CU-MIB module
   is required and supported by the PME, e.g., performance monitoring,
   relevant HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB groups MAY be included and applied for
   PMEs of 2BASE-TL subtype.

3.3.  Relation to VDSL MIB Module

   VDSL modems, similar to the PME(s) comprising a 10PASS-TS port, are
   described in the VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB module [RFC4070].  Note that
   not all attributes of VDSL modems reflected in the VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-
   MIB module have adequate management objects (Clause 30 attributes and
   Clause 45 registers) in the EFM standard.

   Because of these differences and for the purposes of simplicity,
   unification of attributes common to both 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PMEs,
   and name consistency, it was decided not to reference VDSL-LINE-EXT-
   MCM-MIB objects, but define all the relevant objects in the EFM-CU-
   MIB module.

   However, if some functionality not available in the EFM-CU-MIB module
   is required and supported by the PME, relevant VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB
   groups MAY be included and applied for PMEs of 10PASS-TS subtype.

3.4.  Relation to Ethernet-Like and MAU MIB Modules

   The implementation of the EtherLike-MIB [RFC3635] and MAU-MIB
   [RFC4836] modules is REQUIRED for EFMCu interfaces.

   Two new values of ifMauType (OBJECT-IDENTITIES of dot3MauType) and
   corresponding bit definitions of ifMauTypeListBits
   (IANAifMauTypeListBits) have been defined in the IANA-MAU-MIB module
   [RFC4836] for EFMCu MAUs:

   o  dot3MauType2BaseTL and b2BaseTL - for 2BASE-TL MAU

   o  dot3MauType10PassTS and b10PassTS - for 10PASS-TS MAU

   Additionally, the IANA-MAU-MIB module defines two new values of
   ifMauMediaAvailable, specifically for EFMCu ports: availableReduced
   and ready (in textual convention IANAifMauMediaAvailable).  Due to
   the PME aggregation, the EFMCu interpretation of some possible
   ifMauMediaAvailable values differs from other MAUs as follows:

   o  unknown - the EFMCu interface (PCS with connected PMEs) is
      Initializing

   o  ready - the interface is Down, at least one PME in the aggregation
      group (all PMEs connected to the PCS) is ready for handshake

   o  available - the interface is Up, all PMEs in the aggregation group
      are up





Beili                       Standards Track                    [Page 12]

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


   o  notAvailable - the interface is Down, all PMEs in the aggregation
      group are Down, no handshake tones are detected by any PME

   o  availableReduced - the interface is Up, a link fault is detected
      at the receive direction by one or more PMEs in the aggregation
      group, but at least one PME is Up

   o  pmdLinkFault - a link fault is detected at the receive direction
      by all PMEs in the aggregation group

   As an EtherLike interface, every EFMCu port (an ifEntry representing
   a consolidation of LLC, MAC, and PCS (sub)layers) SHALL return an
   ifType of ethernetCsmacd(6).  While most of the MAU characteristics
   are not applicable to the EFMCu ports (no auto-negotiation, false
   carriers, or jabber), they SHALL return an appropriate ifMauType
   (dot3MauType2BaseTL or dot3mauType10PassTS) in order to direct the
   management software to look in the EFM-CU-MIB module for the desired
   information.  For example, the information on the particular EFMCu
   flavor that an EFMCu port is running is available from
   efmCuOperSubType, defined in the EFM-CU-MIB module.

   Since EFMCu PMEs are not EtherLike interfaces, they cannot be
   instantiated as MAU interface objects.

4.  MIB Structure

4.1.  EFM Copper MIB Overview

   The main management objects defined in the EFM-CU-MIB module are
   split into 2 groups:

   o  efmCuPort - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status, and notifications, common to all EFMCu PHYs.

   o  efmCuPme - containing objects for configuration, capabilities,
      status, and notifications of EFMCu PMEs.

   The efmCuPme group in turn contains efmCuPme2B and efmCuPme10P
   groups, which define PME profiles specific to 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS
   PMEs, respectively, as well as PME-specific status information.

4.2.  Interface Stack Capability MIB Overview

   The IF-CAP-STACK-MIB module contains 2 tables:

   o  ifCapStackTable - containing objects that define possible
      relationships among the sub-layers of an interface with flexible
      cross-connect (cross-connect capability).



Beili                       Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


   o  ifInvCapStackTable - an inverse of the ifCapstackTable.

4.3.  PME Profiles

   Since a managed node can have a large number of EFMCu PHYs,
   provisioning every parameter on every EFMCu PHY may become
   burdensome.  Moreover, most PMEs are provisioned identically with the
   same set of parameters.  To simplify the provisioning process, the
   EFM-CU-MIB module makes use of configuration profiles, similar to the
   HDSL2-SHDSL-LINE-MIB and VDSL-LINE-EXT-MCM-MIB modules.  A profile is
   a set of parameters, used either for configuration or representation
   of a PME.  The same profile can be shared by multiple PME ports using
   the same configuration.

   The PME profiles are defined in the efmCuPme2BProfileTable and
   efmCuPme10PProfileTable for 2BASE-TL and 10PASS-TS PMEs,
   respectively.  There are 12 predefined standard profiles for 2BASE-TL
   and 22 standard profiles for 10PASS-TS, defined in 802.3ah and
   dedicated for rapid provisioning of EFMCu PHYs in most scenarios.  In
   addition, the EFM-CU-MIB defines two additional predefined profiles
   for "best-effort" provisioning of 2BASE-TL PMEs.  An ability to
   define new configuration profiles is also provided to allow for EFMCu
   deployment tailored to specific copper environments and spectral
   regulations.

   A specific configuration or administrative profile is assigned to a
   specific PME via the efmCuPmeAdminProfile object.  If
   efmCuPmeAdminProfile is zero, then the efmCuAdminProfile object of
   the PCS port connected to the PME determines the configuration
   profile (or a list of possible profiles) for that PME.  This
   mechanism allows specifying a common profile for all PMEs connected
   to the PCS port, with an ability to change individual PME profiles by
   setting efmCuPmeAdminProfile object, which overwrites the profile set
   by efmCuAdminProfile.

   A current operating PME profile is pointed to by the
   efmCuPmeOperProfile object.  Note that this profile entry can be
   created automatically to reflect achieved parameters in adaptive (not
   fixed) initialization.

4.4.  Mapping of IEEE 802.3ah Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [802.3ah] Clause 30, and managed objects
   defined in this document and in associated MIB modules, i.e., the IF-
   MIB [RFC2863].

   Note that the majority of the objects defined in the EFM-CU-MIB
   module do not have direct counterparts in Clause 30 and instead refer

        DESCRIPTION
          "This table, modeled after ifStackTable from IF-MIB,
          contains information on the possible 'on-top-of'
          relationships between the multiple sub-layers of network
          interfaces (as opposed to actual relationships described in
          ifStackTable).  In particular, it contains information on
          which sub-layers MAY possibly run 'on top of' which other
          sub-layers, as determined by cross-connect capability of the
          device, where each sub-layer corresponds to a conceptual row
          in the ifTable.  For example, when the sub-layer with ifIndex
          value x can be connected to run on top of the sub-layer with
          ifIndex value y, then this table contains:

            ifCapStackStatus.x.y=true

          The ifCapStackStatus.x.y row does not exist if it is
          impossible to connect between the sub-layers x and y.

          Note that for most stacked interfaces (e.g., 2BASE-TL)
          there's always at least one higher-level interface (e.g., PCS
          port) for each lower-level interface (e.g., PME) and at
          least one lower-level interface for each higher-level
          interface, that is, there is at least a single row with a
          'true' status for any such existing value of x or y.

          This table is read-only as it describes device capabilities."

          a higher-layer interface or by the lower-layer interface in
          question being already connected to another higher-layer
          interface.  In order to ensure that a particular sub-layer can
          be connected to another sub-layer, all respective objects

          It is RECOMMENDED that a small debouncing period of 2.5 sec,

          efmCuLowRateCrossing notifications to be sent.

          The adaptive nature of the EFMCu technology allows the port to
          adapt itself to the changes in the copper environment, e.g.,
          an impulse noise, alien crosstalk, or a micro-interruption may
          temporarily drop one or more PMEs in the aggregation group,
          causing a rate degradation of the aggregated EFMCu link.
          The dropped PMEs would then try to re-initialize, possibly at
          a lower rate than before, adjusting the rate to provide

          target, the excess capability SHALL be either converted to
          additional SNR margin or reclaimed by minimizing transmit
          power as controlled by efmCuAdaptiveSpectra.

          The value of 999999 means that the target data rate is not

7.  Security Considerations

   There is a number of managed objects defined in the EFM-CU-MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create.  Most
   objects are writeable only when the link is Down.  Writing to these
   objects can have potentially disruptive effects on network operation,
   for example:

   o  Changing of efmCuPmeAdminSubType may lead to a potential locking
      of the link, as peer PMEs of the same subtype cannot exchange
      handshake messages.

   o  Changing of efmCuPAFAdminState to enabled may lead to a potential
      locking of the link, if the peer PHY does not support PAF.

   o  Changing of efmCuPAFDiscoveryCode, before the discovery operation,
      may lead to a wrongful discovery, for example, when two -O ports
      are connected to the same multi-PME -R port and both -O ports have
      the same Discovery register value.





Beili                       Standards Track                    [Page 84]

RFC 5066                  EFMCu Interfaces MIB             November 2007


   o  Changing PCS or PME configuration parameters (e.g., profile of a
      PCS or PME via efmCuAdminProfile or efmCuPmeAdminProfile) may lead
      to anything from link quality and rate degradation to a complete
      link initialization failure, as ability of an EFMCu port to
      support a particular configuration depends on the copper
      environment.

   o  Activation of a PME can cause a severe degradation of service for
      another EFMCu PHY, whose PME(s) may be affected by the cross-talk
      from the newly activated PME.

   o  Removal of a PME from an operationally 'up' EFMCu port,
      aggregating several PMEs, may cause port's rate degradation.

   The user of the EFM-CU-MIB module must therefore be aware that
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   The readable objects in the EFM-CU-MIB module (i.e., those with MAX-
   ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive in some
   environments since, collectively, they provide information about the
   performance of network interfaces and can reveal some aspects of
   their configuration.  In particular, since EFMCu can be carried over
   Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) voice-grade copper in a bundle with
   other pairs belonging to another operator/customer, it is
   theoretically possible to eavesdrop to an EFMCu transmission simply
   by "listening" to a cross-talk from the EFMCu pairs, especially if
   the parameters of the EFMCu link in question are known.

   In such environments, it is important to control also GET and NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly even to encrypt their values
   when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in these MIB modules.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of these MIB modules is properly configured to give access
   to the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Object identifiers for the efmCuMIB MODULE-IDENTITY and ifCapStackMIB
   MODULE-IDENTITY have been allocated by IANA in the MIB-2 sub-tree.
