1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects to configure and/or
   monitor Multiprotocol Label Switching Layer-3 Virtual Private
   Networks on a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switching
   Router (LSR) supporting this feature.

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms
   described in [RFC4364].  Unless otherwise stated, the mechanisms of
   [RFC4364] apply and will not be re-described here.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS
   architecture [RFC3031] and from the document describing MPLS Layer-3
   VPNs (L3VPN) [RFC4364], as well as the MPLS architecture [RFC3031].

   Throughout this document, the use of the terms "Provider Edge (PE)
   and Customer Edge (CE)" or "PE/CE" will be replaced by "PE" in all
   cases except when a network device is a CE when used in the carrier's
   carrier model.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Assumptions and Prerequisites

   It is assumed that certain things are configured and operational in
   order for the tables and objects described in this MIB to function
   correctly.  These things are outlined below:

   - MPLS in general, must be configured and operational.

   - Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) paths or traffic-engineered
     tunnels [RFC3812] should be configured between PEs and CEs.

5.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

     The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the
     objects contained in the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB.

5.1.  mplsL3VpnVrfTable

     This table represents the MPLS L3VPNs that are configured.  A
     Network Management System (NMS) or SNMP agent creates an entry in
     this table for every MPLS L3VPN configured on the LSR being
     examined.  The Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) that is



Nadeau & van Der Linde      Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 4382                   MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB              February 2006


     configured at a particular device represents an instance of some
     VPN, but not the entire VPN (unless it is the only VRF, of course).
     The collective set of VRF instances comprises the actual VPN.  This
     information is typically only known in its entirety at the NMS.
     That is, specific devices generally only know of their local VRF
     information, but not that of other LSRs' VRFs.

5.2.  mplsL3VpnIfConfTable

     This table represents the MPLS L3VPN-enabled interfaces that are
     associated with a specific VRF as represented in the aforementioned
     mplsL3VpnVrfTable.  Each entry in this table corresponds to an
     entry in the Interfaces MIB.  In addition, each entry extends its
     corresponding entry in the Interfaces MIB to contain specific MPLS
     L3VPN information.  Due to this correspondence, certain objects
     such as traffic counters are not found in this MIB to avoid
     overlap, but instead are found in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].

5.3.  mplsL3VpnVrfPerfTable

     This table contains objects to measure the performance of MPLS
     L3VPNs and augments the mplsL3VpnVrfTable.  High capacity counters
     are provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on
     objects such as high-speed interface counters.

5.4.  mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable

     The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor
     routes used by a particular VRF.  This includes a cross-connect
     pointer into the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB's mplsXCTable, which may be used
     to refer that entry to its label stack used to label switch that
     entry.

5.5.  MplsVpnVrfRTTable

     The table contains the objects necessary to configure and monitor
     route targets for a particular VRF.

6.  Example of MPLS L3VPN Setup

     In this section, we provide a brief example of using the MIB
     objects described in the following section.  While this example is
     not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is intended as
     an aid to understanding some of the key concepts.  It is our intent
     that it is read only after the reader has gone through the MIB
     itself.

     This configuration is under the assumption that 1) MPLS has been
     pre-configured in the network, through enabling LDP or Resource
     Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE); 2) OSPF or
     Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) has been pre-
     configured; and 3) BGP sessions have been established between PEs.

     Defining the VRF, the route target, and route distinguisher:

   In mplsL3VpnVrfTable:
   {
     mplsL3VpnVrfName               = "RED",
     mplsL3VpnVrfDescription        = "Intranet of Company ABC",
     mplsL3VpnVrfRD                 = "100:1", -- octet string
     mplsL3VpnVrfRowStatus          = createAndGo(4)
   }

   In mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable:
   {
     mplsL3VpnVrfRTRowStatus."Red"."100:1".import = createAndGo,
     mplsL3VpnVrfRTRowStatus."Red"."100:1".export = createAndGo

        entry in the mplsXCTable and then set that index to the value
        of this object.  Changes to the cross-connect object in the
        mplsXCTable MUST automatically be reflected in the value of
        this object.  If this object represents a static routing entry,

   DESCRIPTION
       "This notification is generated only after the number of routes
        contained by the specified VRF exceeds or attempts to exceed
        the maximum allowed value as indicated by
        mplsVrfMaxRouteThreshold, and then falls below this value.  The
        emission of this notification informs the operator that the
        error condition has been cleared without the operator having to
        query the device.

        Note that mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime denotes the interval at
        which the mplsNumVrfRouteMaxThreshExceeded notification will
        be reissued after the maximum value has been exceeded (or
        reached if mplsL3VpnVrfConfMaxRoutes and
        mplsL3VpnVrfConfHighRteThresh are equal) and the initial
        notification has been issued.  Therefore,
        the generation of this notification should also be emitted with
        this same frequency (assuming that the error condition is
        cleared).  Specifically, if the error condition is reached and
        cleared several times during the period of time specified in
        mplsL3VpnVrfConfRteMxThrshTime, only a single notification will
        be issued to indicate the first instance of the error condition
        as well as the first time the error condition is cleared.
        This behavior is intended to prevent continuous generation of
        notifications by an agent in the event that routes are
        continually added and removed to/from a VRF after it has
        reached its maximum value.  The default value is 0.  If this
        value is set to 0, the agent should issue a notification
        whenever the maximum threshold has been cleared."

8.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that these MIB modules are potentially useful for
   monitoring of MPLS LSRs supporting L3 MPLS VPN.  This MIB module can
   also be used for configuration of certain objects, and anything that
   can be configured can be incorrectly configured, with potentially
   disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsL3VpnVrfRouteTable, mplsL3VpnIfConfTable, and
        mplsL3VpnVrfTable tables collectively contain objects that may
        be used to provision MPLS VRF interfaces and configuration.
        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables could result in
        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true
        if these VRFs have been previously provisioned and are in use.

RFC 4382                   MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB              February 2006


        The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
        considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM
        MUST be used with any v3 agent that implements this MIB module.
        Administrators should consider whether read access to these
        objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable
        under certain circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsL3VpnVrfTable, mplsL3VpnIfConfTable tables collectively
        show the VRF interfaces and associated VRF configurations as
        well as their linkages to other MPLS-related configuration
        and/or performance statistics.  Administrators not wishing to
        reveal this information should consider these objects
        sensitive/vulnerable and take precautions so they are not
        revealed.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   As described in MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], MPLS related standards
   track MIB modules should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.
   There is one MPLS-related MIB module contained in this document.  The
   following subsection requests IANA for a new assignment under the
   mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards
   Action as specified in [RFC2434].

9.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB

   The IANA has assigned { mplsStdMIB 11 } to the MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB
   module specified in this document.

10. Dedication
