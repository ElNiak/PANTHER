1.  Introduction

   This document defines the formal Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   Namespace Identifier (NID) for EIDR Identifiers.

   EIDR Identifiers are centrally registered, globally unique
   identifiers for audiovisual works and their variants, primarily film
   and television.  A unique set of metadata parameters describing the
   associated work is bound to the EIDR Identifier at the time of
   registration.

   EIDR Identifiers are a special kind of DOI Name allocated by EIDR
   Association specifically for audiovisual works.  The Digital Object
   Identifier (DOI) system provides an infrastructure for persistent
   unique identification of objects of any type and is specified in
   [ISO26234].  A DOI Name is the identifier that is permanently
   assigned to an object.  The use of DOI Names ensures persistence,
   global uniqueness, and an open resolution infrastructure.

   As a DOI Name, an EIDR Identifier has two components: a prefix
   assigned exclusively to EIDR Association by the DOI Registration
   Authority and a suffix defined by EIDR Association.  Currently, EIDR
   Identifiers use the prefix "10.5240", but additional prefixes might
   be introduced in the future.

   The following is an example of an EIDR Identifier in its canonical
   representation:

                   10.5240/7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5

   where "10.5240" is the prefix and "7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5" is the
   suffix.

RFC 7972              EIDR URN Namespace Definition       September 2016


   The canonical URN representation of the same EIDR Identifier is:

                   urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5

   Note that ":" is used as separator between the prefix and the suffix
   since "/" is a URN reserved character.

   [EIDR-OVERVIEW] and [EIDR-INTRO] provide additional background
   information.

   This document obsoletes RFC 7302.  See Appendix A for a summary of
   changes.

RFC 7972              EIDR URN Namespace Definition       September 2016


   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      An EIDR Identifier is a special kind of DOI Name (see [ISO26234])
      and, as such, consists of two components: a prefix denoted EIDR-
      PREFIX and a suffix denoted EIDR-SUFFIX.  The URN representation
      URN-EIDR of an EIDR Identifier conforms to the syntax (expressed
      using [RFC5234]):

                   URN-EIDR = "urn:eidr:" EIDR-NSS
                   EIDR-NSS = EIDR-PREFIX ":" EIDR-SUFFIX
                   EIDR-PREFIX = 1*EIDR-CHARS
                   EIDR-SUFFIX = 1*EIDR-CHARS
                   EIDR-CHARS = ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_"

      The only value of EIDR-PREFIX currently in use is "10.5240".
      Additional prefix values conforming to the EIDR-PREFIX syntax
      might be introduced by EIDR Association in the future.  In all
      cases, each of these additional prefix values will be associated
      with suffix values that conform to a subset of the EIDR-SUFFIX
      syntax.  These additional prefixes and their corresponding
      suffixes will be documented in future revisions to this
      registration.

      An implementation can process an EIDR-NSS with an unknown prefix
      as an opaque string per the "Rules of Lexical Equivalence" below,
      and resolve it as a generic DOI Name per the "Process for
      identifier resolution" below.

      When EIDR-PREFIX is equal to "10.5240", the syntax of EIDR-SUFFIX
      is further constrained according to the RP2079-SUFFIX syntax
      specified in [SMPTERP2079]:

                   RP2079-SUFFIX = 5(4HEXDIG "-") CHECK
                   CHECK         = DIGIT / ALPHA

      where CHECK is the Mod 37,36 check character as specified in
      [ISO7064], computed over the 20 hexadecimal digits HEXDIG of
      RP2079-SUFFIX.

      EXAMPLE: urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      [ISO26234] specifies DOI Name syntax and registration.

      [SMPTERP2079] specifies the syntax of the EIDR Identifier with the
      prefix "10.5240".

RFC 7972              EIDR URN Namespace Definition       September 2016


   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      An EIDR Identifier is a DOI Name.  The ISO 26324 Registration
      Authority ensures DOI Name uniqueness; therefore, the URN-EIDR
      derived from an EIDR Identifier is guaranteed to be unique and
      never reassigned.

      Furthermore, an EIDR Identifier is associated with a single URN-
      EIDR.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      An EIDR Identifier is a DOI Name.  The ISO 26324 Registration
      Authority ensures that a DOI Name remains valid indefinitely;
      therefore, the URN-EIDR derived from an EIDR Identifier remains
      valid indefinitely.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      EIDR Association registers each EIDR Identifier with the ISO 26324
      Registration Authority.

      Entities involved in the motion picture and television industry,
      either directly in the production of content or in its
      distribution and related services, are eligible to apply for
      registrant status.  Registrants pay an annual membership fee that
      depends on the size of the company.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      As a DOI Name, the resolution of the EIDR Identifier associated
      with an EIDR-NSS is handled by the ISO 26324 Registration
      Authority.

      The ISO 26324 Registration Authority operates a web service that
      allows the EIDR Identifier associated with an EIDR-NSS to be
      resolved by issuing an HTTP GET request to the following URI (see
      [RFC7231] and [RFC2818]):

                           "https://doi.org/" URN-EIDR

      If the EIDR Identifier exists, then an XML Schema instance
      document (see [XMLSchema]) containing metadata associated with the
      EIDR Identifier is returned; otherwise, the HTTP status code "404
      Not Found" is returned.

RFC 7972              EIDR URN Namespace Definition       September 2016


   EXAMPLE: https://doi.org/urn:eidr:10.5240:7791-8534-2C23-9030-8610-5

      NOTE: The web service uses the HTTP Accept header to determine the
      format of the response.  When using a web browser to access the
      resource above, the query string "?locatt=type:Full" is appended
      to the URI to explicitly request an XML response.

      EIDR Association operates additional services specifically
      tailored to EIDR users (see [EIDR-SERVICES] and [DOI-EIDR-PROXY]).
      These services include additional features, e.g., the ability to
      register EIDR Identifiers and web-based GUI tools.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      Lexical equivalence of the URN-EIDR is defined by case-insensitive
      string match.

      NOTE: The URN-EIDR includes the "urn:eidr:" string, as specified
      under "Declaration of syntactic structure".

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      As specified above, the syntax of the URN-EIDR is a subset of the
      URN syntax specified in [RFC2141].

   Validation mechanism:

      The validity of an EIDR-NSS can only be guaranteed by completing
      the resolution process.

      For EIDR-NSS with an EIDR-PREFIX equal to "10.5240", the CHECK
      value can be used for integrity checking, as specified above.

   Scope:

      EIDR Identifiers are centrally registered, globally unique
      identifiers for use with audiovisual works worldwide.

3.  Namespace Considerations

   EIDR Identifiers are intended for use in Internet applications, where
   URNs are routinely used to identify audiovisual resources.  There is
   no direct mapping from EIDR Identifiers to existing URN namespaces.

4.  Community Considerations

   The primary registrants of EIDR Identifiers are producers and
   distributors of audiovisual works, metadata aggregators, and
   audiovisual archives.  Any bona fide member of the ecosystem can
   become an EIDR member and register any work.  EIDR Identifiers can be
   used by anyone to unambiguously identify an audiovisual asset and
   retrieve underlying metadata.  The primary benefits of their use are
   associated with works in wide distribution, management of long or
   complex distribution chains, and aggregation of information from
   multiple sources.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the Formal URN Namespace 'eidr' in the "Uniform
   Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry, using the registration
   template in Section 2 of this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the syntax of the URN-EIDR namespace and
   makes no security representations.  Furthermore, the details of
   assignment and resolution processes are defined external to this
   document by EIDR Association and the ISO 26324 Registration
   Authority, and are thus outside the scope of this document.  Note,
   however, that failure to conform to the syntactic and lexical
   equivalence rules in this specification when using an EIDR Identifier
   as a criteria for accessing restricted resources can result in
   granting unauthorized access to these resources.
