          the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2

Abstract

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into configuration information, state information, performance
   information, and notifications.  This additional state and
   performance information is useful for troubleshooting problems and
   performance issues of the routing protocol.  Two levels of compliance
   allow this MIB module to be deployed on constrained routers.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for configuring and managing the Optimized Link State Routing
   Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2).  The OLSRv2-MIB module is structured
   into configuration information, state information, performance
   information, and notifications.  In addition to configuration, this
   additional state and performance information is useful for
   troubleshooting problems and performance issues of the routing
   protocol.  Different levels of compliance allow implementers to use
   smaller subsets of all defined objects, allowing for this MIB module
   to be deployed on more constrained routers.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB module are defined using the mechanisms defined in
   the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This document
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in STD 58, [RFC2578], STD 58, [RFC2579] and STD 58
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)
   [RFC7181] is a table-driven, proactive routing protocol, i.e., it
   exchanges topology information with other routers in the network
   periodically.  OLSRv2 is an optimization of the classical link state
   routing protocol.  Its key concept is that of multipoint relays
   (MPRs).  Each router selects a set of its neighbor routers (which
   "cover" all of its symmetrically connected 2-hop neighbor routers) as
   MPRs.  MPRs are then used to achieve both flooding reduction and
   topology reduction.

   This document provides management and control capabilities of an
   OLSRv2 instance, allowing management applications to monitor the
   state and performance of an OLSRv2 router, as well as to change
   settings of the OLSRv2 instance (e.g., router or interface parameters
   such as message intervals, etc.).

   As OLSRv2 relies on the neighborhood information discovered by the
   "Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol
   (NHDP)" [RFC6130], the OLSRv2-MIB module is aligned with the NHDP-MIB
   module [RFC6779] and augments several of the tables and objects in
   the NHDP-MIB.  In particular, common indexes for router interfaces
   and discovered neighbors are used, as described in Section 5.2.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, and objects that are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values that define the
      current operating state of the OLSRv2 protocol instance in the
      router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values that help an
      administrator or automated tool to assess the performance of the
      OLSRv2 process on the router.

   o  Notification Objects - objects that define triggers and associated
      notification messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of
      predefined events on the managed router.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the OLSRv2-MIB module.  The
   objects are arranged into the following structure:

   o  olsrv2MIBObjects - defines objects forming the basis for the
      OLSRv2-MIB module.  These objects are divided up by function into
      the following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the OLSRv2 instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects that reflect the current state
         of the OLSRv2 instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group - defining objects that are useful to a
         management system when characterizing the performance of OLSRv2
         on the router and in the MANET.

   o  olsrv2MIBNotifications - objects defining OLSRv2-MIB module
      notifications.

   o  olsrv2MIBConformance - defining the minimal and maximal
      conformance requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


5.1.  The Configuration Group

   The OLSRv2 router is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the OLSRv2-MIB
   module is found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the OLSRv2-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [RFC7181].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of
   these parameters as defined in [RFC7181] are followed.

5.2.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   [RFC7181].  The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables were designed to
   contain the complete set of state information defined within the
   Information Bases in [RFC7181].

   The OLSRv2-MIB module State Group tables are constructed as
   extensions to the corresponding tables within the State Group of the
   NHDP-MIB module [RFC6779].  Use of the AUGMENTS clause is made, when
   possible, to accomplish these table extensions.  Further, the State
   Group tables defined in this MIB module are aligned with the
   corresponding tables in the NHDP-MIB module [RFC6779], as described
   in Section 6.2.

5.3.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   Frequent changes of sets or frequent recalculation of the Routing Set
   or the MPRs can have a negative influence on the performance of
   OLSRv2.  This MIB module defines several objects that can be polled,
   e.g., in order to calculate histories or monitor frequencies of
   changes.  This may help the network administrator to determine
   unusual topology changes or other changes that affect stability and
   reliability of the MANET.  One such framework is specified in REPORT-
   MIB [REPORT-MIB].

5.4.  The Notifications Group

   The Notifications Group contains Control
   (olsrv2NotificationsControl), Objects (olsrv2NotificationsObjects),
   and States (olsrv2NotificationsStates), where the Control contains
   definitions of objects to control the frequency of notifications
   being generated.  The Objects define the supported notifications, and
   the State is used to define additional information to be carried
   within the notifications.

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


   The olsrv2NotificationsObjects sub-tree contains the list of
   notifications supported within the OLSRv2-MIB module and their
   intended purpose or utility.

   The same mechanisms for improving the network performance by reducing
   the number of notifications apply as defined in Section 5.1 of
   [RFC6779].  The following objects are used to define the thresholds
   and time windows for specific notifications defined in the NHDP-MIB
   module: olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold,
   olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountWindow,
   olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountThreshold, and
   olsrv2MPRSetRecalculationCountWindow.

5.5.  Tables and Indexing

   The OLSRv2-MIB module's tables are indexed by the following
   constructs:

   o  nhdpIfIndex - the ifIndex of the local router on which NHDP is
      configured.  This is defined in the NHDP-MIB.

   o  nhdpDiscIfIndex - a locally managed index representing a known
      interface on a neighboring router.  This is defined in the NHDP-
      MIB.

   o  nhdpDiscRouterIndex - a locally managed index representing an ID
      of a known neighboring router.  This is defined in the NHDP-MIB.

   o  {olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddr} - this index
      (pair) uniquely identifies recently used originator addresses
      found within the olsrv2LibOrigSetTable.

   o  {olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddr,
      olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrPrefixLen} - this index (triplet)
      uniquely identifies local attached networks reachable through
      local (non-OLSRv2) interfaces on this router.  These are recorded
      in the olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetTable.

   o  {olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr} - this index (pair) uniquely
      identifies each router in the network that transmits Topology
      Control (TC) messages received by this router.  These records are
      recorded in the olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr.

   o  {olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr} - this index (quadruplet)



Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


      uniquely identifies discovered links within the network recorded
      by this router.  Information associated with each link is stored
      in the olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable.

   o  {olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddr} - this index
      (quadruplet) uniquely identifies reachable addresses within the
      network and the router's advertising of these addresses.  This
      information is stored in the
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetTable.

   o  {olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrPrefixLen} - this index
      (quintuplet) uniquely identifies the networks (which may be
      outside the MANET) and the routers through which these networks
      can be reached.  This information is stored in the
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetTable.

   o  {olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrType, olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrPrefixLen} - this index (triplet)
      uniquely identifies the address of a reachable destination in the
      network.  This indexes the olsrv2TibRoutingSetTable, which
      contains the next-hop information to reach the indexed addresses.

   These tables and their indexing are:

   o  olsrv2InterfaceTable - describes the OLSRv2 status on the NHDP
      interfaces of this router.  This table augments nhdpInterfaceEntry
      and, as such, it is indexed by the {nhdpIfIndex} from the NHDP-
      MIB.

   o  olsrv2IibLinkSetTable - records all links from other routers that
      are, or recently were, 1-hop neighbors.  This table augments
      nhdpIibLinkSetEntry and, as such, it is indexed by nhdpIfIndex and
      nhdpDiscIfIndex.

   o  olsrv2Iib2HopSetTable - records network addresses of symmetric
      2-hop neighbors and the links to the associated 1-hop neighbors.
      This table augments nhdpIib2HopSetEntry and, as such, it is
      indexed by {nhdpIfIndex, nhdpDiscIfIndex,
      nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddressType, nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddress}.

   o  olsrv2LibOrigSetTable - records addresses that were recently used
      as originator addresses by this router.  This table is indexed by
      {olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddrType, olsrv2LibOrigSetIpAddr}.

   o  olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetTable - records its local non-OLSRv2
      interfaces via which it can act as a gateway to other networks.
      This table is indexed by {olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddr,
      olsrv2LibLocAttNetSetIpAddrPrefixLen}.

   o  olsrv2NibNeighborSetTable - records all network addresses of each
      1-hop neighbor.  This table augments nhdpNibNeighborSetEntry and,
      as such, it is indexed by the {nhdpDiscRouterIndex}.

   o  olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetTable - records information describing
      each remote router in the network that transmits TC messages.
      This table is indexed by {olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr}.

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - records topology information
      about the network.  This table is indexed by
      {olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr}.

   o  olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetTable - records topology
      information about the routable addresses within the MANET and via
      which routers they may be reached.  This table is indexed by
      {olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutableAddressTopologySetFromDestIpAddr}.

   o  olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetTable - records information about networks
      (which may be outside the MANET) attached to other routers and
      their routable addresses.  This table is indexed by
      {olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetNetIpAddrPrefixLen}.

   o  olsrv2TibRoutingSetTable - records the first hop along a selected
      path to each destination for which any such path is known.  This
      table is indexed by {olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrType,
      olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddr,
      olsrv2TibRoutingSetDestIpAddrPrefixLen}.

   o  olsrv2InterfacePerfTable - records performance counters for each
      active OLSRv2 interface on this device.  This table augments
      nhdpInterfacePerfEntry and, as such, it is indexed by
      {nhdpIfIndex} from the NHDP-MIB.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB modules contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  MIB modules and specific definitions
   imported from MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction
   with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in
   this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The System group in the SNMPv2-MIB module [RFC3418] is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The System group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The OLSRv2-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to the NHDP-MIB

   OLSRv2 depends on the neighborhood information that is discovered by
   [RFC6130].  An instance of OLSRv2 MUST have an associated instance of
   NHDP running on the same device for proper operations of the
   discovery and routing system.  In order for the OLSRv2-MIB module to
   correctly populate the objects relating to discovered neighbors, the
   State Group tables of the NHDP-MIB module [RFC6779] are aligned with
   the State Group tables of this MIB module.  This is accomplished
   through the use of the AUGMENTS capability of SMIv2 (where
   appropriate).  This will allow for cross referencing of information
   between the two MIB modules within a given SNMP context.

6.3.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The following OLSRv2-MIB module IMPORTS objects from NHDP-MIB
   [RFC6779], SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF
   [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], and INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001].  The
   OLSRv2-MIB module also IMPORTS objects from the
   IANAolsrv2LinkMetricType-MIB, which is available at <http://
   www.iana.org/assignments/ianaolsrv2linkmetrictype-mib>.

Olsrv2MetricValueCompressedFormTC ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   DISPLAY-HINT "d"
   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
      "OLSRv2 Metrics are expressed in terms of a Link Metric
       Compressed Form within the OLSRv2 protocol.  This textual
       convention defines the syntax of the metric objects
       consistent with the definitions of the OLSRv2 Link
       Metric Compressed Form in Section 6.2 of RFC 7181.

       The 12-bit compressed form of a link metric uses a modified
       form of a representation with an 8-bit mantissa (denoted a)
       and a 4-bit exponent (denoted b).  Note that if represented
       as the 12-bit value 256b+a, then the ordering of those 12-bit
       values is identical to the ordering of the represented values.

       The value so represented is (257+a)2^b - 256, where ^ denotes
       exponentiation.  This has a minimum value
       (when a = 0 and b = 0) of MINIMUM_METRIC = 1 and a maximum
       value (when a = 255 and b = 15) of MAXIMUM_METRIC = 2^24 - 256.

       Hence, the metric values so represented range from 1 to
       16776960.  The special value of 0 is reserved for the
       UNKNOWN_METRIC value.

       If a network manager sets the metric value 'm' through the
       MIB module, then the OLSRv2 code can both use this value
       and derive a compressed representation of 'm' (as used in
       messages) as specified in Section 6.2 of RFC7181.
       The value 'm' is persistently stored by the MIB module.
       If the MIB module is pulling this metric's value from some other
       source, e.g., the protocol instance, then this value is stored
       as is."

Olsrv2TimeValueCompressedForm32TC ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

   STATUS      current
   DESCRIPTION
      "OLSRv2 time values may be expressed in terms of a compressed
       form within the OLSRv2 protocol.  This textual convention
       defines the syntax of the time objects defined in terms of
       an integer number of milliseconds, consistent with the
       definitions of the 8-bit exponent-mantissa compressed form

       defined in Section 5 of RFC 5497.  Time values with this
       representation are defined in terms of a constant C, which
       is represented in terms of seconds.  The constant C
       (time granularity) is used as specified in RFC 5497.
       It MUST be the same as is used by NHDP (RFC 6130).

       The 8-bit compressed form of a time value uses a modified
       form of a representation with a 3-bit mantissa (denoted a)
       and a 5-bit exponent (denoted b).  Note that if represented
       as the 8-bit value 8b+a, then the ordering of those 8-bit
       values is identical to the ordering of the represented values.

       The minimum time value that can be represented in this manner
       is C.  The maximum time value that can be represented in
       this manner is 15 * 2^28 * C, 15*268,435,456 * C,
       4,026,531,840 * C, or about 45 days if, for example,
       C = 1/1024 second.

       This TEXTUAL-CONVENTION limits the maximum value of the
       time granularity constant C to be no greater than 1/1024
       seconds due to its use of the Unsigned32 syntax limiting
       the maximum number of milliseconds to no more than
       3932160000.

       When OLSRv2 uses this 8-bit exponent-mantissa compressed
       form, this object value MUST be translated from the
       integer form represented in this MIB module into the
       exponent-mantissa form for the OLSRv2 protocol to use
       according to the algorithm defined in Section 5 of
       RFC 5497 for finding the next larger time value within
       the exponent-mantissa format.

       If a network manager sets the time value 't' through the
       MIB module, then the OLSRv2 code can derive
       'compressed_t' = T(a,b) according to the algorithm
       in RFC 5497 and 'compressed_t' is the value represented
       in the OLSRv2 messages.  But, the value 't' is persistently
       stored by the MIB module.  If the MIB module is pulling
       this time parameter from some other source that is using
       the compressed form, i.e., the protocol instance, then
       this value is stored as is, after converting from
       number of time constants C into number of milliseconds."

          olsrv2TibAdRemoteRouterSetIpAddr.

          Sequence numbers are used in the OLSRv2 protocol
          for the purpose of discarding 'old' information,
          i.e., messages received out of order.  However,
          with a limited number of bits for representing
          sequence numbers, wraparound (that the sequence
          number is incremented from the maximum possible
          value to zero) will occur.  To prevent this from
          interfering with the operation of this protocol,
          OLSRv2 implementations observe the following when
          determining the ordering of sequence numbers.

          In OLSRv2, MAXVALUE designates one more than the
          largest possible value for a sequence number.

          Sequence numbers are used in the OLSRv2 protocol
          for the purpose of discarding 'old' information,
          i.e., messages received out of order.  However,
          with a limited number of bits for representing
          sequence numbers, wraparound (that the sequence
          number is incremented from the maximum possible
          value to zero) will occur.  To prevent this from
          interfering with the operation of this protocol,
          OLSRv2 implementations observe the following when
          determining the ordering of sequence numbers.

          In OLSRv2, MAXVALUE designates one more than the
          largest possible value for a sequence number.
          For a 16-bit sequence number, MAXVALUE is 65536.

          The sequence number S1 is said to be 'greater than'
          the sequence number S2 if:

          Number (ANSN) in any TC message received
          that originated from the router
          with originator address AN_orig_addr
          (i.e., that contributed to the information
          contained in this Tuple).  The AN_orig_addr
          is defined by the tuple
             (olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddrType,
              olsrv2TibAttNetworksSetOrigIpAddr).

          Sequence numbers are used in the OLSRv2 protocol
          for the purpose of discarding 'old' information,
          i.e., messages received out of order.  However,
          with a limited number of bits for representing
          sequence numbers, wraparound (that the sequence
          number is incremented from the maximum possible
          value to zero) will occur.  To prevent this from
          interfering with the operation of this protocol,
          the following MUST be observed when determining
          the ordering of sequence numbers.

          The term MAXVALUE designates in the following one
          more than the largest possible value for a sequence
          number.  For a 16-bit sequence number (as are those
          defined in this specification), MAXVALUE is 65536.

          The sequence number S1 is said to be 'greater than'
          the sequence number S2 if:

             o  S1 > S2 AND S1 - S2 < MAXVALUE/2 OR

             o  S2 > S1 AND S2 - S1 > MAXVALUE/2

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


          When sequence numbers S1 and S2 differ by MAXVALUE/2,
          their ordering cannot be determined.  In this case,
          which should not occur, either ordering may be
          assumed.

          Thus, when comparing two messages, it is possible
          - even in the presence of wraparound - to determine
          which message contains the most recent information."

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring,
   and notification of the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version
   2 (OLSRv2) [RFC7181].  OLSRv2 allows routers to acquire topological
   information of the routing domain by exchanging TC messages in order
   to calculate shortest paths to each destination router in the routing
   domain.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure



Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 77]

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TcInterval, olsrv2TcMinInterval - these writable objects
      control the rate at which TC messages are sent.  If set at too
      high a rate, this could represent a form of a DoS attack by
      overloading interface resources.  If set too low, OLSRv2 may not
      converge fast enough to provide accurate routes to all
      destinations in the routing domain.

   o  olsrv2TcHopLimit - defines the hop limit for TC messages.  If set
      too low, messages will not be forwarded beyond the defined scope;
      thus, routers further away from the message originator will not be
      able to construct appropriate topology graphs.

   o  olsrv2OHoldTime, olsrv2THoldTime, olsrv2AHoldTime,
      olsrv2RxHoldTime, olsrv2PHoldTime, olsrv2FHoldTime - define hold
      times for tuples of different Information Bases of OLSRv2.  If set
      too low, information will expire quickly, and may this harm a
      correct operation of the routing protocol.

   o  olsrv2WillFlooding and olsrv2WillRouting - define the willingness
      of this router to become MPR.  If this is set to WILL_NEVER (0),
      the managed router will not forward any TC messages, nor accept a
      selection to become MPR by neighboring routers.  If set to
      WILL_ALWAYS (15), the router will be preferred by neighbors during
      MPR selection and may thus attract more traffic.

   o  olsrv2TpMaxJitter, olsrv2TtMaxJitter, olsrv2FMaxJitter - define
      jitter values for TC message transmission and forwarding.  If set
      too low, control traffic may get lost when collisions occur.

   o  olsrv2LinkMetricType - defines the type of the link metric that a
      router uses (e.g., ETX or hop count).  Whenever this value
      changes, all link metric information recorded by the router is
      invalid, causing a reset of information acquired from other
      routers in the MANET.  Moreover, if olsrv2LinkMetricType on a
      router is set to a value that is not known to other routers in the
      MANET, these routers will not be able to establish routes to that
      router or transiting that router.  Existing routes to the router
      with an olsrv2LinkMetricType unknown to other routers in the MANET
      will be removed.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly



Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 78]

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetTable - The contains information on the
      topology of the MANET, specifically the IP address of the routers
      in the MANET (as identified by
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetFromOrigIpAddr and
      olsrv2TibRouterTopologySetToOrigIpAddr objects).  This information
      provides an adversary broad information on the members of the
      MANET, located within this single table.  This information can be
      used to expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without
      having to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.

   Some of the Tables in this MIB module AUGMENT Tables defined in NHDP-
   MIB [RFC6779].  Hence, care must be taken in configuring access
   control here in order make sure that the permitted permissions
   granted for the AUGMENTing Tables here are consistent with the access
   controls permitted within the NHDP-MIB.  The below list identifies
   the AUGMENTing Tables and their NHDP-MIB counterparts.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that access control policies for these Table pairs are
   consistently set.

   o  The olsrv2InterfaceTable AUGMENTs the nhdpInterfaceTable.

   o  The olsrv2IibLinkSetTable AUGMENTs the nhdpIibLinkSetTable.

   o  The olsrv2Iib2HopSetTable AUGMENTs the nhdpIib2HopSetTable.

   o  The olsrv2NibNeighborSetTable AUGMENTs the
      nhdpNibNeighborSetTable.

   o  The olsrv2InterfacePerfTable AUGMENTs the nhdpInterfacePerfTable.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, when implementing these
   capabilities, the full use of SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms for
   authentication and privacy is RECOMMENDED.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.




Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 79]

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) [RFC7181]
   process on a router.  This MIB module, denoted OLSRv2-MIB, also
   reports state, performance information, and notifications.  The
   OLSRv2 protocol relies upon information gathered via the Neighborhood
   Discovery Protocol [RFC6130] in order to perform its operations.
   NHDP is managed via the NHDP-MIB [RFC6779].

   MANET deployments can greatly differ in aspects of dynamics of the
   topology, capacity, and loss rates of underlying channels, traffic
   flow directions, memory and CPU capacity of routers, etc.  SNMP, and
   therefore this MIB module, are only applicable for a subset of MANET
   deployments, in particular deployments:

   o  In which routers have enough memory and CPU resources to run SNMP
      and expose the MIB module.

   o  Where a Network Management System (NMS) is defined to which
      notifications are generated and from which routers can be managed.

   o  Where this NMS is reachable from routers in the MANET most of the
      time (as notifications to the NMS and management information from
      the NMS to the router will be lost when connectivity is
      temporarily lost).  This requires that the topology of the MANET
      is only moderately dynamic.

   o  Where the underlying wireless channel supports enough bandwidth to
      run SNMP, and where loss rates of the channel are not exhaustive.




Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 80]

RFC 7184                     The OLSRv2-MIB                   April 2014


   Certain MANET deployments such as community networks with non-mobile
   routers, dynamic topology because of changing link quality, and a
   predefined gateway (that could also serve as NMS), are examples of
   networks applicable for this MIB module.  Other, more constrained
   deployments of MANETs may not be able to run SNMP and require
   different management protocols.

   Some level of configuration, i.e., read-write objects, is desirable
   for OLSRv2 deployments.  Topology-related configuration, such as the
   ability to enable OLSRv2 on new interfaces or initially configure
   OLSRv2 on a router's interfaces through the
   olsrv2InterfaceAdminStatus object, is critical to initial system
   startup.  The OLSRv2 protocol allows for some level of performance
   tuning through various protocol parameters, and this MIB module
   allows for configuration of those protocol parameters through read-
   write objects such as the olsrv2TcHopLimit or the olsrv2FMaxJitter.
   Other read-write objects allow for the control of Notification
   behavior through this MIB module, e.g., the
   olsrv2RoutingSetRecalculationCountThreshold object.  A fuller
   discussion of MANET network management applicability is to be
   provided elsewhere: [MGMT-SNAP] provides a snapshot of OLSRv2-routed
   MANET management as currently deployed, while [MANET-MGMT] is
   intended to provide specific guidelines on MANET network management
   considering the various MIB modules that have been written.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA now maintains the IANAolsrv2LinkMetricType-MIB and keeps it
   synchronized with the "LINK_METRIC Address Block TLV Type Extensions"
   registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters>.

   The MIB modules in this document use the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

Appendix A.  IANAolsrv2LinkMetricType-MIB

   This document has set up the IANAolsrv2LinkMetricType-MIB module.
   IANA now maintains the IANAolsrv2LinkMetricType-MIB and keeps it
   synchronized with the "LINK_METRIC Address Block TLV Type Extensions"
   registry at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters>.  The
   IANA site is the definitive source for this MIB should there be any
   discrepancies (e.g., future updates to the MIB).

          LINK_METRIC_TYPE of OLSRv2 (RFC 7181).
          OLSRv2 uses bidirectional additive link metrics
          to determine shortest distance routes (i.e.,
          routes with smallest total of link metric values).

          OLSRv2 has established a registry for the LINK_METRIC_TYPEs
          (denoted 'LINK_METRIC Address Block TLV Type Extensions'):
                 http://www.iana.org/assignments/manet-parameters/

          This is done in Section 24.5 in OLSRv2 (RFC 7181).
          The LINK_METRIC_TYPE (which has as corresponding
          object in the MIB module olsrv2LinkMetricType)
          corresponds to the type extension of
          the LINK_METRIC TLV that is set up in the
          'LINK_METRIC Address Block TLV Type Extensions' registry.
          Whenever new link metric types are added to that registry,
          IANA MUST update this textual convention accordingly.

          The definition of this textual convention with the
          addition of newly assigned values is published
          periodically by the IANA, in either the Assigned
          Numbers RFC, or some derivative of it specific to
          Internet Network Management number assignments.  (The
          latest arrangements can be obtained by contacting the
          IANA.)

          Requests for new values should be made to IANA via
          email (iana@iana.org)."
