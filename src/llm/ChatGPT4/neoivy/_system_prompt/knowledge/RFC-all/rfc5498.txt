Abstract

   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by
   Mobile Ad hoc NETwork (MANET) protocols.  The following well-known
   numbers are required: a UDP port number, an IP protocol number, and a
   link-local multicast group address.

1.  Introduction

   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by
   one or more protocols that conform to [RFC5444].  The following
   well-known numbers are required: a UDP port number, an IP protocol
   number, and a link-local multicast group address.  All interoperable
   protocols running on these well-known IANA allocations MUST conform
   to [RFC5444].  [RFC5444] provides a common format that enables one or
   more protocols to share the IANA allocations defined in this document
   unambiguously.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  UDP Port Number

   MANET routers require a well-known UDP port number [IANA] to send and
   receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The title of this UDP port
   is "manet".  The value of this UDP port is 269.

4.  IP Protocol Number

   MANET routers require a well-known IP protocol number [IANA] to send
   and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The title of this IP
   protocol number is "manet".  The value of this IP protocol number is
   138.

5.  Link-Local Multicast Group for MANET Routers

   MANET routers require a well-known, link-local multicast address
   [RFC4291] to send and receive MANET routing protocol packets.  The
   name of the multicast address to reach link-local (LL) MANET routers
   is "LL-MANET-Routers".

   For IPv4, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is
   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers is 224.0.0.109.

   For IPv6, a well-known, link-local scope multicast address is
   required.  The address for LL-MANET-Routers is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:6D.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document enumerates several common IANA allocations for use by
   one or more protocols that conform to [RFC5444].  Specifically, the
   following well-known numbers have been assigned: a UDP port
   (Section 3), an IP protocol number (Section 4), and a link-local
   multicast group address (Section 5).

   Action 1:

      IANA has made the following assignments in the "PORT NUMBERS"
      registry:

      sub-registry "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS"

      Keyword Decimal Description     References
      ------- ------- -----------     ----------
      manet   269/udp MANET Protocols [RFC5498]

   Action 2:

      IANA has made the following assignments in the "PROTOCOL NUMBERS"
      registry:

      sub-registry "WELL KNOWN PORT NUMBERS"

      Keyword Decimal Description     References
      ------- ------- -----------     ----------
      manet   138     MANET Protocols [RFC5498]

RFC 5498          IANA Allocations for MANET Protocols        March 2009


   Action 3:

      IANA has made the following assignments in the "Internet Multicast
      Addresses" registry:

      sub-registry "224.0.0.0 - 224.0.0.255 (224.0.0/24) Local Network
      Control Block"

      224.0.0.109 LL-MANET-Routers   [RFC5498]

   Action 4:

      IANA has made the following assignments in the "INTERNET PROTOCOL
      VERSION 6 MULTICAST ADDRESSES" registry:

      sub-registry "Fixed Scope Multicast Addresses"

      sub-sub-registry "Link-Local Scope"

      FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:6D LL-MANET-Routers [RFC5498]

7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies only well-known numbers for protocols that
   conform to [RFC5444], and it not does not specify the protocols that
   carry the information across the network.  Each protocol using these
   well-known numbers may have its own set of security issues, but those
   issues are not affected by using the IANA allocations specified
   herein.

   The security issues associated with possibly operating multiple
   cooperating protocols using the same IANA assignments (e.g., UDP
   port) MUST be addressed in each protocol's specification.

8.  Acknowledgements

   Fred Templin, Bill Fenner, Alexandru Petrescu, Sam Weiler, Ross
   Callon, and Lars Eggert provided valuable input to this document.
