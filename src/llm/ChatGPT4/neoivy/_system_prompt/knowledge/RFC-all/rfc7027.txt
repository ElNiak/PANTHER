1.  Introduction

   [RFC5639] specifies a new set of elliptic curve groups over finite
   prime fields for use in cryptographic applications.  These groups,
   denoted as ECC Brainpool curves, were generated in a verifiably
   pseudo-random way and comply with the security requirements of
   relevant standards from ISO [ISO1] [ISO2], ANSI [ANSI1], NIST [FIPS],
   and SecG [SEC2].

   [RFC4492] defines the usage of elliptic curves for authentication and
   key agreement in TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1; these mechanisms may also be
   used with TLS 1.2 [RFC5246].  While the ASN.1 object identifiers
   defined in [RFC5639] already allow usage of the ECC Brainpool curves
   for TLS (client or server) authentication through reference in X.509
   certificates according to [RFC3279] and [RFC5480], their negotiation
   for key exchange according to [RFC4492] requires the definition and
   assignment of additional NamedCurve IDs.  This document specifies
   such values for three curves from [RFC5639].

2.  Brainpool NamedCurve Types

   According to [RFC4492], the name space NamedCurve is used for the
   negotiation of elliptic curve groups for key exchange during a
   handshake starting a new TLS session.  This document adds new
   NamedCurve types to three elliptic curves defined in [RFC5639] as
   follows:

           enum {
                brainpoolP256r1(26),
                brainpoolP384r1(27),
                brainpoolP512r1(28)
           } NamedCurve;

   These curves are suitable for use with Datagram TLS [RFC6347].

   Test vectors for a Diffie-Hellman key exchange using these elliptic
   curves are provided in Appendix A.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned numbers for the ECC Brainpool curves listed in
   Section 2 in the "EC Named Curve" [IANA-TLS] registry of the
   "Transport Layer Security (TLS) Parameters" registry as follows:

             +-------+-----------------+---------+-----------+
             | Value |   Description   | DTLS-OK | Reference |
             +-------+-----------------+---------+-----------+
             |   26  | brainpoolP256r1 |    Y    |  RFC 7027 |
             |   27  | brainpoolP384r1 |    Y    |  RFC 7027 |
             |   28  | brainpoolP512r1 |    Y    |  RFC 7027 |
             +-------+-----------------+---------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC5246] apply to the ECC Brainpool
   curves described in this document.

   The confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the TLS
   communication is limited by the weakest cryptographic primitive
   applied.  In order to achieve a maximum security level when using one
   of the elliptic curves from Table 1 for authentication and/or key
   exchange in TLS, the key derivation function; the algorithms and key
   lengths of symmetric encryption; and message authentication (as well
   as the algorithm, bit length, and hash function used for signature
   generation) should be chosen according to the recommendations of
   [NIST800-57] and [RFC5639].  Furthermore, the private Diffie-Hellman
   keys should be selected with the same bit length as the order of the
   group generated by the base point G and with approximately maximum
   entropy.

   Implementations of elliptic curve cryptography for TLS may be
   susceptible to side-channel attacks.  Particular care should be taken
   for implementations that internally transform curve points to points
   on the corresponding "twisted curve", using the map (x',y') = (x*Z^2,
   y*Z^3) with the coefficient Z specified for that curve in [RFC5639],
   in order to take advantage of an efficient arithmetic based on the
   twisted curve's special parameters (A = -3).  Although the twisted
   curve itself offers the same level of security as the corresponding
   random curve (through mathematical equivalence), an arithmetic based
   on small curve parameters may be harder to protect against side-

   channel attacks.  General guidance on resistance of elliptic curve
   cryptography implementations against side-channel-attacks is given in
   [BSI1] and [HMV].

Appendix A.  Test Vectors

   This section provides some test vectors for example Diffie-Hellman
   key exchanges using each of the curves defined in Table 1.  The
   following notation is used in the subsequent sections:

      d_A: the secret key of party A

      x_qA: the x-coordinate of the public key of party A

      y_qA: the y-coordinate of the public key of party A

      d_B: the secret key of party B

      x_qB: the x-coordinate of the public key of party B

      y_qB: the y-coordinate of the public key of party B

      x_Z: the x-coordinate of the shared secret that results from
      completion of the Diffie-Hellman computation, i.e., the hex
      representation of the pre-master secret

      y_Z: the y-coordinate of the shared secret that results from
      completion of the Diffie-Hellman computation

   The field elements x_qA, y_qA, x_qB, y_qB, x_Z, and y_Z are
   represented as hexadecimal values using the FieldElement-to-
   OctetString conversion method specified in [SEC1].
