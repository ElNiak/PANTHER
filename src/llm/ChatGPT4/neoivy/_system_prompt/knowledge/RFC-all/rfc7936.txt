1.  Introduction

   Section 11.5 of [RFC6455] sets up a WebSocket Subprotocol Name
   Registry at IANA and directs IANA to use First Come First Serve
   registration procedures as set out in [RFC5226].  The reuse of this
   registry by other protocols has indicated that some clarification of
   the instructions to IANA would be useful.

2.  Clarified Instructions

   The tokens registered in the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry
   created by Section 11.5 of RFC 6455 are matched using case-sensitive
   string match.  IANA is, however, instructed to decline registrations
   in the registry which differ only as to case, in order to minimize
   potential confusion among different registered versions.  For other
   useful advice on avoiding collision, registrants are encouraged to
   consult the non-normative Section 1.9 of RFC 6455.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an update to registry policy, not a protocol.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document is, in its entirety, a clarification of the registry
   policy for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.  As part of this
   clarification, IANA has listed both this document and RFC 6455 as
   references for the WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry.  In addition,
   IANA has included the following note under the registry's
   Registration Procedures: "Please see Section 2 of RFC 7936, which
   clarifies that registrations which differ from existing registrations
   only by case will be refused."
