Abstract

   The purpose of this document is to make the SHA-1 (Secure Hash
   Algorithm 1) hash algorithm conveniently available to the Internet
   community.  The United States of America has adopted the SHA-1 hash
   algorithm described herein as a Federal Information Processing
   Standard.  Most of the text herein was taken by the authors from FIPS
   180-1.  Only the C code implementation is "original".

Acknowledgements

   Most of the text herein was taken from [FIPS 180-1].  Only the C code
   implementation is "original" but its style is similar to the
   previously published MD4 and MD5 RFCs [RFCs 1320, 1321].

   The SHA-1 is based on principles similar to those used by Professor
   Ronald L. Rivest of MIT when designing the MD4 message digest
   algorithm [MD4] and is modeled after that algorithm [RFC 1320].

   Useful comments from the following, which have been incorporated
   herein, are gratefully acknowledged:

1. Overview of Contents

   NOTE: The text below is mostly taken from [FIPS 180-1] and assertions
   therein of the security of SHA-1 are made by the US Government, the
   author of [FIPS 180-1], and not by the authors of this document.

   This document specifies a Secure Hash Algorithm, SHA-1, for computing
   a condensed representation of a message or a data file.  When a
   message of any length < 2^64 bits is input, the SHA-1 produces a
   160-bit output called a message digest.  The message digest can then,
   for example, be input to a signature algorithm which generates or
   verifies the signature for the message.  Signing the message digest
   rather than the message often improves the efficiency of the process
   because the message digest is usually much smaller in size than the
   message.  The same hash algorithm must be used by the verifier of a
   digital signature as was used by the creator of the digital
   signature.  Any change to the message in transit will, with very high
   probability, result in a different message digest, and the signature
   will fail to verify.

   The SHA-1 is called secure because it is computationally infeasible
   to find a message which corresponds to a given message digest, or to
   find two different messages which produce the same message digest.
   Any change to a message in transit will, with very high probability,
   result in a different message digest, and the signature will fail to
   verify.

   Section 2 below defines the terminology and functions used as
   building blocks to form SHA-1.

2. Definitions of Bit Strings and Integers

   The following terminology related to bit strings and integers will be
   used:

   a. A hex digit is an element of the set {0, 1, ... , 9, A, ... , F}.
      A hex digit is the representation of a 4-bit string.  Examples:  7
      = 0111, A = 1010.

   b. A word equals a 32-bit string which may be represented as a
      sequence of 8 hex digits.  To convert a word to 8 hex digits each
      4-bit string is converted to its hex equivalent as described in
      (a) above.  Example:

      1010 0001 0000 0011 1111 1110 0010 0011 = A103FE23.

   c. An integer between 0 and 2^32 - 1 inclusive may be represented as
      a word.  The least significant four bits of the integer are
      represented by the right-most hex digit of the word
      representation.  Example: the integer 291 = 2^8+2^5+2^1+2^0 =
      256+32+2+1 is represented by the hex word, 00000123.

      If z is an integer, 0 <= z < 2^64, then z = (2^32)x + y where 0 <=
      x < 2^32 and 0 <= y < 2^32.  Since x and y can be represented as
      words X and Y, respectively, z can be represented as the pair of
      words (X,Y).

   d. block = 512-bit string.  A block (e.g., B) may be represented as a
      sequence of 16 words.

3. Operations on Words

   The following logical operators will be applied to words:

   a. Bitwise logical word operations

      X AND Y  =  bitwise logical "and" of  X and Y.

      X OR Y   =  bitwise logical "inclusive-or" of X and Y.

      X XOR Y  =  bitwise logical "exclusive-or" of X and Y.

      NOT X    =  bitwise logical "complement" of X.

RFC 3174           US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1)      September 2001


      Example:

               01101100101110011101001001111011
         XOR   01100101110000010110100110110111
               --------------------------------
           =   00001001011110001011101111001100

   b. The operation X + Y is defined as follows:  words X and Y
      represent integers x and y, where 0 <= x < 2^32 and 0 <= y < 2^32.
      For positive integers n and m, let n mod m be the remainder upon
      dividing n by m.  Compute

         z  =  (x + y) mod 2^32.

      Then 0 <= z < 2^32.  Convert z to a word,  Z, and define Z = X +
      Y.

   c. The circular left shift operation S^n(X), where X is a word and n
      is an integer with 0 <= n < 32, is defined by

         S^n(X)  =  (X << n) OR (X >> 32-n).

      In the above, X << n is obtained as follows: discard the left-most
      n bits of X and then pad the result with n zeroes on the right
      (the result will still be 32 bits).  X >> n is obtained by
      discarding the right-most n bits of X and then padding the result
      with n zeroes on the left.  Thus S^n(X) is equivalent to a
      circular shift of X by n positions to the left.

4. Message Padding

   SHA-1 is used to compute a message digest for a message or data file
   that is provided as input.  The message or data file should be
   considered to be a bit string.  The length of the message is the
   number of bits in the message (the empty message has length 0).  If
   the number of bits in a message is a multiple of 8, for compactness
   we can represent the message in hex.  The purpose of message padding
   is to make the total length of a padded message a multiple of 512.
   SHA-1 sequentially processes blocks of 512 bits when computing the
   message digest.  The following specifies how this padding shall be
   performed.  As a summary, a "1" followed by m "0"s followed by a 64-
   bit integer are appended to the end of the message to produce a
   padded message of length 512 * n.  The 64-bit integer is the length
   of the original message.  The padded message is then processed by the
   SHA-1 as n 512-bit blocks.

RFC 3174           US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1)      September 2001


   Suppose a message has length l < 2^64.  Before it is input to the
   SHA-1, the message is padded on the right as follows:

   a. "1" is appended.  Example: if the original message is "01010000",
      this is padded to "010100001".

   b. "0"s are appended.  The number of "0"s will depend on the original
      length of the message.  The last 64 bits of the last 512-bit block
      are reserved

      for the length l of the original message.

      Example:  Suppose the original message is the bit string

         01100001 01100010 01100011 01100100 01100101.

      After step (a) this gives

         01100001 01100010 01100011 01100100 01100101 1.

      Since l = 40, the number of bits in the above is 41 and 407 "0"s
      are appended, making the total now 448.  This gives (in hex)

         61626364 65800000 00000000 00000000
         00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
         00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
         00000000 00000000.

   c. Obtain the 2-word representation of l, the number of bits in the
      original message.  If l < 2^32 then the first word is all zeroes.
      Append these two words to the padded message.

      Example: Suppose the original message is as in (b).  Then l = 40
      (note that l is computed before any padding).  The two-word
      representation of 40 is hex 00000000 00000028.  Hence the final
      padded message is hex

         61626364 65800000 00000000 00000000
         00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
         00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
         00000000 00000000 00000000 00000028.

      The padded message will contain 16 * n words for some n > 0.
      The padded message is regarded as a sequence of n blocks M(1) ,
      M(2), first characters (or bits) of the message.

5. Functions and Constants Used

   A sequence of logical functions f(0), f(1),..., f(79) is used in
   SHA-1.  Each f(t), 0 <= t <= 79, operates on three 32-bit words B, C,
   D and produces a 32-bit word as output.  f(t;B,C,D) is defined as
   follows: for words B, C, D,

      f(t;B,C,D) = (B AND C) OR ((NOT B) AND D)         ( 0 <= t <= 19)

      f(t;B,C,D) = B XOR C XOR D                        (20 <= t <= 39)

      f(t;B,C,D) = (B AND C) OR (B AND D) OR (C AND D)  (40 <= t <= 59)

      f(t;B,C,D) = B XOR C XOR D                        (60 <= t <= 79).

   A sequence of constant words K(0), K(1), ... , K(79) is used in the
   SHA-1.  In hex these are given by

      K(t) = 5A827999         ( 0 <= t <= 19)

      K(t) = 6ED9EBA1         (20 <= t <= 39)

      K(t) = 8F1BBCDC         (40 <= t <= 59)

      K(t) = CA62C1D6         (60 <= t <= 79).

6. Computing the Message Digest

   The methods given in 6.1 and 6.2 below yield the same message digest.
   Although using method 2 saves sixty-four 32-bit words of storage, it
   is likely to lengthen execution time due to the increased complexity
   of the address computations for the { W[t] } in step (c).  There are
   other computation methods which give identical results.

6.1 Method 1

   The message digest is computed using the message padded as described
   in section 4.  The computation is described using two buffers, each
   consisting of five 32-bit words, and a sequence of eighty 32-bit
   words.  The words of the first 5-word buffer are labeled A,B,C,D,E.
   The words of the second 5-word buffer are labeled H0, H1, H2, H3, H4.
   The words of the 80-word sequence are labeled W(0), W(1),..., W(79).
   A single word buffer TEMP is also employed.

   To generate the message digest, the 16-word blocks M(1), M(2),...,
   M(n) defined in section 4 are processed in order.  The processing of
   each M(i) involves 80 steps.

RFC 3174           US Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA1)      September 2001


   Before processing any blocks, the H's are initialized as follows: in
   hex,

      H0 = 67452301

      H1 = EFCDAB89

      H2 = 98BADCFE

      H3 = 10325476

      H4 = C3D2E1F0.

   Now M(1), M(2), ... , M(n) are processed.  To process M(i), we
   proceed as follows:

      a. Divide M(i) into 16 words W(0), W(1), ... , W(15), where W(0)
         is the left-most word.

      b. For t = 16 to 79 let

         W(t) = S^1(W(t-3) XOR W(t-8) XOR W(t-14) XOR W(t-16)).

      c. Let A = H0, B = H1, C = H2, D = H3, E = H4.

      d. For t = 0 to 79 do

         TEMP = S^5(A) + f(t;B,C,D) + E + W(t) + K(t);

         E = D;  D = C;  C = S^30(B);  B = A; A = TEMP;

      e. Let H0 = H0 + A, H1 = H1 + B, H2 = H2 + C, H3 = H3 + D, H4 = H4
         + E.

   After processing M(n), the message digest is the 160-bit string
   represented by the 5 words

         H0 H1 H2 H3 H4.

6.2 Method 2

   The method above assumes that the sequence W(0), ... , W(79) is
   implemented as an array of eighty 32-bit words.  This is efficient
   from the standpoint of minimization of execution time, since the
   addresses of W(t-3), ...  ,W(t-16) in step (b) are easily computed.
   If space is at a premium, an alternative is to regard { W(t) } as a

   circular queue, which may be implemented using an array of sixteen
   32-bit words W[0], ... W[15].  In this case, in hex let

   MASK = 0000000F.  Then processing of M(i) is as follows:

      a. Divide M(i) into 16 words W[0], ... , W[15], where W[0] is the
         left-most word.

      b. Let A = H0, B = H1, C = H2, D = H3, E = H4.

      c. For t = 0 to 79 do

         s = t AND MASK;

         if (t >= 16) W[s] = S^1(W[(s + 13) AND MASK] XOR W[(s + 8) AND
         MASK] XOR W[(s + 2) AND MASK] XOR W[s]);

         TEMP = S^5(A) + f(t;B,C,D) + E + W[s] + K(t);

         E = D; D = C; C = S^30(B); B = A; A = TEMP;

      d. Let H0 = H0 + A, H1 = H1 + B, H2 = H2 + C, H3 = H3 + D, H4 = H4
         + E.
