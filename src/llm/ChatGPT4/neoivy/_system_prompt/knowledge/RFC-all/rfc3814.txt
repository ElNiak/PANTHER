1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for specifying Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) to Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry (NHLFE)
   mappings and corresponding actions for Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS).

   At the ingress of an MPLS network, packets entering the MPLS domain
   are assigned to an FEC.  Those packets belonging to an FEC are
   associated with an NHLFE (i.e., MPLS label) via the FEC-to-NHLFE
   (FTN) mapping [RFC3031].  This relationship defines how ingress LSRs
   will impose MPLS labels onto incoming packets.  It also defines how
   egress LSRs will decapsulate the MPLS shim header from MPLS packets.

   Conceptually, some of the FTN table functionality could be
   implemented using the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) to map all
   packets destined for a prefix to an LSP.  However, this mapping is
   coarse in nature.

   Similar functionality is already being used in other contexts such as
   security filters, access filters, and RSVP flow identification.  All
   of these require various combinations of matching based on IP header
   and upper-layer header information to identify packets for a
   particular treatment.  When packets match a particular rule, a
   corresponding action is executed on those packets.  For example, two
   popular actions to take when a successful match is identified are
   allowing the packet to be forwarded or to discard it.  However, other

   actions are possible, such as modifying the TOS byte, or redirecting
   a packet to a particular outgoing interface.  In the context of MPLS,
   the possible actions performed by an NHLFE are to redirect packets to
   either an MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) or an MPLS Traffic
   Engineered (TE) Tunnel.

   This document attempts to consolidate the various matching
   requirements and associated action options needed for MPLS into a
   single specification.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

5.  Outline

   This MIB module resides on any LSR which does the FEC-to-NHLFE
   mapping in order to map traffic into the MPLS domain.  This MIB
   module consists of three tables:

   -  mplsFTNTable defines the rule base against which incoming packets
      are matched and defines the actions to be taken on matching
      packets;

   -  mplsFTNMapTable defines the application of these rules to specific
      interfaces;

   -  mplsFTNPerfTable provides performance counters for every entry in
      mplsFTNTable that is active on one or more interfaces, on a per-
      interface basis.

5.1.  mplsFTNTable

   This table allows FEC to NHLFE mappings to be specified.  Each entry
   in this table (also referred to as an "FTN entry" in this document)
   defines a rule to be applied to incoming packets (on interfaces that
   the entry is activated on using mplsFTNMapTable as explained in
   Section 5.2) and an action to be taken on matching packets.
   mplsFTNTable allows 6-tuple matching rules based on one or more of
   source address range, destination address range, source port range,
   destination port range, IPv4 Protocol field [RFC791] or IPv6 next-
   header field [RFC2460], and the DiffServ Code Point (DSCP, [RFC2474])
   to be specified.  Packet redirection is based on an action pointer
   which points either at an mplsXCEntry in MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813]
   when the NHLFE is a non-TE LSP, or at an mplsTunnelEntry in MPLS-TE-
   STD-MIB [RFC3812] when the NHLFE is the origin of a TE tunnel.

5.1.1.  Advantages of Address Ranges Over CIDR Prefixes

   One possible way of specifying a set of addresses as part of an FTN
   rule is to use CIDR prefixes [RFC1519].  We have instead chosen to
   allow FTN rules to be expressed in terms of address ranges in
   mplsFTNTable because they have the following advantages.

   -  The number of CIDR prefixes needed to represent some address
      ranges is very large.  For example, we need the following 6 CIDR
      prefixes to represent the range of addresses [192.0.2.0-
      192.0.2.62]:  192.0.2.0/27, 192.0.2.32/28, 192.0.2.48/29,
      192.0.2.56/30, 192.0.2.60/31, and 192.0.2.62/32.  A rule such as
      "redirect all packets with a source address in the range
      [192.0.2.0-192.0.2.62] and destination address in the range
      [192.0.2.128-192.0.2.190] to tunnel #2" would require the creation



Nadeau, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 3814                      MPLS FTN MIB                     June 2004


      of 36 conceptual rows in mplsFTNTable if the rules were expressed
      as CIDR prefixes, but only a single conceptual row would be
      required if we used address ranges instead.

   -  Every CIDR prefix can be expressed as a single equivalent address
      range.

   -  A particular implementation is free to translate the address
      ranges specified in mplsFTNTable internally to equivalent CIDR
      prefixes, if it so chooses.  However, given that powerful range
      matching algorithms are available, many implementations may prefer
      to implement these directly.

5.2.  mplsFTNMapTable

   This table provides the capability to activate or map FTN entries
   defined in mplsFTNTable to specific interfaces in the system.
   Packets received on an interface are compared against FTN entries in
   the order in which entries are applied to the interface.

5.2.1.  Indexing Requirements

   The indexing structure of mplsFTNMapTable was designed to satisfy the
   following requirements.

   -  We must be able to insert a new entry into an existing list of
      entries on an interface with a single SET operation.  Thus, we
      must be able to support an insertion operation that does not
      require manual reindexing of existing entries.

   -  A management application must be able to traverse entries that
      have been applied to a particular interface in the order of
      application.  The number of (non-bulk) retrieval operations to
      obtain this information as dictated by the particular indexing
      scheme that we choose for mplsFTNMapTable must be no more than
      that dictated by any other indexing scheme.  For example, the
      indexing scheme must not force the Network Management Application
      to retrieve all the entries in the table and sift through them
      offline to obtain this information.

5.2.2.  How the Current Indexing Works

   The natural data-structure for implementing constant time insertions
   between two existing entries and for supporting in-order traversals
   is a linked-list.

   The chosen indexing structure of mplsFTNMapTable makes the entries in
   the table behave like items in a linked-list.  Each conceptual row



Nadeau, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 3814                      MPLS FTN MIB                     June 2004


   has an object, mplsFTNMapPrevIndex, which is a pointer to the
   previous entry that is applied to a particular interface.  This
   object is self-adjusting, i.e., its value is automatically adjusted
   by the agent, if necessary, after an insertion or deletion operation.

   This indexing scheme provides a mechanism to 'insert' an FTN entry
   between two existing entries already applied on an interface.  This
   is done by specifying the entry after which a new entry should be
   inserted in mplsFTNMapPrevIndex.

   Using this linked-list structure, one can retrieve FTN entries in the
   order of application on a per-interface basis as follows:

   -  To determine the first FTN entry on an interface with index
      ifIndex, perform a GETNEXT retrieval operation on
      mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.0.0; the returned object, if one
      exists, is (say) mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.0.n
      (mplsFTNMapRowStatus is the first accessible columnar object in
      the conceptual row).  Then, the index of the first FTN entry
      applied on this interface is n.

   -  To determine the FTN entry applied to an interface after the one
      indexed by n, perform a GETNEXT retrieval operation on
      mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.n.0.  If such an entry exists, the
      returned object would be of the form
      mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.n.m.  Then, the index of the next FTN
      entry applied on this interface is m.

   -  If the FTN entry indexed by n is the last entry applied to the
      interface with index ifIndex, then the object returned would
      either be:

      1. mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndexNext.0.k, where ifIndexNext is the
         index of the next interface in ifTable to which an FTN entry
         has been applied, in which case k is the index of the first FTN
         entry applied to the interface with index ifIndexNext;

      or:

      2. mplsFTNMapStorageType.firstIfIndex.0.p, if there are no more
         entries in mplsFTNMapTable, where firstIfIndex is the first
         entry in ifTable to which an FTN entry has been mapped.

   The above steps can be used to retrieve all the applied entries on a
   per-interface basis in application order.  Note that the number of
   retrieval operations is equal to the number of applied FTN entries
   (i.e., the minimum number of GETNEXT operations needed using any
   indexing scheme).



Nadeau, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 3814                      MPLS FTN MIB                     June 2004


   Also note that we could not have created this linked-list structure
   using a 'next' pointer object instead of the 'previous' pointer
   object that we chose because this would not allow us to determine the
   first FTN entry that has been mapped to a specific interface using a
   single SNMP (non-bulk) retrieval operation.

   The use of this indexing structure is further illustrated using an
   example in Section 7.

5.3.  mplsFTNPerfTable

   If an FTN entry has been applied to one or more interfaces, this
   table provides high-capacity performance counters to monitor each
   such FTN entry on a per-interface basis.

6.  Avoiding Retrieval-Modification Interactions

   The problem of an ongoing traversal or retrieval operation on an SNMP
   table being affected by a concurrent modification operation on that
   table is not unique to this MIB module.  However, it is useful to
   note that a cautious application can keep track of the state of the
   modifiable tables in this MIB module using the objects
   mplsFTNTableLastChanged and mplsFTNMapTableLastChanged.

   For instance, before performing a traversal of mplsFTNMapTable, the
   application should retrieve the value of mplsFTNMapTableLastChanged.
   Each subsequent GETNEXT operation on the table should include this
   object as well.  For example, GETNEXT(mplsFTNMapTableLastChanged.0,
   mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.n.0) can be used to:

   -  Determine the FTN entry after the one indexed by n (in linked-list
      order) mapped to the interface with index ifIndex, as explained in
      Section 5.2.2;

   - Verify that the value of mplsFTNMapTable has not been modified
      during the retrieval process by comparing the value of
      mplsFTNMapTableLastChanged retrieved by this operation with the
      value retrieved before the traversal was begun.

   Using this technique, an application can ensure the validity of the
   retrieved information with minimal overhead.  This is particularly
   important while retrieving information from frequently modified
   tables.

7.  Example Illustrating MIB Module Components

   In this section, we use an example to illustrate how the objects
   defined in MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB work together to perform FEC to NHLFE
   mapping.

   Note that for the various table entries involved in this example, we
   only show the objects that help illustrate each case.

7.1.  Sample FTN Rules

   Suppose that we wish to activate the following two FTN rules.

      Rule #1: On interface ifIndex = 1, redirect packets with source
      IPv4 address matching 192.0.2.63 to an LSP with outgoing
      ifIndex = 50 and outgoing label = 150 where the specified LSP is
      represented by the following entries in mplsXCTable and
      mplsOutSegmentTable.

      In mplsXCTable:

      {
         mplsXCIndex = 0x02,
         mplsXCInSegmentIndex = 0x00,
         mplsXCOutSegmentIndex = 0x03,
         mplsXCLabelStackIndex = 0
      }

      The value 0x00 for mplsXCInSegmentIndex represents an originating
      LSP [RFC3813].

      In mplsOutSegmentTable:

      {
         mplsOutSegmentIndex = 0x03,
         mplsOutSegmentIfIndex = 50,
         mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel = true,
         mplsOutSegmentTopLabel = 150
      }

      Rule #2: On interface ifIndex = 1, redirect packets with
      destination IPv4 addresses in the range [192.0.2.32, 192.0.2.96]
      to tunnel #4, where the specified tunnel is represented by the
      following entry in mplsTunnelTable:







Nadeau, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 3814                      MPLS FTN MIB                     June 2004


      {
         mplsTunnelIndex = 4,
         -- primary tunnel
         mplsTunnelInstance = 0,
         mplsTunnelIngressLSRID = 192.0.2.1,
         mplsTunnelEgressLSRID = 192.0.2.2
      }

7.2.  Creating FTN Entries and Applying them to Interfaces

   The action "redirect packets with source IPv4 address matching
   192.0.2.63 to an LSP with outgoing ifIndex = 50 and outgoing label =
   150" in Rule #1 can be implemented by the following entry in
   mplsFTNTable:

      {
         mplsFTNIndex = 1,
         mplsFTNDescr = "Rule #1",
         -- source address only
         mplsFTNMask = 0x80,
         mplsFTNAddrType = ipv4,
         mplsFTNSourceAddrMin = 192.0.2.63,
         mplsFTNSourceAddrMax = 192.0.2.63,
         mplsFTNActionType = redirectLsp(1),
         mplsFTNActionPointer = mplsXCLspId.1.2.1.0.1.3
      }

   This indicates to which LSP the LSR should redirect packets by
   setting mplsFTNActionPointer to the first accessible columnar object
   instance in mplsXCEntry that corresponds of the LSP to use, in this
   case mplsXCLspId.1.2.1.0.1.3.

   This action is then activated on "interface ifIndex = 1" by the
   following entry in mplsFTNMapTable to complete the implementation of
   Rule #1:

      {
         -- apply rule to interface ifIndex = 1
         mplsFTNMapIndex = 1,
         -- first FTN entry on this interface
         mplsFTNPrevIndex = 0,
         -- index of current entry in mplsFTNTable, i.e., Rule #1
         mplsFTNMapCurrIndex = 1
      }

   The action "redirect packets with destination IPv4 addresses in the
   range [192.0.2.32, 192.0.2.96] to tunnel #4" in Rule #2 can be
   implemented by the following entry in mplsFTNTable:

         mplsFTNIndex = 2,
         mplsFTNDescr = "Rule #2",

         mplsFTNAddrType = ipv4,
         mplsFTNDestAddrMin = 192.0.2.32,
         mplsFTNDestAddrMax = 192.0.2.96,
         mplsFTNActionType = redirectTunnel(2),
         mplsFTNActionPointer = mplsTunnelName.4.0.3221225985.3221225986
      }

   where 3221225985 and 3221225986 are representations of the addresses
   192.0.2.1 and 192.0.2.2, respectively, as Unsigned32 (the underlying
   data type) entities.

   This rule needs to be activated on "interface ifIndex = 1" after Rule
   #1 which was previously activated on this interface.  This is done by
   the following entry in mplsFTNMapTable to complete the implementation
   of Rule #2:

      {
         -- apply rule to interface ifIndex = 1
         mplsFTNMapIndex = 1,
         -- insert after Rule #1 (mplsFTNIndex = 1)
         mplsFTNPrevIndex = 1,
         -- index of current entry in mplsFTNTable, i.e., Rule #2
         mplsFTNMapCurrIndex = 2
      }

7.3.  Mapping an FTN Entry to Multiple Interfaces

   Suppose we now wish to activate the following rule:

      Rule #2b: On interface ifIndex = 2, redirect packets with
      destination IPv4 addresses in the range [192.0.2.32, 192.0.2.96]
      to tunnel #4.

   Notice that the FEC and corresponding action associated with this
   rule (i.e., "redirect packets with destination IPv4 addresses in the
   range [192.0.2.32, 192.0.2.96] to tunnel #4") are the same as that
   associated with Rule #2.  Hence, we can reuse the existing entry with
   mplsFTNIndex = 2 from mplsFTNTable.

   However, we have to create the following new entry in mplsFTNMapTable
   to activate this FTN entry as the first one on the interface with
   ifIndex = 2.

RFC 3814                      MPLS FTN MIB                     June 2004


   {
      -- apply rule to interface ifIndex = 2
      mplsFTNMapIndex = 2,
      -- first FTN entry on this interface
      mplsFTNPrevIndex = 0,
      -- index of current entry in mplsFTNTable
      mplsFTNMapCurrIndex = 2
   }

7.4.  Inserting an Entry Into Existing List

   At a later point, suppose that we wish to introduce the following
   Rule between Rules #1 and #2.

      Rule #3: On interface ifIndex = 1, redirect all packets with
      destination IPv4 address matching the prefix 192.0.2.32/28 to
      tunnel #3, where the tunnel we wish to redirect traffic to is
      represented by the following entry in mplsTunnelTable:

      {
         mplsTunnelIndex = 3,
         -- primary tunnel
         mplsTunnelInstance = 0,
         mplsTunnelIngressLSRID = 192.0.2.3,
         mplsTunnelEgressLSRID = 192.0.2.4
      }

   Note that the ordering of the rules on a particular interface is
   critical since the range of addresses specified in Rule #3 is a
   subset of the ones specified in Rule #2.

   Without the linked-list style insertion feature supported by
   mplsFTNMapTable, we would possibly have had to reindex existing
   entries (or plan for such changes by leaving sufficient gaps between
   indexes, something that only postpones the problem).  With the
   existing tables, we solve this problem by creating the following
   entries.

   We implement the phrase "redirect all packets with destination IPv4
   address matching the prefix 1.4.0.0/16 to tunnel #3" in Rule #3 by
   creating the following entry in mplsFTNTable:










Nadeau, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 11]

RFC 3814                      MPLS FTN MIB                     June 2004


      {
         mplsFTNIndex = 3,
         mplsFTNDescr = "Rule #3",
         -- destination address only
         mplsFTNMask = 0x40,
         mplsFTNAddrType = ipv4,
         -- address range equivalent to CIDR prefix 192.0.2.32/28
         mplsFTNDestAddrMin = 192.0.2.32,
         mplsFTNDestAddrMax = 192.0.2.47,
         mplsFTNActionType = redirectTunnel,
         mplsFTNActionPointer = mplsTunnelName.3.0.3221225987.3221225988
      }

   where 3221225987 and 3221225988 are representations of the addresses
   192.0.2.3 and 192.0.2.4, respectively, as Unsigned32 (the underlying
   data type) entities.

   We next insert this rule in mplsFTNMapTable just after Rule #1 as
   follows:

      {
         -- apply rule to interface ifIndex = 1
         mplsFTNMapIndex = 1,
         -- insert after Rule #1 (mplsFTNIndex = 1)
         mplsFTNPrevIndex = 1,
         -- index of current entry in mplsFTNTable i.e., Rule #3
         mplsFTNMapCurrIndex = 3
      }

   After the insertion of Rule #3 in mplsFTNMapTable, the 'previous'
   pointer object mplsFTNMapPrevIndex of the next entry (corresponding
   to Rule #2) adjusts automatically to point to this entry.

   Note that, of the existing entries in the table, the only one that is
   impacted by an insertion operation is the entry on that particular
   interface immediately after the newly inserted one, if one exists.
   None of the other entries in mplsFTNMapTable are impacted.  For
   instance, in this particular example, when the entry for Rule #3 was
   inserted between those for Rules #1 and #2, the entries for Rules #1
   and #2b were not impacted.

7.5.  Pictorial Tabular Relationship

   At this point, the relationship between different table entries can
   be represented pictorially as follows.  For each conceptual row
   instance, we show the table that it belongs to, along with its
   indices in parentheses.  (Note that various conceptual rows are
   depicted in a way that is convenient for showing the
   interrelationships and are not necessarily in lexicographical order.)

7.6.  Deleting an Entry

   Let us next look at how we can remove the recently applied Rule #3
   and how the existing conceptual rows behave in this situation.

   The conceptual row corresponding to the application of Rule #3 to
   interface ifIndex = 1 has the following index values: mplsFTNMapIndex
   = 1, mplsFTNMapPrevIndex = 1, and mplsFTNMapCurrIndex = 3.  To delete
   this conceptual row, the Network Management Application performs a
   SET operation setting the object instance mplsFTNMapRowStatus.1.1.3
   to the value destroy(6).  The agent then destroys this conceptual
   row.  It also automatically adjusts the object instance of
   mplsFTNMapPrevIndex corresponding to Rule #2 from the value 3 (i.e.,
   pointing to the recently destroyed Rule #3) to the value 1 (i.e., to
   Rule #1).

   At this point, the rules applied to interface ifIndex = 1 are Rule #1
   and Rule #2, in that order.  The relationship between different table
   entries can be represented pictorially as follows.

   Note that the FTN entry for Rule #3 still exists in mplsFTNTable at
   this point but is not referenced by any conceptual row in
   mplsFTNMapTable or mplsFTNPerfTable.

   Also note that the deletion of an entry from mplsFTNMapTable only
   impacts the entry on that particular interface immediately after the
   deleted entry, if one exists.  None of the other conceptual rows in
   mplsFTNMapTable are impacted.  For instance, in this particular
   example, when the entry for Rule #3 was deleted, the entries for
   Rules #1 and #2b were not impacted.

8.  The Use of RowPointer

   RowPointer is a textual convention used to identify a conceptual row
   in a conceptual table in a MIB by pointing to the first accessible
   object.  In this MIB module, in mplsFTNTable, the RowPointer object
   mplsFTNActionPointer indicates the LSP or TE Tunnel to redirect
   packets matching an FTN entry to.  This object MUST point to the
   first instance of the first accessible columnar object in the
   appropriate conceptual row in order to allow the manager to find the
   appropriate corresponding entry in either MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB [RFC3813]
   or MPLS-TE-STD-MIB [RFC3812].  If this object returns zeroDotZerok,
   it implies that there is no currently defined action that is
   associated with that particular FTN entry.

           to obtain the current value of this object.

           If the command responder (agent) does not wish to allow
           creation of more entries in mplsFTNTable, possibly
           because of resource exhaustion, this object MUST return
           a value of 0.

           still unused since two Network Management Applications
           may attempt to create a row simultaneously and use the

           If it is currently unused and the SET succeeds, the
           agent MUST change the value of this object to a
           currently unused non-zero value (according to an
           implementation specific algorithm) or zero (if no
           further row creation will be permitted).

           If the value is in use, however, the SET fails and the

          "This table contains objects which provide the
           capability to apply or map FTN rules as defined by
           entries in mplsFTNTable to specific interfaces in the
           system.  FTN rules are compared with incoming packets
           in the order in which they are applied on an interface.

           The indexing structure of mplsFTNMapTable is as
           follows.

           - mplsFTNMapIndex indicates the interface to which the
             rule is being applied.  A value of 0 represents the
             application of the rule to all interfaces.

           - mplsFTNMapPrevIndex specifies the rule on the
             interface prior to the one being applied.  A value of
             0 specifies that the rule is being inserted at the
             head of the list of rules currently applied to the
             interface.

           - mplsFTNMapCurrIndex is the index in mplsFTNTable
             corresponding to the rule being applied.

           This indexing structure makes the entries in the table
           behave like items in a linked-list.  The object
           mplsFTNMapPrevIndex in each conceptual row is a pointer
           to the previous entry that is applied to a particular
           interface.  This allows a new entry to be 'inserted' at
           an arbitrary position in a list of entries currently
           applied to an interface.  This object is self-
           adjusting, i.e., its value is automatically adjusted by
           the agent, if necessary, after an insertion or deletion
           operation.

           Using this linked-list structure, one can retrieve FTN
           entries in the order of application on a per-interface
           basis as follows:

           - To determine the first FTN entry on an interface
             with index ifIndex perform a GETNEXT retrieval
             operation on mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.0.0; the
             returned object, if one exists, is (say)
             mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.0.n (mplsFTNMapRowStatus
             is the first accessible columnar object in the
             conceptual row). Then the index of the first FTN
             entry applied on this interface is n.

           - To determine the FTN entry applied to an interface
             after the one indexed by n perform a GETNEXT
             retrieval operation on
             mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.n.0.  If such an entry
             exists the returned object would be of the form
             mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndex.n.m.  Then the index of
             the next FTN entry applied on this interface is m.

           - If the FTN entry indexed by n is the last entry
             applied to the interface with index ifIndex then the
             object returned would either be:

             1.mplsFTNMapRowStatus.ifIndexNext.0.k, where
               ifIndexNext is the index of the next interface in

               ifTable to which an FTN entry has been applied, in
               which case k is the index of the first FTN entry
               applied to the interface with index ifIndexNext;

             or:

             2.mplsFTNMapStorageType.firstIfIndex.0.p, if there
               are no more entries in mplsFTNMapTable, where
               firstIfIndex is the first entry in ifTable to
               which an FTN entry has been mapped.

           Use the above steps to retrieve all the applied FTN
           entries on a per-interface basis in application order.
           Note that the number of retrieval operations is the
           same as the number of applied FTN entries (i.e., the
           minimum number of GETNEXT operations needed using any
           indexing scheme).

           Agents MUST NOT allow the same FTN entry as specified
           by mplsFTNMapCurrIndex to be applied multiple times to
           the same interface.

           Agents MUST NOT allow the creation of rows in this
           table until the corresponding rows are created in the
           mplsFTNTable.

           If a row in mplsFTNTable is destroyed, the agent MUST
           destroy the corresponding entries (i.e., ones with a
           matching value of mplsFTNCurrIndex) in this table as
           well."

10.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module can be used to configure LSRs to redirect non-MPLS
   traffic into an MPLS cloud.  As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented in this MIB module may result in traffic being
   redirected to unintended destinations, potentially resulting in
   denial of service to end-users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   -  mplsFTNTable and mplsFTNMapTable can be used to create packet
      matching rules for classifying IPv4 or IPv6 traffic and
      redirecting matched packets into the MPLS cloud.  Modifying
      objects in these tables can result in the misdirection of traffic
      and potential denial of service to end-users.  It may also result
      in traffic which was intended to be redirected into the MPLS cloud
      being routed through the IP network instead, potentially resulting
      in degradation of service quality or outright denial of service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   -  mplsFTNPerfTable provides counters for monitoring the performance
      of packet classification rules defined in mplsFTNTable and
      mplsFTNMapTable.  Unauthorized read access to objects in these
      tables may be used to gain traffic flow information.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).



Nadeau, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 38]

RFC 3814                      MPLS FTN MIB                     June 2004


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED that SNMPv3 be deployed and
   cryptographic security be enabled.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects to only those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

11.  IANA Considerations

   As described in [MPLSMGMT] and as requested in [RFC3811], MPLS
   related standards-track MIB modules should be rooted under the
   mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made by a standards
   action as specified in [RFC2434].

11.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB

   The IANA has assigned mplsStdMIB 8 to the MPLS-FTN-STD-MIB module
   specified in this document.
