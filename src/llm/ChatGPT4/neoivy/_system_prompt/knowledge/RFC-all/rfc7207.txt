1.  Introduction

   The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is composed of the
   European Central Bank (ECB) [ECB] and the national central banks
   (NCBs) of all 27 EU Member States (Article 107.01 of the Treaty) --
   whether they have adopted the Euro currency or not.  One central bank
   belonging to the ESCB is Deutsche Bundesbank [DBBK], which, for the
   purpose of this document, is acting on behalf of the ESCB.  The term
   Eurosystem is used to refer to the entity composed of the ECB and the
   NCBs of those member states that have adopted the Euro currency.  For
   further information on the tasks of the ESCB and the Eurosystem,
   please refer to the ECB web site ([ECB], [ESCB], [Eurosystem]).

   The ESCB provides the TARGET2 (Trans-European Automated Realtime
   Gross Settlement Express Transfer) system for market infrastructure;
   it is an interbank payment system for the real-time processing of
   cross-border transfers throughout the European Union.  In addition,
   the ESCB is currently implementing TARGET2-Securities, a future
   securities settlement platform that offers a new, harmonized and
   centralized method of settling securities in central bank money.  The
   TARGET2-Securities project was initiated by the Eurosystem as
   platform owner in 2006.  TARGET2-Securities is currently under
   development.  Four central banks of the Eurosystem -- Deutsche
   Bundesbank, Banque de France, Banca d'Italia, and Banco de Espana
   (4CB) -- are entrusted with the development and the operation of the
   platform.  For details, see [T2S_ECB] and [T2S_DBBK].

   The future users of TARGET2-Securities will communicate and exchange
   information with the platform via messages (a set of structured
   information) following the ISO 20022 Standard [ISO20022-RA].

RFC 7207                Eurosystem URN Namespace              April 2014


   This document specifies and registers with IANA a URN Namespace for
   the Eurosystem, which will be populated initially by names for
   abstract and concrete entities used in TARGET2-Securities messaging,
   but may be used for similar purposes in the future.

2.  Namespace Considerations

   The goal of the requested namespace is to ensure the stability and
   uniqueness of the names of various items that are used within the
   messages exchanged between the Eurosystem and the users of
   TARGET2-Securities (or potentially, other future projects of the
   Eurosystem).

   It is essential that names of items (such as the XML schema
   describing the message itself) can be used to identify the resource
   even years after the message has been exchanged.  This context
   requires a new namespace owned by, and under the perpetual control
   of, the Eurosystem.

   The messaging context of the needed identifiers necessitates the
   usage of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) as specified in Internet
   STD 66 [RFC3986].

   The persistent identifiers needed are protocol-independent resource
   names -- the same resource may exist in multiple physical locations,
   and thus be accessible via multiple URLs, but there's the need for a
   single abstract identifier as a handle (name) for it.

   Thus, the logical choice for the placement of such a namespace is the
   use of Uniform Resource Names (URNs), as defined by [RFC1737] and
   [RFC2141] (and its work-in-progress successor), by specifying a new
   URN Namespace [RFC3406] for the Eurosystem.

3.  Community Considerations

   The Eurosystem messages carrying the resource names are exchanged in
   IP networks.  Although the mass production use of the assigned URNs
   will be contained in messages carried in cryptographic digital
   envelopes or Virtual Private Networks, the message-related resources
   being persistently named need to be referred to and resolved in the
   public Internet.  The transparency requirements (needed for
   establishing and maintaining public trust into the subject financial
   transaction systems), open software development processes, and
   software deployment require the origin and authority for the URNs to
   be easily identified, and the URNs to be resolved on the public
   Internet.  URI references to the Eurosystem resources will be used in
   connection with identifiers drawn from previously standardized Formal
   URN Namespaces allocated to other international treaty organizations,



Ortseifen & Dickfeld          Informational                     [Page 3]

RFC 7207                Eurosystem URN Namespace              April 2014


   and it is mandatory that the authority behind the new URNs be easily
   and clearly identified, and be at a perceived "equivalent" standards
   level, parallel to the existing ones.  Therefore, a mnemonic, Formal
   URN Namespace Identifier is needed for the intended purpose.

   Thus, this document specifies a "Formal URN Namespace" using the
   procedures laid down in RFC 3406 [RFC3406] (and incorporates some of
   the additional information under discussion for its work-in-progress
   successor into the registration template below).

   The requested URN Namespace Identifier (NID) is 'eurosystem'.

4.  Registration Template for the Eurosystem URN Namespace

   The registration template below makes references to Internet STD 66,
   RFC 3986 [RFC3986].

   Namespace ID:  eurosystem

   Scope / kind of named resources:
      Resources related to Eurosystem messaging.
      This namespace is reserved to the Eurosystem and its community.

   Registration Information:

      -  version number:  1

      -  date:  2014-02-18

   Declared registrant of the Namespace:

      -  Registering organization:

RFC 7207                Eurosystem URN Namespace              April 2014


   Declaration of syntactic structure of NSS part:

      The structure of the Namespace Specific String is a flat space of
      printable URI characters (<pchar>; see RFC 3986), with a
      preference for short letter-digit-period-hyphen-based strings.
      The NSS has no knowable structure outside of the context of the
      Eurosystem community internal resolver.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      None

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special consideration.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence of NSS part:

      No special consideration.

   Usage of query part:

      There is no support for query instructions or other components of
      the query part to be used in URI references to 'eurosystem' URNs.

   Usage of fragment part:

      The fragment part of URI references to 'eurosystem' URNs has no
      particular specified utility.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      Identifiers are opaquely assigned by Eurosystem URN Registration
      that guarantees uniqueness.  This is simply achieved by reliably
      keeping track of already assigned names and comparing all new
      proposed names to the ones already present in the database.  If
      the name already has been assigned, a new one has to be proposed.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      Assigned URNs will not be reused and will remain valid beyond the
      lifecycle of the referenced resources.  However, it should be
      noted that although the URNs remain valid, the status of the
      referenced resource may change.

RFC 7207                Eurosystem URN Namespace              April 2014


   Process of identifier assignment:

      Names are granted by Eurosystem URN Registration via proprietary
      registration procedures.

      Future changes to the assignment methods may allow others to
      assign sub-spaces of the flat namespace, but again, this knowledge
      is only valid internally and should never be inferred or relied
      upon externally.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      Eurosystem URNs are resolved via URN resolvers run under
      Eurosystem responsibility.

      Initially, resolution service will be provided via a web page
      listing the assigned names and the related metadata of the named
      resources.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.

5.  Example

   The following example is listed for pedagogical reasons only; it is
   not guaranteed to become actually assigned.

      urn:eurosystem:xsd:reda.012.001.01

6.  Security Considerations

   Since the URNs in this namespace are opaque, there are no additional
   security considerations other than those normally associated with the
   use and resolution of URIs and URNs in general (see the Security
   Considerations in Internet STD 66 [RFC3986], RFC 2141 [RFC2141], and
   BCP 66 [RFC3406]).

   It is noted, however, that attempting to resolve a Eurosystem URN
   through a resolver other than the one provided by the Eurosystem is
   error prone.  In any case, it is not considered authoritative.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of Formal URN Namespace 'eurosystem'

   IANA maintains the registry of URN Namespaces [IANA-URN] and has
   registered a new Formal URN Namespace with the NID 'eurosystem' as
   per BCP 66 [RFC3406], using the registration template given above in
   Section 4.
