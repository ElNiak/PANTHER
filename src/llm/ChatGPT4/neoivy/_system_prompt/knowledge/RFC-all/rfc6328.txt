1.  Introduction

   Some protocols being developed or extended by the IETF make use of
   the ISO/IEC (International Organization for Standardization /
   International Electrotechnical Commission) Network Layer Protocol
   Identifier (NLPID).

   The term "NLPID" is not actually used in [ISO9577], which refers to
   one-octet IPIs (Initial Protocol Identifiers) and SPIs (Subsequent
   Protocol Identifiers).  While these are two logically separate kinds
   of one-octet identifiers, most values are usable as both an IPI and
   an SPI.  In the remainder of this document, the term NLPID is used
   for such values.

   The registry of NLPID values is maintained by ISO/IEC by updating
   [ISO9577].  The procedure specified by ISO/IEC in that document is
   that an NLPID code point can be allocated without approval by
   ISO/IEC, as long as the code point is not in a range of values
   categorized for an organization other than the organization
   allocating the code point and as long as ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 is
   informed.

   This document provides NLPID IANA considerations.  That is, it
   specifies the level of IETF approval necessary for a code point to be
   allocated for IETF use, the procedures to be used and actions to be
   taken by IANA in connection with NLPIDs, and related guidelines.

   [RFC5226] is incorporated herein except to the extent that there are
   contrary provisions in this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  NLPIDs

   [ISO9577] defines one-octet network layer protocol identifiers that
   are commonly called NLPIDs, which is the term used in this document.

   NLPIDs are used in a number of protocols.  For example, in the
   mar$pro.type field of the multicast address resolution server
   protocol [RFC2022], the ar$pro.type field of the NBMA (Non-Broadcast
   Multi-Access) next hop resolution protocol [RFC2332] and in the IS-IS
   Protocols Supported TLV [RFC1195].  See Appendix B.

2.1.  Sub-Ranges of the NLPID

   Sub-ranges of the possible NLPID values are categorized by [ISO9577]
   for organizations as shown below, primarily for the ISO/IEC
   (International Organization for Standardization / International
   Electrotechnical Commission) and the ITU-T (International
   Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardization Sector):

      Code Point  Category
      ----------  --------
      0x00        ISO/IEC
      0x01-0x0F   ITU-T
      0x10-0x3F   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0x40-0x43   ISO/IEC
      0x44        ITU-T
      0x45-0x4F   ISO/IEC
      0x50-0x6F   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0x70-0x7F   Joint ITU-T and ISO/IEC
      0x80        ISO/IEC (see Section 2.2)
      0x81-0x8F   ISO/IEC
      0x90-0xAF   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0xB0-0xBF   ITU-T
      0xC0-0xCF   Potentially available for IANA (see Section 2.3)
      0xD0-0xEF   ITU-T Rec. X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208
      0xF0-0xFE   Joint ITU-T and ISO/IEC
      0xFF        Reserved for an Extension mechanism to be
                  jointly developed by ITU-T and ISO/IEC

RFC 6328             IANA Considerations for NLPIDs            July 2011


2.2.  Code Point 0x80

   NLPID 0x80 is known as the IEEE (Institute of Electrical &
   Electronics Engineers) SNAP (SubNetwork Access Protocol) code point.
   It is followed by five octets, using the IEEE SNAP SAP (Service
   Access Point) conventions, to specify the protocol.  Those
   conventions are described in Section 3 of [RFC5342].  In particular,
   it is valid for such a five-octet sequence to start with the IANA OUI
   (Organizationally Unique Identifier) followed by two further octets
   assigned by IANA as provided in [RFC5342].  The same IANA registry is
   used for such protocol identifiers whether they are planned to be
   introduced by the 0x80 NLPID or the IEEE SNAP SAP LSAPs (Link-Layer
   Service Access Points) (0xAAAA).  Values allocated by IANA may be
   used in either context as appropriate.

   Because of the limited number of NLPID code points available for IANA
   allocation, use of the IEEE SNAP NLPID is RECOMMENDED rather than
   allocation of a new one-octet NLPID code point.

2.3.  NLPIDs Available for IANA Allocation

   A limited number of code points are available that could be allocated
   by IANA under [ISO9577].  Because of this, it is desirable, where
   practical, to use code point 0x80, as discussed in Section 2.2 above,
   or to get code points allocated from the ranges categorized to other
   organizations.  For example, code point 0x8E was allocated for IPv6
   [RFC2460], although it is in a range of code points categorized for
   ISO/IEC.  One-byte code points are assigned to TRILL and IEEE 802.1aq
   as they are intended for use within the IS-IS Protocols Supported TLV
   [RFC1195].

   The table below, which includes two new code point allocations made
   by this document, shows those still available.

      Code Point  Status
      ----------  --------
      0xC0        TRILL [RFC6325]
      0xC1        IEEE 802.1aq [802.1aq]
      0xC2-0xCB   Available
      0xCC        IPv4 [RFC791]
      0xCD-0xCE   Available
      0xCF        PPP [RFC1661]

3.  IANA Considerations

   As long as code points are available, IANA will allocate additional
   values when required by applying the IETF Review policy as per
   [RFC5226].

   Whenever it allocates an NLPID, IANA will inform the IETF liaison to
   ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6 (Joint Technical Committee 1, Study Committee 6)
   [JTC1SC6], or if IANA is unable to determine that IETF liaison, the
   IAB.  The liaison (or the IAB) will then ensure that ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6
   is informed so that [ISO9577] can be updated since ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6
   is the body that maintains [ISO9577].  To simplify this process, it
   is desirable that the IAB maintain an IETF liaison to ISO/IEC JTC1
   SC6.

   This document allocates the code points 0xC0 and 0xC1 as shown in
   Section 2.3 and IANA shall request the liaison (or the IAB) to so
   inform ISO/IEC JTC1 SC6.

   IANA maintains a web page showing NLPIDs that have been allocated to
   a protocol being developed or extended by the IETF or are otherwise
   of interest.  The initial state of the web page is as shown in
   Appendix A.  IANA will update this web page for (1) NLPIDs allocated
   by IANA and (2) other allocations or de-allocations when IANA is
   requested to make such changes to this web page by the IETF liaison
   mentioned above.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with allocation of NLPIDs.  It is not
   directly concerned with security.

   Note: According to [RFC1707], NLPID 0x70 was assigned to IPv7.  That
   assignment appears to no longer be in effect as it is not listed in
   ISO/IEC 9577.  IPv7 was itself a temporary code point assignment made
   while a decision was being made between three candidates for the next
   generation of IP after IPv4.  Those candidates were assigned IPv6,
   IPv7, and IPv8.  IPv6 was selected.
