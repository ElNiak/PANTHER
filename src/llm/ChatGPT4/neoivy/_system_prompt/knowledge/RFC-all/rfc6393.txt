RFC 6393               Moving RFC 4693 to Historic        September 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document moves RFC 4693 [RFC4693] to Historic status.  It also
   obsoletes that document.

2.  Moving RFC 4693 to Historic Status

   RFC 4693 [RFC4693] established the IETF Operational Notes (IONs)
   series of documents on the experimental basis [RFC3933].  This series
   was intended to discuss the set of procedures that the IETF follows,
   but for which the RFC publication process is an inappropriate
   documentation vehicle.

   Per RFC 3933 [RFC3933], in March 2008, the IESG decided to terminate
   the IONs process experiment [IESG-IONS].  This document moves RFC
   4693 to Historic status, per [HISTORIC], to reflect experiment
   closure.  Please contact the IESG at <iesg@ietf.org> for further
   details, including motivation for the termination and further destiny
   of IONs.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is of administrative nature only; therefore, there are
   no security issues related to it.

4.  Acknowledgments

   Various discussions of, valuable comments on, and criticism of
   previous versions of this document were provided by (in alphabetical
   order) Harald Alvestrand, Brian Carpenter, Russ Housley, John
