THE ARC SYSTEM WILL BE UNAVAILABLE FOR USE DURING THANKSGIVING WEEK

The ARC PDP-10 system will be unavailable for ARC and NIC users
from Friday, November 17 (6:00 pm PST ) through Sunday, November
26. (10:00 pm PST).  This will give our hardware team a period of
nine days to work on equipment with a loss of only three SRI
working days to users (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.)

This is the Network Information Center's notice to its network
users of the schedule.

    In addition, a login message will be sent starting about 6
    November to all users showing schedule.

       It will read something like: "THE ARC/NIC PDP-10 SYSTEM
      WILL BE UNAVAILABLE FOR USE FROM FRIDAY NOV 17 (6:00 pm
      PST) THRU SUNDAY NOV 26 (10:00 pm PST) FOR MAJOR HARDWARE
      WORK AS OUTLINED IN (12542,)".

For those who are interested, the hardware facility work to be
done during this period will include:

   Removal of the Bryant disk, Bryant disk controller and
   Cybernex drum-disk interference.

   Moving the Tasker display system and DEC dispack (old and
   new) equipment to their new locations.

   Having Bryant people run a combination drum maintenance and
   training session to teach ARC people how to change heads and
   clean the drum.

   Redoing the power cabling to the drum.

   Putting the new signal cable in between drum and controller.

   Debugging the parity checker.
