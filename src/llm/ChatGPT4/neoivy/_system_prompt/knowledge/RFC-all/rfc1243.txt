2.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
      and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212
      defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
      consistent with the SMI.

      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an
      evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

      RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
      access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

3.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

3.1.  Format of Definitions

   Section 5 contains the specification of all object types contained in
   this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the conventions
   defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions specified in [9,10].

4.  Overview

   AppleTalk is a protocol suite which features an open peer-to-peer
   architecture that runs over a variety of transmission media.
   AppleTalk is defined in [10].  This protocol suite interoperates with
   the IP protocol suite through various encapsulation methods.  As
   large AppleTalk networks are built that coexist with large IP
   networks, a method to manage the AppleTalk networks with SNMP becomes
   necessary.  This MIB defines managed objects to be used for managing
   AppleTalk networks.

4.1.  Structure of MIB

   The objects are arranged into the following groups:

                      - LLAP
                      - AARP
                      - ATPort
                      - DDP
                      - RTMP
                      - KIP
                      - ZIP
                      - NBP
                      - ATEcho

   These groups are the basic unit of conformance. If the semantics of a
   group is applicable to an implementation, then it must implement all
   objects in that group.  For example, a managed agent must implement
   the KIP group if and only if it implements the KIP protocol.

   These groups are defined to provide a means of assigning object
   identifiers, and to provide a method for managed agents to know which
   objects they must implement.

4.2.  The LocalTalk Link Access Protocol Group

   The LocalTalk Link Access Protocol (LLAP) is a medium-speed data-link
   protocol designed for low cost and plug-and-play operation.  The LLAP
   group is designed to manage all interfaces on a managed device that
   use this protocol.

4.3.  The AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol Group

   The AppleTalk Address Resolution Protocol (AARP) is used to map
   between AppleTalk node addresses, used by the Datagram Delivery
   Protocol, and the addresses of the underlying data link layer.  The
   AARP table allows for management of the Address Mapping Table on the
   managed device.

4.4.  The AppleTalk Port Group

   An AppleTalk Port is a logical connection to a network over which
   AppleTalk packets can be transmitted.  This group allows the
   management of the configuration of these AppleTalk ports.

4.5.  The Datagram Delivery Protocol Group

   The Datagram Delivery Protocol (DDP) is the network-layer protocol
   that is responsible for the socket-to-socket delivery of datagrams
   over the AppleTalk Internet.  This group manages the DDP layer on the
   managed device.

4.6.  The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol Group

   The Routing Table Maintenance Protocol (RTMP) is used by AppleTalk
   routers to create and maintain the routing tables that dictate the
   process of forwarding datagrams on the AppleTalk internet.  The RTMP
   group manages the RTMP protocol as well as the routing tables
   generated by this protocol.

4.7.  The Kinetics Internet Protocol Group

   The Kinetics Internet Protocol (KIP) is a protocol for encapsulating
   and routing AppleTalk datagrams over an IP internet.  This name is
   historical.  The KIP group manages the KIP routing protocol as well
   as the routing tables generated by this protocol.

4.8.  The Zone Information Protocol Group

   The Zone Information Protocol (ZIP) is used to maintain a mapping
   between networks and zone names to facilitate the name lookup process
   performed by the Name Binding Protocol.  The ZIP group manages this
   protocol and the mapping it produces.

4.9.  The Name Binding Protocol Group

   The Name Binding Protocol (NBP) is a transport-level protocol that is
   used to convert human readable service names into the numeric
   AppleTalk network addresses needed for communicating across the

   AppleTalk network.  The NBP group manages this protocol and the NBP
   services that exist on the managed device.

4.10.  The AppleTalk Echo Protocol Group

   The AppleTalk Echo Protocol is a transport-level protocol used to
   test and verify the status of the AppleTalk internet.  The AtEcho
   group manages this protocol.

4.11.  Textual Conventions

   A new data type is introduced as a textual convention in this MIB
   document.  This textual convention enhances the readability of the
   specification and can ease comparison with other specifications if
   appropriate.  It should be noted that the introduction of this
   textual convention has no effect on either the syntax or the
   semantics of any managed objects.  The use of this is merely an
   artifact of the explanatory method used.  Objects defined in terms of
   this method are always encoded by means of the rules that define the
   primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the SMI or the SNMP are
   necessary to accommodate this textual convention which is adopted
   merely for the convenience of readers and writers in pursuit of the
   elusive goal of clear, concise, and unambiguous MIB documents.

   The new data type is:

                  DdpAddress ::=          -- 2 octets of net number,
                                          -- 1 octet of node number
                          OCTET STRING (SIZE (3))
