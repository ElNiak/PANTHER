1.  Introduction

   The Sieve Email Filtering Language [RFC5228] is a popular email
   filtering language used upon final mail delivery.  The popularity of
   Sieve resulted in a myriad of Sieve extensions that can interact with
   each other in wonderful and complex ways.  Currently, there is no
   easy way to find out all actions defined by Sieve extensions
   published in RFCs, which makes it quite difficult for Sieve extension
   writers and Sieve implementation developers to foresee interactions
   between Sieve actions.

   This document creates a registry for Sieve [RFC5228] actions in order
   to help developers and Sieve extension writers track interactions
   between different extensions.

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Sieve Actions Registration Template and Procedure

   IANA has created the "Sieve Actions" registry (see Section 2.9 of
   [RFC5228] for details on Sieve actions).  Registration of actions
   specified in both RFCs and vendor-specific documentation is allowed
   and encouraged.  The registration template contains the following:

   Name:  Name of the action
   Description:  Short description
   References:  One or more documents describing the action and any
      significant updates to its definition (this field is required for
      actions described in RFCs and is optional otherwise)
   Capabilities:  Name of one or more Sieve capabilities associated with
      the Sieve action being registered
   Action Interactions:  Interactions with other Sieve actions (as
      described in Section 2.10.1 of [RFC5228]), if any
   Cancels Implicit Keep?  Flag specifying whether the action cancels
      the implicit keep (see Section 2.10.2 of [RFC5228])
   Can Use With IMAP Events?  Whether or not this action can be used
      with IMAP events in Sieve [RFC6785]
   Comments:  Optional comment or comments

   The registration procedure is Expert Review [RFC8126].  The
   designated expert only checks that the name of the action being
   registered matches documentation, the description field is accurate,
   the correct documents are referenced, and the list of relevant
   documents is as complete as possible.  The designated expert can't
   reject a registration because of a personal dislike for the document
   defining an action and should always err on the side of approving the
   registration, even if documentation is not complete.

   The same registration procedure is used to add a new reference or to
   change the description field of an existing registration.

2.2.  Initial Sieve Action Registry

   The following registrations are used to initialize the "Sieve
   Actions" registry.  Note that when the relevant "Action Interactions"
   entry is marked "N/A", it means that there is no restriction on use
   of the corresponding action with any other action; however,
   implementors still need to read the one or more corresponding
   specifications to determine if there are any surprising behaviors.
   Also note that the "Comments" field of the IANA registration template
   is omitted from these registrations, as none of them currently have
   any comments.

3.  Security Considerations

   The sole purpose of this document is to create the "Sieve Actions"
   registry; therefore, it doesn't create new security considerations
   for Sieve implementations.

   The new registry should help Sieve extension writers and Sieve
   implementors track interactions between different Sieve actions;
   therefore, it might improve the quality of specifications and
   implementations, including security aspects.

   For security considerations related to particular actions, see the
   one or more RFCs referenced for the action in question in the "Sieve
   Actions" registry (Section 2.2).
