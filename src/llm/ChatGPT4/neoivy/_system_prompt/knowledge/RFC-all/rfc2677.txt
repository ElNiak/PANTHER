1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for the Next Hop
   Resolution Protocol (NHRP) as defined in RFC 2332 [17].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [21].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
        1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
        SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
        [12].

RFC 2677                        NHRP MIB                     August 1999


    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Structure of the MIB

   The NHRP MIB contains three groups: the General Group, the Client
   Group, and the Server Group.

3.1.  The NHRP General Group

   The General Group contains objects that apply to both clients and
   servers -- in particular the nhrpNextIndex scalar object,  the NHRP
   Cache Table and the NHRP Purge Request Table.

   The nhrpNextIndex scalar object is used to provide unique indices for
   the nhprClientIndex in the nhrpClientTable and the nhrpServerIndex in
   the nhrpServerTable.  If used consistently, this object may prevent
   conflicts when multiple managers attempt to create rows
   simultaneously in the same table.

RFC 2677                        NHRP MIB                     August 1999


3.1.1.  The NHRP Cache Table

   The NHRP Cache Table represents the internetwork layer address to
   NBMA address cache that is maintained by both NHRP clients and NHRP
   servers.

   The NHRP Cache Table contains an ifIndex as part of the Index Clause.
   This ifIndex represents the use of a generic ifIndex, such that the
   value of this ifIndex SHOULD reflect a specific NBMA subnetwork
   related interface as determined by an implementation.  For example,
   assuming that the NBMA subnetwork is ATM, then it is up to the
   implementors of this MIB to determine their own ATM interface
   layering (assuming compliance with the IF-MIB, RFC 2233 [18] and the
   ATM-MIB, RFC 2515 [19]).  In other words, assuming that the NBMA
   subnetwork is ATM, the ifIndex in the NHRP Cache Table would
   represent the ifIndex containing or consisting of the VC (or
   shortcut) denoted by this Table entry.

   The indexing scheme for the NHRP Cache Table is very similar to the
   MPC Ingress Cache Table and the MPS Ingress Cache Table in the

   Multiprotocol Over ATM (MPOA) MIB [23].  This MIB and the MPOA MIB
   were designed to be complementary and non-overlapping.  The MPOA MIB
   should also support this MIB.  The MPOA MIB was designed prior to
   this MIB, and was designed by the LANE/MPOA Working Group in the ATM
   FORUM.   The indexing scheme of the NHRP Cache Table (and the NHRP
   Server Cache Table) reflect the indexing scheme of the MPC Ingress
   Cache Table and the MPS Ingress Cache Table.  Although, other
   indexing schemes could have been used for the NHRP Cache Table, a
   consistent indexing scheme between these tables was thought to be
   more advantageous from an implementation standpoint.

3.1.2.  The NHRP Purge Request Table

   The NHRP Purge Request Table is a way to track Purge Request
   Information.

3.2.  The NHRP Client Group

   The Client Group contains objects that only apply to NHRP clients
   (NHCs).

3.2.1.  The NHRP Client Table

   The NHRP Client Table contains entries for NHRP Next Hop Clients
   (NHCs) associated with this agent.  Each row in the table represents
   a single NHC.  The RequestID used in Registration requests needs to
   be saved to non-volatile storage.  Depending upon the implementation,



Greene, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2677                        NHRP MIB                     August 1999


   this may or may not impact how the StorageType is used.  For a
   complete description of how the Registration RequestID is used, see
   Section 5.2.3 of [17].

3.2.2.  The NHRP Client Registration Table

   The NHRP Client Registration Table contains information on
   registration requests which need to be maintained by the Clients.
   Each entry in this table represents a single registration request.
   Note:  since the NHRP specification does not mandate a refresh
   algorithm, this table omits refresh information, however, this table
   does contain information for all the registration requests which need
   to be maintained by the NHRP Clients.

3.2.3.  The NHRP Client NHS Table

   The NHRP Client NHS Table contains the NBMA subnetwork addresses of
   servers configured for use by the client.  By default, the agent will
   add an entry to this table which corresponds to the client's default
   router.

3.2.4.  The NHRP Client Statistics Table

   The NHRP Client Statistics Table contains NHRP statistics maintained
   by a client.  These statistics include counters on requests and
   replies, as well as counters for errors which are encountered by the
   Clients.

3.3.  The NHRP Server Group

   The Server Group contains objects that only apply to NHRP servers
   (NHSes).

3.3.1.  The NHRP Server Table

   The NHRP Server Table contains entries for each server associated
   with this agent.

3.3.2.  The NHRP Server Cache Table

   The NHRP Server Cache Table contains additional objects that a server
   keeps for each entry in its cache. This table extends the NHRP Cache
   Table defined in the General Group.

3.3.3.  The NHRP Server NHC Table

   This table contains information about all the Clients known to the
   Servers.

3.3.4.  The NHRP Server Statistics Table

   The NHRP Server Statistics Table contains NHRP statistics maintained
   by a server.  These statistics include counters on requests and
   replies, as well as counters for errors which are encountered by the
   Servers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has been and continues
   to be responsible for maintaining the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS
   (http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/address-family-numbers)
   name space assignments.  The IANA has placed this list in a MIB
   module, such that it may be imported into other MIBs.  The motivation
   for doing this is to allow MIBs to not have to change when a new
   assignment is made to the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS.  This is very
   similar to the motivation behind the IANAifType-MIB.

   Any additions or changes to the list of ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS
   registered via IANA will be done as they have in the past and this
   document does not propose any changes to the ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS
   other than to place them into a MIB, which can be found via anonymous
   FTP at: ftp://ftp.isi.edu/mib/ianaaddressfamilynumbers.mib.

6.  Security

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The NHRP Protocol, RFC 2332 [17], Section 5.2.4.4 discusses security.
   There is an authentication option which should be utilized to
   authenticate the source and also provide data integrity to the NHRP
   payload.  This MIB does not contain any managed objects which
   configure or expose security information such as that needed for NHRP
   authentication or data integrity.

   The following items were deemed to jeopardize security and thus, were
   NOT added to this MIB. Items denoted as (configurable) are those
   which would need values.  Items denoted as (read-only) are those
   which would provide information. Although the NHRP Protocol [17],
   requires or has this information, exposing it in a MIB would
   jeopardize the entire NBMA domain where NHRP was being used.
   Therefore, these items have been omitted from the MIB.

     1. (configurable) enable/disable security
     2. (configurable) SPI (security parameter index).
        Depending upon the implementation,
        there may be multiple SPIs, and these would
        be configurable also.  For example, if the
        implementation switched to a different SPI
        after a given time.
     3. (configurable) algorithm.
        The HMAC-MD5-128 is the default hash algorithm.
     4. (configurable) lifetime value in seconds.
     5. (read-only) key.
     6. (read-only) list of users who have access
        to the above information.

7.  Intellectual Property

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary
   rights which may cover technology that may be required to practice
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive
   Director.
