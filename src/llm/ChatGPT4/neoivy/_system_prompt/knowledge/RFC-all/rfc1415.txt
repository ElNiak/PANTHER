Abstract

   This memo describes a dual protocol stack application layer gateway
   that performs protocol translation, in an interactive environment,
   between the FTP and FTAM file transfer protocols.

   Two key assumptions are made:  1) POSIX file naming conventions and
   hierarchical organization, rather than proprietary conventions are in
   use; and 2) X.500 Directory Services are available.

1. Introduction

   The TCP/IP and OSI protocol suites will coexist in the Internet
   community for several years to come.  As more and more OSI hosts are
   fielded on the Internet, the requirement for gateways between the two
   protocol suites becomes more pressing.

   This specification describes an application layer gateway providing
   interoperability between the TCP/IP File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and
   the OSI File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM) protocol.  The
   proposed application layer gateway is based on a bi-directional set
   of mappings between the FTP and FTAM protocols.  Since the protocols

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   have quite different command structures, the mappings between them
   are not one-to-one.  This paper assumes knowledge of the File
   Transfer Protocol (FTP) [RFC959] and the File Transfer, Access, and
   Management Protocol (FTAM) [ISO8571-1,2,3,4,5].

   Two important goals of the mappings are to:

      Provide FTP users with as much emulated FTP capability on an
      FTAM Responder as possible, and

      Provide FTAM users with as much emulated FTAM capability on an
      FTP Server as possible.

   Though it is anticipated that the application layer gateway will be
   implemented on full protocol suites of both TCP/IP and OSI, at least
   one implementation of such a gateway (included in the ISO Development
   Environment) can be configured to operate FTAM over either OSI or
   TCP/IP lower-layer services.

1.1. Relationship to Other Work

   Ideas presented in this specification are based on lessons learned in
   fielding the gateway on the MILNET, operational at NCTS Washington
   D.C. since 1989, and on the efforts of M. A. Wallace et al. of the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [NIST86].  In
   1986, NIST published a design document for an FTP-FTAM gateway.
   Since that time, at least one implementation (for a subset of the FTP
   and FTAM protocols) of the gateway has been developed [MITRE87] and
   is included with the ISODE.  This implementation is based on the NIST
   protocol translator gateway design [NIST86].

   This document's contribution to the advancement of the FTP-FTAM
   gateway concept is to:

      *  Enhance the user interaction capability provided by the ISODE
         implementation of the FTP-FTAM application layer gateway.

      *  Clarify and enhance the mappings (FTP to FTAM, FTAM to FTP)
         documented by NIST.

      *  Provide guidelines for fielding the FTP-FTAM application layer
         gateway on the Internet so that it is useful as an Internet
         resource.

      *  Produce a formal specification for the FTP-FTAM gateway suitable
         for implementors to use in building additional FTP-FTAM
         gateways.

      *  Provide a formal specification for organizations wishing to
         procure FTP-FTAM gateways.

1.2. Overview of Gateway Operation

   The gateway provides a virtual end-to-end application file transfer
   service.  As data is sent via FTP, the gateway immediately maps the
   requested function to FTAM and passes it to the FTAM host.  In a
   similar fashion, but using a different set of mappings, an FTAM
   request is sent to the gateway, immediately mapped to an FTP
   function, and passed along to the FTP host.

   In FTP, the two parties involved in a file transfer are the Client
   and Server.  The Client is responsible for initiating a connection to
   the Server.  Once the connection is established, all service requests
   originate from the Client.  The FTP-FTAM gateway does not support the
   FTP three node model.

   In FTAM, the two parties involved in a file transfer are the
   Initiator and Responder.  The Initiator is responsible for initiating
   a connection to the Responder.  Once the connection is established,
   either the Initiator or Responder may issue service requests to the
   other.

   The FTP-FTAM gateway provides two sets of services:

        1. FTP-Initiated Gateway Services

           Utilized when an FTP Client contacts the FTP-FTAM gateway to
           instigate a file transfer with an FTAM Responder.

        2. FTAM-Initiated Gateway Services

           Utilized when an FTAM Initiator contacts the FTP-FTAM
           gateway to instigate a file transfer with an FTP Server.

   The gateway services' names were selected to identify the roles that
   the FTP-FTAM gateway plays when performing file transfers.  For
   example, when a file transfer is instigated by an FTP Client, it
   contacts the FTP Server portion of the gateway, which maps protocol
   information to the FTAM Initiator portion of the gateway, which in
   turn contacts the remote FTAM Responder.  This example scenario uses
   the FTP-Initiated Gateway Services.

   Figure 1 illustrates the perspective of the application process in
   the FTP-Initiated service.  Figure 2 illustrates that of the FTAM-
   Initiated service.

2. Gateway Architecture

   The gateway architecture, termed a protocol translator [NIST86], is
   depicted in Figure 3.  It implements TCP/IP and OSI protocol stacks
   with an application level process providing the link between the two.
   The link between FTP and FTAM is defined by two sets of protocol
   mappings, one each for the FTP-Initiated and FTAM-Initiated service
   sets.

   A fundamental aspect of this gateway architecture is that data is
   mapped and transmitted immediately; i.e., no transferred file need
   ever reside on the gateway file system.  In the context of this
   document, the term "filesystem" refers to the file access and
   maintenance mechanisms provided by the operating system.  This lack
   of gateway filesystem interaction helps speed up the end-to-end data
   transfer.  Another speed-enhancing feature of this architecture is
   that both the FTP and FTAM network connections can operate



Mindel & Slaski                                                 [Page 7]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   simultaneously.  Additional advantages include:

        1. FTP and FTAM hosts require no modification to utilize gateway
           services.

        2. Users require no knowledge of the other protocol.

        3. Gateway access control is not impaired (since users cannot
           directly access the gateway filesystem).

        4. No additional filesystem space is required on the gateway.

        5. Interactive nature of protocols is preserved.

        6. Users become aware of fatal errors immediately.

   Disadvantages of this design include the initial coding effort
   required to develop the gateway and the subsequent re-coding efforts
   required to keep it current.

3. Network Naming and Addressing

   The network naming and addressing schemes used by FTP (Domain Names
   (DN), IP Addresses) and FTAM (Distinguished Names, Presentation
   Addresses) are quite different.  This issue is quite apparent when a
   user of one protocol needs to identify a destination host of the
   other protocol.

   In the TCP/IP naming and addressing scheme, the identity of the FTP
   Server is its DN and its IP address [RFC1101].  To initiate a
   connection to an FTP Server, the FTP Client looks up a DN in either
   the Domain Name System (DNS) or static host table and obtains an IP
   address.

   In the OSI naming and addressing scheme, the identity of the FTAM
   Responder service is its Distinguished Name in the OSI Directory
   (X.500 or static table) and its Presentation address.  The
   Distinguished Name is an authoritative description of the service.  A
   Presentation address consists of a Presentation selector, a session
   selector, a transport selector, and a network address.  To initiate a
   connection to an FTAM Responder, the FTAM Initiator contacts the OSI
   Directory, presents the Distinguished Name of the desired FTAM
   Responder and asks for the Presentation address attribute associated
   with that name.

   An alternative to the direct use of Distinguished Names is to use
   "User Friendly Naming", as defined in [Kille92].  Gateway support for
   "User Friendly Naming" is recommended, but not required.

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


4. Use of the Gateway Services

4.1. FTP-Initiated Gateway Service

   The FTP Client uses the FTP-Initiated gateway service to utilize the
   resources of an FTAM Responder.

   To initiate a file transfer from an FTP Client, the Client connects
   to the FTP-Initiated gateway service via TCP/IP.  The gateway then
   establishes a connection, via OSI, to the FTAM Responder.  At this
   point, the user can initiate file transfer operations.

   The FTP Client is responsible for providing the gateway with an
   authoritative Distinguished Name, or a User Friendly Name, of the
   desired OSI filestore.  It is the responsibility of the gateway to
   resolve this Distinguished Name, or User Friendly Name, to its
   corresponding Presentation address.

   The logon sequence taken by an FTP Client when initiating a file
   transfer with an FTAM Responder is given below:

             % ftp gateway
             ftp> site Distinguished-Name-of-FTAM Responder
             ftp> user username
             ftp> pass password

   The "ftp gateway" command initiates the connection between the FTP
   Client and the gateway.  Once connected to the gateway, the FTP
   Client should identify the desired FTAM Responder service via the
   Responder's Distinguished Name, or User Friendly Name, which is
   resolved by an algorithm running on the Directory Services provider.
   This information is sent via a "site Distinguished-Name-of-FTAM
   Responder" or "site UFN-of-FTAM Responder" command.

   Upon receipt of a Distinguished Name or a User Friendly Name, it is
   the gateway's responsibility to resolve it to the Presentation
   Address associated with that name.  This resolution is done by
   contacting the OSI Directory (X.500 or local static table) and
   presenting the Distinguished Name or User Friendly Name.  Once the
   Presentation address is obtained, the gateway can attempt a
   connection with the ultimate destination file transfer service
   represented by this Presentation address.

   The userid is passed via the "user username" command, and the
   password is passed via the "pass password".  If the FTAM Responder
   requires a password, a password prompt should appear after issuing
   the "user username" command.  It is anticipated that stronger
   authentication mechanisms will be required for DoD gateways in the



Mindel & Slaski                                                 [Page 9]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   future.

   Using a specific example, suppose an FTAM Responder has the following
   Distinguished Name:

           CountryName          =         "US"
           Organization         =         "Open Networks"
           OrganizationalUnit   =         "Network Services"
           CommonName           =         "netwrx1"
           CommonName           =         "FTAM service"

   and the FTP-FTAM gateway is available at "washdc1-osigw.navy.mil".

   The FTP user action will appear as:

           % ftp washdc1-osigw.navy.mil
           ftp> site "c=US@o=Open Networks@ou=Network Services@cn=netwrx1
                @cn=FTAM service"
           ftp> user mindel
           ftp> pass ***********

   The "ftp washdc1-osigw.navy.mil" command initiates the connection
   between the FTP Client and the FTP-FTAM gateway at the Washington
   Navy Yard, Washington D.C.  Once connected, the OSI filestore at Open
   Networks is identified via its Distinguished Name, "@c=US@o=Open
   Networks@ou=Network Services@cn=netwrx1@cn=FTAM service".
   Alternatively, a User Friendly Name, such as:

           "netwrx1, Open Networks, us"

   can be specified, enabling the following FTP user action:

           % ftp washdc1-osigw.navy.mil
           ftp> site "netwrx1, Open Networks, us"
           ftp> user mindel
           ftp> pass ***********

   As this example indicates, use of an intermediate gateway is not
   transparent.  To partially alleviate this awkwardness, the gateway
   can be made more transparent through the registration of the FTAM
   host in the DNS using the address of the gateway [RFC1279].

   An example will clarify this point.  Suppose that the "netwrx1, Open
   Networks, us" FTAM host is registered in the TCP/IP DNS with the DN
   of "ftam-service.netwrx1.com" and the IP address of the "washdc1-
   osigw.navy.mil" gateway.  In this example, the following set of user
   actions is required:




Mindel & Slaski                                                [Page 10]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


           % ftp ftam-service.netwrx1.com
           ftp> user mindel
           ftp> pass ***********

   Since the "ftam-service.netwrx1.com" really points to the gateway
   address, the first command will connect the FTP Client to the
   gateway.  The gateway will then use the name (using [RFC1279]) to
   determine where the actual FTAM host is resident.  Gateway support
   for RFC1279 is recommended, but not required.

4.2. FTAM-Initiated Gateway Service

   The FTAM Initiator uses the FTAM-Initiated gateway service to utilize
   the resources of an FTP Server.

   To initiate a file transfer from an FTAM Initiator, the Initiator
   connects to the FTAM-Initiated gateway service via OSI.  The gateway
   then establishes a connection, via TCP/IP, to the FTP Server.  At
   this point, the user can initiate file transfer operations.

   The FTAM Initiator is responsible for providing the gateway with an
   authoritative DN of the desired TCP/IP filestore.  It is the
   responsibility of the gateway to resolve this DN to its corresponding
   IP address.

   The logon sequence taken by an FTAM Initiator when initiating a file
   transfer with an FTP Server is given below:

           % ftam gateway
           ftam> user username@DNS-string
           ftam> pass password

   The "ftam gateway" command initiates the connection between the FTAM
   Initiator and the gateway.  Once connected, userid and TCP/IP
   filestore are identified in the "username@DNS-string" argument to the
   user command.  If the FTP Server requires a password, a password
   prompt should appear after issuing the user command.

   The gateway should incorporate the BIND Resolver functionality so
   that upon receipt of a Domain Name, the Gateway FTP Client can
   resolve it via the distributed Domain Name System.

   Using a specific example, suppose that a FTP Server has the following
   Domain Name:  "ftp-service.netwrx1.com" and an FTP-FTAM gateway is
   available at:






Mindel & Slaski                                                [Page 11]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


           CountryName          =         "US"
           Organization         =         "GOV"
           OrganizationalUnit   =         "DOD"
           OrganizationalUnit   =         "DISA"
           Locality             =         "Washington Navy Yard"
           CommonName           =         "wnyosi7"

   The FTAM user action will appear as:

           % ftam @c=US@o=GOV@ou=DOD@ou=DISA@l=Washington Navy Yard
                  @cn=wnyosi7
           ftam> user mindel@ftp-service.netwrx1.com
           ftam> pass ***********

   Alternatively, a User Friendly Name could be used rather than the
   Distinguished Name.

   As mentioned in the previous section, "Use of the FTP-Initiated
   Gateway Service", use of an intermediate gateway is not transparent.
   The gateway can be made more transparent through the registration of
   the FTP host in the X.500 OSI Directory.  By querying the X.500 OSI
   Directory, the gateway can identify where the actual host is
   resident.

   For example, suppose that the FTP Server in the previous example
   ("ftp-service.netwrx1.com") is registered in the X.500 Directory with
   the following Distinguished Name:

           CountryName          =         "US"
           Organization         =         "Open Networks"
           OrganizationalUnit   =         "Network Services"
           CommonName           =         "netwrx1"
           CommonName           =         "FTP service"

   and the Presentation Address of the FTP-FTAM gateway.  This approach,
   described in [RFC1279], would permit the following user interactions:

           % ftam @c=US@o=Open Networks@ou=Network Services
                  @cn=netwrx1@cn=FTP Service"
           ftam> user mindel
           ftam> pass ***********

4.3. Summary of Usage

   As shown in the discussions of the FTP-Initiated and FTAM-Initiated
   Gateway Services, the gateway user does not have access to the
   gateway filesystem; he merely makes use of the gateway logon
   procedure to specify the ultimate destination userid and password.



Mindel & Slaski                                                [Page 12]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   Two methods of interaction with the gateway were described.  In the
   former, the user must:

       1. Be aware that a gateway is required to reach the
          destination FTP or FTAM host.

       2. Determine which gateway is most appropriate for their
          respective source-destination pair.

       3. Explicitly connect to the gateway host prior to connecting
          to the destination host.

   Needless to say, the exchange of files between FTP and FTAM hosts
   requires more effort than that required for the exchange of files
   between a pair of hosts utilizing the same file transfer protocol.

   The latter, more transparent method does not necessarily require that
   the user determine which gateway is most appropriate for their
   respective source-destination pair.  In fact, filestore service
   providers are registered using the address of a predetermined
   gateway.  With this approach, the user:

       1. Must be aware that a gateway is required to reach the
          destination FTP or FTAM host.

       2. Need not determine which gateway is most appropriate to
          access their ultimate destination host.

       3. Need not explicitly connect to the gateway prior to
          connecting to the destination FTP or FTAM host.

5. Gateway State Variables and Transitions

   As described, the FTP-FTAM gateway provides two sets of services:
   FTP-Initiated and FTAM-Initiated.  Each service has its own mutually
   exclusive set of state variables and transitions that
   deterministically define the actions of the gateway.  Gateway support
   for these state variables and transitions is required.

   For conciseness in this discussion, FTP-Initiated will be abbreviated
   with "FTP-I", and FTAM-Initiated will be abbreviated with "FTAM-I".

   Concerning error conditions, if a connection is dropped when the
   gateway is in any state other than FTP-I:Initial-State or FTAM-
   I:Initial-State, then the gateway will issue a fatal error message to
   the host with the remaining connection, and then drop that
   connection.  If the remaining host is an FTP Client, then the gateway
   will send an ABOR, QUIT, and 426 reply code (Connection closed,

   transfer aborted).  If it is an FTAM Initiator, then the gateway will
   send an F-P-ABORT with a <Diagnostic> value with identifier 1011
   (Lower layer failure), as well as any known <Further Details>.

   Other error conditions are not addressed in this discussion.

5.1. FTP-Initiated Gateway Service

                                Gateway is waiting for an FTP Client to
                                issue a USER command in order to
                                proceed with connection establishment
                                with remote FTAM Responder.  If SITE or
                                ACCT commands are sent while waiting
                                for USER command, save arguments for
                                subsequent use.

  FTP-I:Wait-for-PASS           Gateway has already received USER
                                command from FTP Client, as well as

6. Document Type Support

   The set of FTAM document types supported by the FTP-FTAM gateway is a
   subset of the document types identified in the Stable Implementation
   Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Protocols:  Part 9 - FTAM
   Phase 2, produced by the March 1992 Open Systems Environment
   Implementors' Workshop [NIST92].  This subset was chosen for its
   equivalence to those document types supported by FTP.  The set
   includes:

                FTAM-1    "ISO FTAM Unstructured text file

                FTAM-3    "ISO FTAM Unstructured binary file

                NBS-9     "NBS-9 FTAM File directory file"

      FTAM document types map to FTP document types as follows:

                FTAM      <->       FTP
                ----------------------------------

                FTAM-1    <->       ASCII

                FTAM-3    <->       8 bit binary

                NBS-9     <->       Directory

   Gateway support for FTAM-1 and FTAM-2 is required, whereas support
   for NBS-9 is recommended.

6.1. Notes on NBS-9

   NBS-9 is optional in GOSIP versions 1 and 2 [NIST91].  NBS-9 will be
   superseded by its replacement when ISO/IEC ISP 10607-2 and ISO/IEC
   ISP 10607-2/Amendment 1 are published [NIST92].

   For conformance to NBS-9, an FTAM Responder is only required to
   return the <Filename> file attribute, subject to local security and
   access control.  All other requested attributes need not be returned.

   Systems supporting the NBS-9 document type shall make available an
   NBS-9 document called 'DIRLIS'.  This document can be used to obtain
   a listing of files and their associated attributes from a remote
   Filestore.

7. Functional Comparison of FTP and FTAM

   A comprehensive comparison of the services offered by FTP and FTAM is
   beyond the scope of this specification.  What follows is an analysis
   of several key points.  Refer to [NIST 86a] and [ROSE90] for a more
   complete discourse on this topic.

   FTAM is not a superset of FTP; each protocol has functions that only
   it performs.  The set of FTAM functions is, however, larger than the
   set of FTP functions.

   FTP combines file management and file transfer into one protocol
   engine, whereas FTAM separates management and transfer as they relate
   to files.

   The file transfer services of both FTP and FTAM expect a reliable
   underlying end-to-end service.  At a minimum, this service includes
   the capability to transfer entire files between remote hosts and to
   display remote filenames.

   In addition to this basic file transfer service, FTAM supports the
   capability to:  access a few records from a file server, create a
   network file system (similar to Sun's Network File System), handle
   printing and spooling, and access remote database records.  FTP does
   not support these additional capabilities.

   FTP uses TELNET services to set up a connection between the FTP
   Client and FTP Server.  A three-digit reply code followed by
   explanatory text indicates the status of the preceding request and
   provides diagnostic information explaining each transaction.

   FTAM relies on the Association Control Service Element (ACSE) to
   start and stop the network for network file interaction.  Generally,
   the ASCE establishes the application association and related
   application context needed to support the FTAM protocol.

   The FTAM protocol is modularized so as to keep the allowable number
   of actions in any particular state relatively small.  There are many
   more possible sequences of FTP operations than possible sequences of
   FTAM operations [NIST86].

   Because FTAM is more robust than FTP, FTAM allows greater flexibility
   for conveying information about files.  FTAM deals only with aspects
   of application processes, and leaves data representation and data
   management facilities to other OSI service elements.

   In contrast to the Client/Server model present in the FTP scheme,
   FTAM is based on the Initiator/Responder model.  The key distinction

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   is that once the FTAM Initiator has established a connection with a
   remote host, either the Initiator or Responder can request services
   of the other.  In the FTP realm, the Client both initiates a
   connection and requests all services.

   The FTP Client knows the real properties of the remote host
   filesystem.  FTAM, in contrast, embraces a conceptual model of a
   filesystem, labeled a virtual filestore model.  The virtual filestore
   is a collection of files, each of which has a name that uniquely
   identifies it.  Each file has a set of attributes, such as ownership
   information and contents, which is the data associated with the file.
   One file attribute is the <Contents Type> of the file, typically of
   value "FTAM-1", "FTAM-3", or "NBS-9".  The FTAM Initiator only knows
   the properties of the corresponding Responder and virtual filestore,
   not the real properties of the filesystem on the remote host.

7.1. Loss of Functionality

   As happens whenever two dissimilar protocols, or languages for that
   matter, are translated, some loss of functionality is inevitable.
   With reference to the FTP-FTAM gateway, several of the most blatant
   losses of functionality are:

        1. Diagnostics passed between protocols may not be precisely
           translated.

        2. The FTAM partial file (record) transfer may not be
           supported.

        3. Some FTAM attributes are not supported by FTP.

   The primary goal of the gateway protocol mappings are to minimize
   this loss of functionality. As this gateway specification and
   subsequent implementations evolve, means to partially overcome loss
   of functionality may become more obvious.  For example, the gateway
   may be able to emulate file record transfers between FTAM Initiators
   and FTP Servers.

8. Mapping of Protocol Functions and Representations

   The mappings presented are based upon the FTAM protocol
   implementation as defined in Stable Implementation Agreements for
   Open Systems Interconnection Protocols:  Part 9 - FTAM Phase 2,
   produced by the March 1992 Open Systems Environment Implementors'
   Workshop [NIST92], and in [ISO8571-1], [ISO8571-2],[ISO8571-
   3],[ISO8571-4], and [ISO8571-5].  The FTP protocol as defined in
   Request for Comments [RFC959].   The mappings are strongly influenced
   by the work of M. A. Wallace et. al. at NIST [NIST86] and John Scott



Mindel & Slaski                                                [Page 20]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   at MITRE [MITRE87].

   A key goal of the mappings presented in this document is to minimize
   the loss of functionality between the two protocols.  The specific
   approach taken to implement the mappings is left to the discretion of
   the gateway implementor.  The focus of the protocol function and
   representation mappings is on non-error encumbered processing.  The
   mapping of diagnostic and error messages is treated separately in
   section 9.

   At a minimum, the FTAM implementation in the FTP-FTAM gateway support
   for Implementation Profiles T1 (Simple File Transfer) and M1
   (Management), as defined in [NIST92], is required.  These
   Implementation Profiles correspond to the A/111 and A/13 Profiles of
   Standards Promotion and Application Group in Europe, respectively
   [NIST92].

   At a minimum, the gateway support for the following is required:

      ASCII and 8 bit binary file types.  It should also support FTP
      File Stream Mode.

      The following FTAM document types: FTAM-1 (unstructured text
      file), FTAM-3 (unstructured binary file), and NBS-9 (set of
      directory entries).

   POSIX file naming and organization conventions are assumed in these
   mappings; i.e., files in the systems are assumed to be organized in a
   hierarchical structure in which all of the non-terminal nodes are
   directories and all of the terminal nodes are any other type of file.

   The following terminology is used in the mapping specifications:

      argument .......FTP Service Command argument, as used in [RFC959].

      parameter ......FTAM Service Primitive parameters and attributes,
                      as enumerated in Tables 6, 50, and 51 of [ISO8571-
                      3].

   The following notation is used in the mapping specifications:

      Arguments and parameters are enclosed in angle brackets; e.g.,
      <Action Result>

      Values of arguments and parameters are enclosed in quotation
      marks; e.g., "Success"

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


      FTP Service Commands and FTAM Primitives are in uppercase; e.g., F-
      INITIALIZE

8.1.  FTP-Initiated Gateway Service

   The protocol mapping between FTP and FTAM may be one-to-zero (i.e.,
   not mappable), one-to-one, or one-to-many.

   The general steps taken by the FTP-FTAM gateway to provide the FTP-
   Initiated service are:

        1. Accept an FTP Client request at the FTP Server side of the
           gateway service.

        2. Map the request to the (set of) corresponding FTAM
           Initiator function(s).

        3. Acting as an FTAM Initiator, send the FTAM Initiator
           function(s) to the FTAM Responder.

        4. Accept information returned to the FTAM Initiator side of
           the gateway.  This information originated at the FTAM
           Responder.

        5. Map this returned information to the protocol form
           understood by the FTP Server side of the gateway.

        6. Send this returned information from the FTP Server side of
           the gateway to the FTP Client.

   For each FTP protocol function, the FTAM protocol functions required
   to map it are identified:

        Note:
        a. Default to ASCII if no <type code> argument is provided.

8.1.33. USER

        1. Set <Initiator Identity> parameter for issuing F-INITIALIZE
           to FTAM Responder.
        2. If the destination address was specified in the Domain Name
           used to attach to the gateway, use it to set the value of
           the <Called Presentation Address> parameter of the
           to-be-issued F-INITIALIZE command.
        3. If the destination address is not known, check if it was
           specified in a previously issued SITE command.  If
           available, set <Called Presentation Address> parameter for
           issuing F-INITIALIZE to FTAM Responder.
        4. If the destination address is still not available, check if
           it is encoded in the user identity (e.g., user@host). If
           encoded, set <Called Presentation Address> parameter for
           issuing F-INITIALIZE to FTAM Responder using the "host"
           portion.
        5. If no destination address is available, proceed to step 7.
        6. Prompt user for password.
        7. Translate FTAM Responder <Action Result> and <Diagnostic>
           parameters to equivalent FTP reply code(s) and send reply
           code(s) to FTP Client.
        8. Translate FTP Client reply codes to equivalent FTAM <Action
           Result> and <Diagnostic> parameters and send parameters to
           FTAM Responder.

        Note:
        a. A USER command should be acceptable in any state.
        b. Multiple mechanisms are available for specifying the
           destination address: 1) Domain Name used in connecting to
           gateway (see section 4, Use of Gateway Services); 2) SITE
           command argument; and 3) user@host format.

8.2. FTAM-Initiated Gateway Service

   The protocol mapping between FTP and FTAM may be one-to-zero (i.e.,
   not mappable), one-to-one, or one-to-many.

   The general steps taken by the FTP-FTAM gateway to provide the FTAM-
   Initiated service are:

        1. Accept an FTAM Initiator request at the FTAM Responder side
           of the gateway.

        2. Map the request to the (set of) corresponding FTP Client

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


           function(s).

        3. Acting as an FTP Client, send the FTP Client function(s) to
           the FTP Server.

        4. Accept information returned to the FTP Client side of the
           gateway.  This information originated at the FTP Server.

        5. Map this returned information to a form understood by the
           FTAM Responder side of the gateway.

        6. Send this returned information from the FTAM Responder side
           of the gateway to the FTAM Initiator.

   For each FTAM protocol function, the FTP protocol functions required
   to map it are identified:

        3. Translate FTP Server reply code to equivalent FTAM
           Responder <Action Result> and <Diagnostic> parameters and
           send parameters to FTAM Initiator.
        4. Translate FTAM Initiator <Action Result> and <Diagnostic>
           parameters to equivalent FTP reply codes and send reply
           codes to FTP Server.

8.3. F-WRITE REQ

        1. Save bulk transfer specification parameter from PDU.
        2. Send NOOP to FTP Server to receive status information.
        3. If the <Bulk Data Transfer Specification, FADU Operation>
           parameter has a value of "File Extend", then send an APPE
           to the FTP Server, otherwise send a STOR to the FTP Server.
        4. If reply code from FTP Server is 200, then accept FTP data
           connection; otherwise send F-CANCEL REQ to FTAM Initiator.
        5. Translate FTP Server reply code to equivalent FTAM Responder
           <Action Result> and <Diagnostic> parameters and send
           parameters to FTAM Initiator.
        6. Translate FTAM Initiator <Action Result> and <Diagnostic>
           parameters to equivalent FTP reply codes and send reply
           codes to FTP Server.

9.  Mapping between FTP Reply Codes and FTAM Parameters

   The focus of the protocol function and representation mappings,
   presented in the previous sections, is on non-error encumbered
   processing.  Though appropriate responses are designated in many
   cases, it is intended that a more thorough use of responses will be
   incorporated into gateway implementations.

   The purpose of this section is to provide a set of mappings between
   FTAM responses (<Action Result> and <Diagnostic>) and FTP responses
   (reply codes).




Mindel & Slaski                                                [Page 47]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   The <Action Result> parameter of the FTAM File Service primitives
   conveys information which summarizes that available in the
   <Diagnostic> parameter.  The value is never less than the most severe
   diagnostic value.  The valid values of this parameter are "Success",
   "Transient Error", and "Permanent Error".  The FTP response text
   should be supplied in the <Further Details> field of the
   <Diagnostics> sequence in the FTAM response and abort messages.

   An FTAM <Action Result> "Success" may be accompanied by a
   <Diagnostic> with value of "Informative Error Type".  These "Success"
   diagnostic messages are associated with error type 0 in the table
   below (and in [ISO8571-3]).  Error type 1 indicates a transient
   error, while type 2 indicates a permanent error.

   An FTP reply consists of a three digit number followed by some text.
   The number is defined as a 3-digit code, each digit of which has a
   special significance.  The first digit conveys approximately the same
   information as the FTAM <Action Result> parameter; i.e., positive,
   transient negative, or permanent negative.

   The FTP specification document [RFC959] explicitly states that the
   list of reply codes should not be expanded beyond that which is
   presented in [RFC959].  This requirement is adhered to in the
   mappings presented in this document.

9.1.  FTP Reply Codes to FTAM Parameters

   This section presents the set of mappings between FTP reply codes and
   their equivalent FTAM action and diagnostic parameters.  Gateway
   support for these mappings is recommended, but not required.  The
   following abbreviations are used for FTAM action parameter values:

        trans   =    transient error
        perman  =    permanent error

9.2.  FTAM Parameters to FTP Reply Codes

   This section presents the set of mappings between FTAM diagnostic
   parameters and their equivalent FTP reply codes.  Gateway support for
   these mappings is recommended, but not required.  As previously
   mentioned, type 0 is an informative error type that may be returned
   with a "Success" action result, type 1 is a transient error type, and
   type 2 is a permanent error type.

9.3.  Future Mapping Problem

   At some point in the future, the FTAM <Responding Presentation
   Address> parameter may be used for purposes other than the current
   use of passing the final destination address in the FTAM-Initiated
   gateway service [NIST86].  If this happens, the destination address
   will have to be passed in another location, such as in the "@host"
   portion of the <Initiator Identity>.  Currently, the FTP-FTAM gateway
   specification permits either mechanism for storage of the ultimate
   destination address.

9.4.  Error Handling

   The minimal acceptable solution for FTAM-Initiated service errors is
   to map FTP failures to FTAM "Unrecoverable error" and return the FTP
   diagnostic string in the FTAM <Further Details> field.  Similarly for
   FTP-Initiated service errors, the minimal acceptable solution is to
   return reply code 221, "Service closing control connection, Logged
   out if appropriate".  While this minimal solution is acceptable, the
   recommended approach for Gateway developers is to implement the
   mappings presented in Section 9.1, FTP Reply Codes to FTAM
   Parameters, and Section 9.2, FTAM Parameters to FTP Reply Codes.

10.  Implementation and Configuration Guidelines

   The intent of this specification is to specify the required
   characteristics and functions of an FTP-FTAM gateway.  The specific
   approach taken to realize these specifications in an operational
   gateway are left to the discretion of the implementor.  We do take
   the liberty, however, of suggesting several ideas concerning the
   configuration and implementation of such gateways.

10.1.  Robustness

   The gateway should be robust enough to handle situations where a
   subset of the FTP and/or FTAM protocols are implemented on a host.

   The gateway should support multiple concurrent FTP and FTAM
   connections.




Mindel & Slaski                                                [Page 54]

RFC 1415             FTP-FTAM Gateway Specification         January 1993


   These are requirements for gateway implementations.

10.2.  Well-Known TCP/IP Port

   It is recommended that the FTP-Initiated gateway process listen on
   TCP/IP port 21, the well-known port for FTP listener processes.  As
   the gateway computer is primarily intended to provide gateway
   services,  use of this port will alleviate the need for gateway users
   to specify the desired port when they connect to the gateway.  The
   standard FTP server listener process can then be moved to another
   port that is known to those users (e.g., System Administrators)
   requiring FTP-to-FTP access to the gateway computer.

10.3.  Gateway Listener Processes

   To simplify the administrative overhead on the gateway computer
   system, it is recommended that the FTP-Initiated service and FTAM-
   Initiated gateway listener processes be merged into a single
   executable module.  This single daemon will act as the one and only
   gateway listener processes.  As connections were established with
   hosts, other processes would be created.

10.4.  Implementation Testing

   To assist in the development and evaluation of FTP-FTAM gateway
   prototypes, NIST has developed a test system to evaluate a gateway's
   conformance to the protocol standards [NIST88].

10.5.  POSIX File Naming and Organization

   The OSI profiles do not define a standard manner for an FTAM
   Responder to return file names.

   To avoid unnecessary complexity, proprietary file systems are not
   addressed in these mappings.  Gateway support for POSIX file naming
   and organization conventions is required; i.e., files are assumed to
   be organized in a hierarchical structure in which all of the non-
   terminal nodes are directories and all of the terminal nodes are any
   other type of file.

11.  Security Considerations

   The gateway system may place the burden of authentication on the
   destination system.  However, the gateway must accommodate the
   passing through of all authentication parameters.  The authentication
   parameters of each protocol are applied at the destination and no
   additional parameters are needed for authentication at the gateway.
   As such, no gateway password file is required to support gateway

   functions.

   It is anticipated that the requirement for a strong authentication
   mechanism will soon replace the most currently used, userid and
   password mechanism.  The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has
   already prototyped and has plans field a Message Secure Protocol
   (MSP) as part of the Defense Message System (DMS) Program which will
   soon become the Department of Defense (DoD) mandatory messaging
   system.  MSP utilizes a public key encryption-like mechanism which
   will be used to authenticate users and allow signed operations.  The
   current philosophy is to use this same mechanism for all
   authentication and access control situations, such as logging onto
   remote hosts or gateways.  Detailed specifications for Pre-MSP, used
   in the unclassified though sensitive arena, are scheduled to be
   published in the first quarter of 1993.  The requirement for gateways
   to process PMSP and MSP strong authentication mechanisms will be part
   of all future DoD procurements.
