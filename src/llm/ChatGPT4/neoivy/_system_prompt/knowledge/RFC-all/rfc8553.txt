                         DNS AttrLeaf Changes:
         Fixing Specifications That Use Underscored Node Names

Abstract

   Using an underscore for a prefix creates a space for constrained
   interoperation of resource records.  Original uses of an underscore
   character as a domain node name prefix were specified without the
   benefit of an IANA registry.  This produced an entirely uncoordinated
   set of name-creation activities, all drawing from the same namespace.
   A registry for these names has now been defined by RFC 8552.
   However, the existing specifications that use underscored naming need
   to be modified in order to be in line with the new registry.  This
   document specifies those changes.  The changes preserve existing
   software and operational practice, while adapting the specifications
   for those practices to the newer underscore registry model.

1.  Introduction

   Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name
   [RFC1035] prefix, which creates a space for constrained
   interpretation of resource records, were specified without the
   benefit of an IANA registry [IANA-reg].  This produced an entirely
   uncoordinated set of name-creation activities, all drawing from the
   same namespace.  A registry has now been defined (see Section 4 of
   [RFC8552]); the RFC that defined it discusses the background for the
   use of underscored domain names [RFC8552].

RFC 8553                    DNS AttrLeaf Fix                  March 2019


   The basic model for underscored name registration, as specified in
   [RFC8552], is to have each registry entry be unique in terms of the
   combination of a resource record type and a "global" (highest-level)
   underscored node name; that is, the node name beginning with an
   underscore that is the closest to the DNS root.

   The specifications describing the existing uses of underscored naming
   do not reflect the existence of this integrated registry.  For the
   new reader or the new editor of one of those documents, there is
   currently nothing signaling that the underscored name(s) defined in
   the document are now processed through an IANA registry.  This
   document remedies that, by marking such a published document with an
   update that indicates the nature of the change.

   Further, the documents that define the SRV [RFC2782] and URI
   [RFC7553] DNS resource records provide a meta-template for
   underscored name assignments, partially based on separate registries
   [RFC6335].  For the portion that selects the global (highest-level)
   underscored node name, this perpetuates uncoordinated assignment
   activities by separate technical specifications, out of the same
   namespace.  This document remedies that by providing detail for
   revisions to the SRV and URI specifications to bring their use in
   line with the single, integrated "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS
   Node Names" registry.

   The result of these changes preserves existing software and
   operations practices while adapting the technical specifications to
   the newer underscore registry model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Underscored RRset Use in Specifications

   The use of underscored node names is specific to each RR TYPE that is
   being scoped.  Each name defines a place but does not define the
   rules for what appears underneath that place, either as additional
   underscored naming or as a leaf node with resource records.  Details
   for those rules are provided by specifications for individual RR
   TYPEs.  The sections below describe the way that existing underscored
   names are used with the RR TYPEs that they name.

2.1.  TXT RRset



      NOTE -  Documents falling into this category include: [RFC5518],
         [RFC5617], [RFC6120], [RFC6376], [RFC6763], [RFC7208], and
         [RFC7489].

   This section provides a generic approach for changes to existing
   specifications that define straightforward use of underscored node
   names when scoping the use of a TXT RRset.  The approach provides the
   information needed for adapting such specifications to the use of the
   IANA "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry
   [RFC8552].  Hence, the approach is meant both as an update to these
   existing specifications and as guidance for changes when those
   documents are revised.

   For any document that specifies the use of a TXT RRset under one or
   more underscored names, the global node name is expected to be
   registered in the IANA "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node
   Names" registry [RFC8552].  An effort has been made to locate
   existing documents that do this, to register the global underscored
   node names, and to list them in the initial set of names added to the
   registry.

   If a public specification defines use of a TXT RRset and calls for
   the use of an underscored node name, here is a template of suggested
   text for registering the global underscored node name -- the one
   closest to the root -- that can be used through the IANA
   Considerations section of the specification:

      "Per [RFC8552], please add the following entry to the "Underscored
      and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry:"

   +--------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | RR     | _NODE NAME     | Reference                               |
   | Type   |                |                                         |
   +--------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
   | TXT    | _{DNS node     | {citation for the document making the   |
   |        | name}          | addition}                               |
   +--------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+

2.2.  SRV RRset

      NOTE -  Documents falling into this category include:

         [RFC3263], [RFC3529], [RFC3620], [RFC3832], [RFC3887],
         [RFC3958], [RFC4120], [RFC4227], [RFC4386], [RFC4387],
         [RFC4976], [RFC5026], [RFC5328], [RFC5389], [RFC5415],
         [RFC5555], [RFC5679], [RFC5766], [RFC5780], [RFC5804],
         [RFC5864], [RFC5928], and [RFC6186].

   Specification of the SRV resource record [RFC2782] provides a
   template for use of underscored node names.  The global node name is
   characterized as referencing the 'protocol' that is associated with
   SRV RRset usage.

   This section provides a generic approach for changes to existing
   specifications that define the use of an SRV RRset.  The approach
   provides the information needed for adapting such specifications to
   the use of the IANA "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names"
   registry [RFC8552].  Hence, the approach is meant both as an update
   to these existing specifications and as guidance for changes when
   those documents are revised.

   For any document that specifies the use of an SRV RRset, the global
   ('protocol') underscored node name is expected to be registered in
   the IANA "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry
   [RFC8552].  An effort has been made to locate existing documents that
   do this, to register the global underscored node names, and to list
   them in the initial set of names added to the registry.

   If a public specification defines use of an SRV RRset and calls for
   the use of an underscored node name, here is a template of suggested
   text for registering the global underscored node name -- the one
   closest to the root -- that can be used through the IANA
   Considerations section of the specification:

2.3.  URI RRset

   Specification of the URI resource record [RFC7553] provides a
   template for use of underscored node names.  The global node name is
   characterized as naming the 'protocol' that is associated with URI RR
   usage or by reversing an Enumservice sequence [RFC6117].

   This section provides a generic approach for changes to existing
   specifications that define use of a URI RRset.  The approach provides
   the information needed for adapting such specifications to the use of
   the IANA "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry
   [RFC8552].  Hence, the approach is meant both as an update to these
   existing specifications and as guidance for changes when those
   documents are revised.

   For any document that specifies the use of a URI RRset, the global
   ('protocol' or highest-level Enumservice) underscored node name is
   expected to be registered in the IANA "Underscored and Globally
   Scoped DNS Node Names" registry [RFC8552].  An effort has been made
   to locate existing documents that do this, to register the global
   underscored node names, and to list them in the initial set of names
   added to the registry.

   If a public specification defines use of a URI RRset and calls for

3.  Underscored Template Specifications

3.1.  SRV Specification Changes

   The specification for a domain name, under which an SRV resource
   record [RFC2782] appears, provides a template for use of underscored
   node names.  The global underscored node name is characterized as
   indicating the 'protocol' that is associated with SRV RR usage.

   The text of [RFC2782] is changed as described below.  In addition,
   note that a normative reference to RFC 8552 is added to the
   References section of RFC 2782.

      OLD:

   The format of the SRV RR

    Here is the format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33:
          _Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port Target
    ...
    Proto
         The symbolic name of the desired protocol, with an underscore
         (_) prepended to prevent collisions with DNS labels that occur
         in nature.  _TCP and _UDP are at present the most useful values
         for this field, though any name defined by Assigned Numbers or
         locally may be used (as for Service).  The Proto is case
         insensitive.










Crocker                   Best Current Practice                 [Page 7]

RFC 8553                    DNS AttrLeaf Fix                  March 2019


      NEW:

         The format of the SRV RR

         Here is the format of the SRV RR, whose DNS type code is 33:

            "_Service._Proto.Name TTL Class SRV Priority Weight Port
            Target"

            _..._

         Proto

            The symbolic name of the desired protocol with an underscore
            (e.g., "_name") prepended to prevent collisions with DNS
            labels that occur in nature. _TCP and _UDP are at present
            the most useful values for this field.  The Proto is case
            insensitive.

            The SRV RRset 'protocol' (global) underscored node name
            SHOULD be registered in the IANA "Underscored and Globally
            Scoped DNS Node Names" registry [RFC8552].

3.2.  URI Specification Changes

   Specification for the domain name (under which a URI resource record
   [RFC7553] occurs) is similar to that for the SRV resource record
   [RFC2782], although the text refers only to 'service' name, rather
   than distinguishing 'service' from 'protocol'.  Further, the URI RR
   specification permits alternative underscored naming schemes:

      One matches what is used for SRV, with the global underscored node
      name called 'protocol'.

      The other is based on a reversing of an Enumservice [RFC6117]
      sequence.

   Text of [RFC7553] is changed as described below.  In addition, a
   normative reference to RFC 8552 is added to the References section of
   RFC 7553.

RFC 8553                    DNS AttrLeaf Fix                  March 2019


      OLD:

   4.1.  Owner Name, Class, and Type

   The URI owner name is subject to special conventions.

   Just like the SRV RR [RFC2782], the URI RR has service information
   encoded in its owner name.  In order to encode the service for a
   specific owner name, one uses service parameters.  Valid service
   parameters are those registered by IANA in the "Service Name and
   Transport Protocol Port Number Registry" [RFC6335] or as "Enumservice
   ---
   Registrations [RFC6117].  The Enumservice Registration parameters are
   reversed (i.e., subtype(s) before type), prepended with an underscore
   (_), and prepended to the owner name in separate labels.  The
   underscore is prepended to the service parameters to avoid collisions
   with DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is reversed to
   make it possible to do delegations, if needed, to different zones
   (and therefore providers of DNS).

   For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service with
   ENUM Service Parameter "A:B:C" for host example.com.  Then we would
   query for (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_C._B._A.example.com","URI").

   As another example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service
   with Service Name "A" and Transport Protocol "B" for host
   example.com.  Then we would query for
   (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_A._B.example.com","URI").

      NEW:

         4.1.  Owner Name, Class, and Type

         The URI owner name is subject to special conventions.

         As for the SRV RRset [RFC2782], the URI RRset global (highest-
         level) underscored node name SHOULD be registered in the IANA
         "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry
         [RFC8552].

         Just like the SRV RRset, the URI RRset has service information
         encoded in its owner name.  In order to encode the service for
         a specific owner name, one uses service parameters.  Valid
         service parameters are:

         +  Those registered by IANA in the "Service Name and Transport
            Protocol Port Number Registry" [RFC6335].  The underscore is
            prepended to the service parameters to avoid collisions with



Crocker                   Best Current Practice                 [Page 9]

RFC 8553                    DNS AttrLeaf Fix                  March 2019


            DNS labels that occur in nature, and the order is reversed
            to make it possible to do delegations, if needed, to
            different zones (and therefore providers of DNS).

         +  Those listed in "Enumservice Registrations" [RFC6117].  The
            Enumservice Registration parameters are reversed (i.e.,
            subtype(s) before type), prepended with an underscore (e.g.,
            "_name"), and prepended to the owner name in separate
            labels.  The highest-level (global) underscored Enumservice
            name becomes the global name per RFC 8552 to register.

         For example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a service
         with ENUM Service Parameter "A:B:C" for host example.com.  Then
         we would query for
         (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_C._B._A.example.com","URI").

         As another example, suppose we are looking for the URI for a
         service with Service Name "A" and Transport Protocol "B" for
         host example.com.  Then we would query for
         (QNAME,QTYPE)=("_A._B.example.com","URI").

3.3.  DNSSEC Signaling Specification Changes

   "Signaling Trust Anchor Knowledge in DNS Security Extensions
   (DNSSEC)" [RFC8145] defines a use of DNS node names that effectively
   consumes all names beginning with the string "_ta-" when using the
   NULL RR in the query.

   Text of Section 5.1, "Query Format", of RFC 8145 is changed as
   described below.  In addition, a normative reference to RFC 8552 is
   added to the References section of RFC 8145.

      OLD:

   For example, a validating DNS resolver ...
                              QNAME=_ta-4444.

      NEW:

         For example, a validating DNS resolver ...  "QNAME=_ta-4444".

         Under the NULL RR, an entry is registered in the IANA
         "Underscored and Globally Scoped DNS Node Names" registry
         [RFC8552] for all node names beginning with "_ta-".
