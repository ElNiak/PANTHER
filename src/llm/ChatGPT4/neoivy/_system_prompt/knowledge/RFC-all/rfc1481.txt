           IAB Recommendation for an Intermediate Strategy to
                     Address the Issue of Scaling

Status of this Memo

Recommendation

   Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) proposes strategies for address
   assignment of the existing IP address space with a view to conserve
   the address space and stem the explosive growth of routing tables in
   default-route-free routers run by transit routing domain providers
   [1].  CIDR is proposed as an immediate term strategy to extend the
   life of the current 32 bit IP address space.  This strategy presumes
   that a suitable long term solution is being addressed within the
   Internet technical community.

   The basic components of the CIDR plan are: management of the
   allocation of Internet address space and provision of a mechanism for
   aggregation of routing information.  The IP community has published
   several RFCs and Internet-Drafts which describe the architecture for
   IP address assignment and routing protocols which will promote the
   deployment of CIDR.  These documents have led to changes in the way
   network address are allocated and have prompted enhancements to the
   inter-domain and intra-domain routing protocols.

   With the CIDR prompted changes in the management of the allocation of
   the Internet address space, allocation of blocks of Class C numbers
   leads to an explosion of the routing tables.  So, it is important
   that the techniques for aggregating information in the routing
   protocols keep pace with the change in the allocation of IP numbers.

   The IAB endorses the CIDR architecture and its implementation.  In
   addition, the IAB supports the actions taken by the IANA and
   InterNIC, the router vendors, and the network operators to implement
   CIDR to address the scaling problem that we are facing with the
   growth of the Internet.
