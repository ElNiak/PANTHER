 A Property Types Registry for the Authentication-Results Header Field

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 7001 by creating a registry for property
   types in the Authentication-Results header field, used in email
   authentication work, rather than limiting participants to using the
   original, small set of fixed values.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC7001] defines the email Authentication-Results header field that
   presents the results of an authentication effort in a machine-
   readable format.  The header field creates a place to collect the
   output from authentication processes that are disjoint from later
   processes that might use the output, such as analysis, filtering, or
   sorting mechanisms.

   The specification in that document enumerated a small set of types of
   properties that can be reported using this mechanism.  There has
   emerged a desire to report types of properties about a message
   through this mechanism.  Accordingly, this document updates the
   specification to allow for additional property types ("ptypes")
   beyond the original set and creates a registry where new ones can be
   listed and their defining documents referenced.

2.  Updated "ptype" Definition

   Advanced Backus Naur Form (ABNF) is defined in [RFC5234].

   The ABNF in Section 2.2 of [RFC7001] is updated as follows:

       ptype = Keyword
             ; indicates whether the property being evaluated was
             ; a parameter to an [SMTP] command, was a value taken
             ; from a message header field, was some property of
             ; the message body, or was some other property evaluated by
             ; the receiving Message Transfer Agent (MTA)

   The ABNF token "Keyword" is defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC5321].

RFC 7410          Authentication-Results Property Types    December 2014


   Legal values of "ptype" are as defined in the IANA "Email
   Authentication Property Types" registry (see Section 3).  The initial
   values are as follows, matching those defined in [RFC7001]:

   body:  Indicates information that was extracted from the body of the
      message.  This might be an arbitrary string of bytes, a hash of a
      string of bytes, a Uniform Resource Identifier, or some other
      content of interest.

   header:  Indicates information that was extracted from the header of
      the message.  This might be the value of a header field or some
      portion of a header field.

   policy:  A local policy mechanism was applied that augments or
      overrides the result returned by the authentication mechanism.
      See Section 2.3 of [RFC7001].

   smtp:  Indicates information that was extracted from an SMTP command
      that was used to relay the message.

   When a consumer of this header field encounters a "ptype" that it
   does not understand, it ignores the result reported with that
   "ptype".

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the "Email Authentication Property Types" sub-
   registry within the existing "Email Authentication Parameters"
   registry.  Entries in this registry are subject to the Expert Review
   rules as described in [RFC5226].  Each entry in the registry requires
   the following values:

   o  The "ptype" token to be registered, which must fit within the ABNF
      described in Section 2.

   o  A brief description of what sort of information this "ptype" is
      meant to cover.

   o  An optional reference to the defining document.  This is
      recommended, but not required.

RFC 7410          Authentication-Results Property Types    December 2014


   The initial entries in this table are as follows, taken from
   [RFC7001]:

       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
       | ptype  | Definition  | Description                            |
       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
       | body   | RFC 7001    | The property being reported was found  |
       |        | Section 2.2 | in the body of the message.            |
       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
       | header | RFC 7001    | The property being reported was found  |
       |        | Section 2.2 | in a header field of the message.      |
       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
       | policy | RFC 7001    | The property being reported relates to |
       |        | Section 2.3 | a locally defined policy.              |
       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+
       | smtp   | RFC 7001    | The property being reported is a       |
       |        | Section 2.2 | parameter to an SMTP command used to   |
       |        |             | relay the message.                     |
       +--------+-------------+----------------------------------------+

   For new entries, the Designated Expert needs to assure that the
   description provided for the new entry adequately describes the
   intended use.  An example would be helpful to include in the entry's
   defining document, if any, although entries in the "Email
   Authentication Methods" registry or the "Email Authentication Result
   Names" registry might also serve as examples of intended use.

4.  Security Considerations

   It is unknown how legacy code, which expects one of a fixed set of
   "ptype" tokens, will handle new tokens as they begin to appear.
   There are typically two options: prevent delivery of the message, or
   ignore those portions of the field that use unknown "ptype" tokens
   and allow processing of the message to continue.

   The choice comes down to whether the consumer considers it a threat
   when there are unknown "ptypes" present.  The semantics of the report
   are unknown; the report might be indicating the message is authentic,
   fraudulent, or that a test failed to complete.  The report itself is
   not actionable because it cannot be understood, and only its presence
   is certain.

   Generally, the advice in this situation is to ignore unknown
   "ptypes".  It is anticipated that a new property type evaluated by
   earlier handling agents would also result in the filtering of
   messages by those agents until consumers can be updated to interpret
   them.
