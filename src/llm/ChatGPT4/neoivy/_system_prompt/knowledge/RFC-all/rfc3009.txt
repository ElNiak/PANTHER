Abstract

   The RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) payload format for generic
   forward error correction allows RTP participants to improve loss
   resiliency through the use of traditional parity-based channel codes.
   This payload format requires four new MIME types, audio/parityfec,
   video/parityfec, text/parityfec and application/parityfec.  This
   document serves as the MIME type registration for those formats.

1 Introduction

   The RTP payload format for generic forward error correction [1]
   allows RTP participants to improve loss resiliency through the use of
   traditional parity-based channel codes.  This payload format requires
   four new MIME types, audio/parityfec, video/parityfec,
   text/paritfyfec and application/parityfec.  RFC 2048 [2] defines
   procedures for registration of new MIME types within the IETF tree.
   Furthermore, the Audio/Video Transport working group has defined
   additional procedures that must be followed when registering RTP
   payload formats [3].  This document serves as the MIME type
   registration for those formats based on those procedures.

2 Registration of audio/parityfec

       To: ietf-types@iana.org

       Subject: Registration of MIME media type audio/parityfec

       MIME media type name: audio

       MIME subtype name: parityfec

       Required parameters: none

            Note that [3] mandates that RTP payload formats without a
            defined rate must define a rate parameter as part of their
            MIME registration.  The payload format for generic forward
            error correction [1] does not specify a rate parameter.
            However, the rate for FEC data is equal to the rate of the
            media data it protects.

       Optional parameters: none

            Typical optional parameters [3], such as the number of
            channels, and the duration of audio per packet, do not
            apply to FEC data.  The number of channels is effectively
            the same as the media data it protects; the same is true
            for the duration of audio per packet.

       Encoding considerations: This format is only defined for
            transport within the Real Time Transport protocol (RTP)
            [4,5].  Its transport within RTP is fully specified with RFC
            2733 [1].

       Security considerations: the same security considerations
            apply to these mime registrations as to the payloads for
            for them, as detailed in RFC 2733.

       Interoperability considerations: none

       Published specification: This MIME type is described fully
            within RFC 2733 [1].

       Applications which use this media type: Audio and video
            streaming tools which seek to improve resiliency to loss by
            sending additional data with the media stream.

       Additional information: none

3 Registration of video/parityfec

       To: ietf-types@iana.org

       Subject: Registration of MIME media type video/parityfec

       MIME media type name: video

       MIME subtype name: parityfec

       Required parameters: none

            Note that [3] mandates that RTP payload formats without a
            defined rate must define a rate parameter as part of their
            MIME registration.  The payload format for generic forward
            error correction [1] does not specify a rate parameter.
            However, the rate for FEC data is equal to the rate of the
            media data it protects.

            channels, and the duration of audio per packet, do not
            apply to FEC data.  The number of channels is effectively
            the same as the media data it protects; the same is true
            for the duration of video per packet.
