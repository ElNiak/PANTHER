1.  Introduction

   The Camellia cipher suites are already specified in RFC 5932 [15]
   with SHA-256-based Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) using
   asymmetric key encryption.  This document proposes the addition of
   new cipher suites to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) [8] protocol
   to support the Camellia [4] cipher algorithm as a block cipher
   algorithm.  The proposed cipher suites include variants using the
   SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions [13] and Galois Counter
   Mode (GCM) [14].  Elliptic curve cipher suites and pre-shared key
   (PSK) [5] cipher suites are also included.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [3].

RFC 6367             Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS       September 2011


2.  Proposed Cipher Suites

2.1.  HMAC-Based Cipher Suites

   The eight cipher suites use Camellia [4] in Cipher Block Chaining
   (CBC) [4] mode with a SHA-2 family HMAC using the elliptic curve
   cryptosystem:

 CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256 = {0xC0,0x72};
 CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384 = {0xC0,0x73};
 CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = {0xC0,0x74};
 CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384  = {0xC0,0x75};
 CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xC0,0x76};

 CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x78};
 CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xC0,0x79};

2.2.  GCM-Based Cipher Suites

   The twenty cipher suites use the same asymmetric key algorithms as
   those in the previous section but use the authenticated encryption
   modes defined in TLS 1.2 [8] with Camellia in GCM [14].

CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256          = {0xC0,0x7A};
CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384          = {0xC0,0x7B};
CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {0xC0,0x7C};
CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {0xC0,0x7D};
CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256       = {0xC0,0x7E};
CipherSuite TLS_DH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {0xC0,0x7F};
CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {0xC0,0x80};
CipherSuite TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {0xC0,0x81};
CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256       = {0xC0,0x82};
CipherSuite TLS_DH_DSS_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384       = {0xC0,0x83};
CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {0xC0,0x84};
CipherSuite TLS_DH_anon_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {0xC0,0x85};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256  = {0xC0,0x86};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384  = {0xC0,0x87};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256   = {0xC0,0x88};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384   = {0xC0,0x89};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x8A};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xC0,0x8B};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256     = {0xC0,0x8C};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384     = {0xC0,0x8D};

RFC 6367             Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS       September 2011


2.3.  PSK-Based Cipher Suites

   The fourteen cipher suites describe PSK cipher suites.  The first six
   cipher suites use Camellia with GCM, and the next eight cipher suites
   use Camellia with SHA-2 family HMAC using asymmetric key encryption
   or the elliptic curve cryptosystem.

  CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256        = {0xC0,0x8D};
  CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384        = {0xC0,0x8F};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x90};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xC0,0x91};
  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x92};
  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384    = {0xC0,0x93};
  CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256        = {0xC0,0x94};
  CipherSuite TLS_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384        = {0xC0,0x95};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x96};
  CipherSuite TLS_DHE_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xC0,0x97};
  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x98};
  CipherSuite TLS_RSA_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xC0,0x99};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = {0xC0,0x9A};
  CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_PSK_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384  = {0xC0,0x9B};

3.  Cipher Suite Definitions

3.1.  Key Exchange

   The RSA, DHE_RSA, DH_RSA, DHE_DSS, DH_DSS, ECDH, DH_anon, and ECDHE
   key exchanges are performed as defined in RFC 5246 [8].

3.2.  Cipher

   This document describes cipher suites based on Camellia cipher using
   CBC mode and GCM.  The details are as follows.

   The CAMELLIA_128_CBC cipher suites use Camellia [4] in CBC mode with
   a 128-bit key and 128-bit Initialization Vector (IV); the
   CAMELLIA_256_CBC cipher suites use a 256-bit key and 128-bit IV.

   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [19] authenticated encryption with
   additional data algorithms, AEAD_AES_128_GCM and AEAD_AES_256_GCM,
   are described in RFC 5116 [7].  AES GCM cipher suites for TLS are
   described in RFC 5288 [9].  AES and Camellia share common
   characteristics including key sizes and block length.
   CAMELLIA_128_GCM and CAMELLIA_256_GCM are defined according to those
   of AES.

RFC 6367             Camellia Cipher Suites for TLS       September 2011


3.3.  PRFs

   The hash algorithms and pseudorandom function (PRF) algorithms for
   TLS 1.2 [8] SHALL be as follows:

   a.  The cipher suites ending with _SHA256 use HMAC-SHA-256 [1] as the
       MAC algorithm.  The PRF is the TLS PRF [8] with SHA-256 [13] as
       the hash function.

   b.  The cipher suites ending with _SHA384 use HMAC-SHA-384 [1] as the
       MAC algorithm.  The PRF is the TLS PRF [8] with SHA-384 [13] as
       the hash function.

   When used with TLS versions prior to 1.2 (TLS 1.0 [2] and TLS 1.1
   [6]), the PRF is calculated as specified in the appropriate version
   of the TLS specification.

3.4.  PSK Cipher Suites

   PSK cipher suites for TLS are described in RFC 5487 [11] as to SHA-
   256/384 and RFC 5489 [12] as to ECDHE_PSK.

4.  Security Considerations

   At the time of writing this document, there are no known weak keys
   for Camellia.  Additionally, no security problems with Camellia have
   been found (see NESSIE [16], CRYPTREC [17], and LNCS 5867[18]).

   The security considerations in previous RFCs (RFC 5116 [7], RFC 5289
   [10], and RFC 5487 [11]) apply to this document as well.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA allocated the following numbers in the TLS Cipher Suite
   Registry:

CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256  = {0xC0,0x72};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384  = {0xC0,0x73};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256   = {0xC0,0x74};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384   = {0xC0,0x75};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256    = {0xC0,0x76};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384    = {0xC0,0x77};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_CBC_SHA256     = {0xC0,0x78};
CipherSuite TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA384     = {0xC0,0x79};
CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256          = {0xC0,0x7A};
CipherSuite TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384          = {0xC0,0x7B};
CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_128_GCM_SHA256      = {0xC0,0x7C};
CipherSuite TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_GCM_SHA384      = {0xC0,0x7D};
