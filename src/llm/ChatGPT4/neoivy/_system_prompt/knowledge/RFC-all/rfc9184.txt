                BGP Extended Community Registries Update

Abstract

   This document updates several BGP Extended Community registries in
   order to replace the "Experimental Use" registration procedure in
   some entries, since their use is clearly not experimental and is thus
   misleading.

   This document updates RFCs 7153 and 8955.

1.  Introduction

   The IANA registries for the type values and sub-type values of the
   BGP Extended Communities attribute were reorganized by [RFC7153].  As
   a result, IANA maintains a registry entitled "BGP Transitive Extended
   Community Types", which includes a range of type values (0x80-0x8F)
   reserved for Experimental Use [RFC8126].  Out of this experimental
   range, types 0x80, 0x81, and 0x82 have been used in [RFC5575] and
   [RFC7674] (both documents were rendered obsolete by [RFC8955]).  The
   primary use for those types and the sub-type registries is non-
   experimental.

   Section 2 describes updates to the registry to reflect the actual use
   of those code points by changing the registration procedure from
   "Experimental Use" to "First Come First Served" [RFC8126] for the
   types 0x80-0x82 (and removing "Experimental Use" from the sub-type
   registry names), thereby updating [RFC7153] and [RFC8955].

2.  IANA Considerations

2.1.  Registry: BGP Transitive Extended Community Types

   IANA maintains a registry entitled "BGP Transitive Extended Community
   Types".  IANA has added RFC 9184 to the reference of this registry.
   They have also updated the name of the type values according to
   Table 1 and added RFC 9184 as a reference for the existing entries.

   +=======+==============================================+===========+
   | Type  | Name                                         | Reference |
   | Value |                                              |           |
   +=======+==============================================+===========+
   | 0x80  | Generic Transitive Extended Community (Sub-  | RFC 9184  |
   |       | Types are defined in the "Generic Transitive |           |
   |       | Extended Community Sub-Types" registry)      |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0x81  | Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 2 | RFC 9184  |
   |       | (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic       |           |
   |       | Transitive Extended Community Part 2 Sub-    |           |
   |       | Types" registry)                             |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0x82  | Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 3 | RFC 9184  |
   |       | (Sub-Types are defined in the "Generic       |           |
   |       | Transitive Extended Community Part 3 Sub-    |           |
   |       | Types" registry)                             |           |
   +-------+----------------------------------------------+-----------+

        Table 1: Registry: BGP Transitive Extended Community Types

   Furthermore, IANA has changed the registration procedures of this
   registry for type values 0x80 through 0x82 to First Come First Served
   [RFC8126].  The resulting registration procedures should read as in
   Table 2.

       +===========+===============================================+
       | Range     | Registration Procedures                       |
       +===========+===============================================+
       | 0x00-0x3f | First Come First Served                       |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x80-0x82 | First Come First Served (see RFC 9184)        |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x83-0x8f | Reserved for Experimental Use (see [RFC3692]) |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
       | 0x90-0xbf | Standards Action                              |
       +-----------+-----------------------------------------------+

                              Community Types

2.2.  Registry: Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community
      Sub-Types

   IANA maintains a registry entitled "Generic Transitive Experimental
   Use Extended Community Sub-Types".  IANA has added RFC 9184 to the
   reference of this registry and updated the registry title to:

      "Generic Transitive Extended Community Sub-Types"

2.3.  Registry: Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community
      Part 2 Sub-Types

   IANA maintains a registry entitled "Generic Transitive Experimental
   Use Extended Community Part 2 Sub-Types".  IANA has added RFC 9184 to
   the reference of this registry and updated the registry title to:

      "Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 2 Sub-Types"

2.4.  Registry: Generic Transitive Experimental Use Extended Community
      Part 3 Sub-Types

   IANA maintains a registry entitled "Generic Transitive Experimental
   Use Extended Community Part 3 Sub-Types".  IANA has added RFC 9184 to
   the reference of this registry and updated the registry title to:

      "Generic Transitive Extended Community Part 3 Sub-Types"
