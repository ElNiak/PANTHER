Abstract

   This document registers a set of IANA Diameter Command Codes to be
   used in new vendor-specific Diameter applications defined for the
   Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Packet System
   (EPS).  These new Diameter applications are defined for Mobile
   Management Entity (MME)- and Serving GPRS (General Packet Radio
   Service) Support Node (SGSN)-related interfaces in in the
   architecture for the Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain, which is
   also known as the Evolved Packet System (EPS).

1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is defining the
   Evolved 3GPP Packet Switched Domain - also known as the Evolved
   Packet System (EPS).  As part of this architecture, the interfaces
   based on the Diameter protocol [RFC3588] require the definition of
   two new Diameter applications.

   As defined in [TS29.272], the 3GPP S6a/S6d application (vendor-
   specific application id: 16777251) enables the transfer of
   subscriber-related data between the Mobile Management Entity (MME)
   and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) on the S6a interface and between
   the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Home Subscriber Server
   (HSS) on the S6d interface.

   Also defined in [TS29.272], the 3GPP S13/S13' application (vendor-
   specific application id: 16777252) enables the Mobile Equipment
   Identity check procedure between the Mobile Management Entity (MME)
   and the Equipment Identity Register (EIR) on the S13 interface and
   between the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and the Equipment
   Identity Register (EIR) on the S13' interface.

   Both Diameter applications are defined under the 3GPP vendor-id
   "10415".  This document defines the assigned values of the command
   codes used in these applications.

2.  Terminology

   The base Diameter specification (Section 1.3 of [RFC3588]) defines
   most of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the
   terms and acronyms defined in [TS29.272] are used in this document.

3.  Command Codes

   The 3GPP S6a/S6d application described in Section 5 of [TS29.272]
   requires the allocation of command code values for the following
   command pairs:

   o  3GPP-Update-Location-Request/Answer (ULR/ULA)

   o  3GPP-Cancel-Location-Request/Answer (CLR/CLA)

   o  3GPP-Authentication-Information-Request/ Answer (AIR/AIA)

   o  3GPP-Insert-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (IDR/IDA)

   o  3GPP-Delete-Subscriber-Data-Request/Answer (DSR/DSA)

   o  3GPP-Purge-UE-Request/Answer (PUR/PUA)

   o  3GPP-Reset-Request/Answer (RSR/RSA)

   o  3GPP-Notify-Request/Answer (NOR/NOA)

   The 3GPP S13/S13 application described in Section 6 of [TS29.272]
   requires the allocation of a command code value for the following
   command pair:

   o  3GPP-ME-Identity-Check-Request/Answer (ECR/ECA)

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC5226].

   This document defines values in the namespace that has been defined
   in the Diameter base specification [RFC3588].  Section 11 of
   [RFC3588] (that document's IANA Considerations) details the
   assignment criteria.  IANA allocated the following command code
   values:

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes command codes used in applications that build
   on top of the Diameter base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security
   mechanisms offered by [RFC3588].

6.  Acknowledgements
