RFC 3872                      MIB for TRIP                September 2004


1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB module objects are
   generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP).  Objects in this MIB module are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579],
   and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

2.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that are used
   to schedule management operations periodically or at specified dates
   and times.  Since TRIP [RFC3219] is modeled after the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP-4) [RFC1771], the managed objects for TRIP are also
   modeled after RFC1657 - Definitions of Managed Objects for the
   Fourth Version of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) using SMIv2
   [RFC1657].

3.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   This MIB module provides managed objects for TRIP devices defined in
   Telephony Routing over IP [RFC3219].  TRIP is an inter-domain
   application-layer control protocol that exchanges information
   between TRIP location servers (LS) to provide efficient IP telephony
   routing.

5.  Structure of TRIP MIB

   This MIB module utilizes the framework described in RFC 2788
   [RFC2788] for management of multiple instances of TRIP from a single
   entity.  The Network Services Monitoring MIB module applTable will
   be populated with entries corresponding to each TRIP Location Server



Zinman, et al.              Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 3872                      MIB for TRIP                September 2004


   in the system.  Each TRIP Location Server will then have an
   applIndex associated with it.  The value assigned to applIndex will
   represent the distinct instance of TRIP.

   The TRIP MIB module contains the following groups of objects with
   each group as part of the management of a singular TRIP entity.  Each
   group covers a section of functionality of TRIP:

   o  The tripConfigGroup contains the common configuration objects
      applicable to all TRIP applications referenced by the applIndex.

   o  The tripPeerTableConfigGroup contains the configuration objects
      applicable to all TRIP peers of the Location Server referenced by
      the applIndex.

   o  The tripRouteGroup contains the configuration objects related to
      the routes of all TRIBs of this Location Server.

   o  The tripItadTopologyGroup contains information about the topology
      of the TRIP ITADs concerning this Location Server.

   o  The tripPeerTableStatsGroup contains the statistical objects
      applicable to all TRIP peers of the Location Server referenced by
      the applIndex.

   o  The tripNotificationGroup contains notifications that the TRIP
      application can generate.

   o  The tripNotifObjectGroup contains the objects needed by one or
      more of the notifications.

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The data types TripItad and TripId are used as textual conventions
   in this document.  A TRIP ITAD (IP Telephony Administrative Domain)
   is described in [RFC3219].  A TRIP ID is used as a distinct
   identifier for a TRIP Location Server.  A TripAppProtocol is used to
   identify an application protocol.  A TripAddressFamily is used to
   define an address family.  TripCommunityId is used as a distinct
   identifier for a TRIP community.  TripProtocolVersion depicts the
   version number of the TRIP protocol.  TripSendReceiveMode describes
   the operational mode of the TRIP application.

7.  Security Considerations

   The managed objects in this MIB module contain sensitive information
   since, collectively, they allow tracing and influencing of
   connections in TRIP devices and provide information of their
   connection characteristics.  As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB module MAY result in denial of
   service to a large number of available routes.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects MAY be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects include:





Zinman, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 48]

RFC 3872                      MIB for TRIP                September 2004


      tripCfgItad:
      Improper setting of tripCfgItad value can make all peer
      connections drop and not be re-established.

      tripCfgAdminStatus:
      Improper setting of tripCfgAdminStatus from up to down will cause
      the TRIP Location Server stop processing TRIP messages.

      tripCfgPort:
      Improper setting of tripCfgPort can cause the failure of a peer
      establishing a connection.

      tripCfgMinItadOriginationInterval,
      tripCfgMinRouteAdvertisementInterval:
      Improper configuration of these values MAY adversely affect local
      and global convergence of the routes advertised by this TRIP
      Location Server.

      tripPeerAdminStatus:
      Improper setting of tripPeerAdminStatus from up to down can cause
      significant disruption of the connectivity to the destination via
      the applicable remote TRIP Location Server peer.

      tripPeerConnectRetryInterval,tripPeerMaxRetryInterval:
      Improper configuration of these values can cause connections to be
      disrupted for extremely long time periods when otherwise they
      would be restored in a relatively short period of time.

      tripPeerHoldTimeConfigured, tripPeerKeepAliveConfigured:
      Improper configuration of these value can make TRIP peer sessions
      more fragile and less resilient to denial of service attacks.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB module that contain
   sensitive information regarding the operation of a network.  For
   example, a TRIP Location Server peer's local and remote addresses
   might be sensitive for ISPs who want to keep interface addresses on
   TRIP Location Server confidential so as to prevent TRIP Location
   Server addresses used for a denial of service attack or address
   spoofing.

   Therefore, it is thus important to control even GET access to these
   objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP
   provide features for such a secure environment.







Zinman, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 49]

RFC 3872                      MIB for TRIP                September 2004


   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
