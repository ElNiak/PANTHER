                 Diameter Policy Processing Application

Status of This Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does

Abstract

   This document describes the need for a new IANA Diameter Command Code
   to be used in a vendor-specific new application for invocation of
   Policy Processing (Policy Evaluation, or Evaluation and Enforcement).
   This application is needed as one of the implementations of the Open
   Mobile Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation, Enforcement and Management
   (PEEM) enabler, namely for the PEM-1 interface used to send a
   request/response for Policy Processing.

RFC 5224                          PEEM                        March 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document summarizes the use of Diameter codes in a newly defined
   realization of a specification for invocation of policy processing.
   A new Command Code has been assigned by IANA.  The document
   summarizes the uses of newly defined Diameter codes (a Command Code,
   an AVP, and a vendor-specific application id).  When combined with
   the Diameter Base protocol, this application's specification
   satisfies the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Policy Evaluation,
   Enforcement, and Management (PEEM) requirements for sending a request
   for policy processing and receiving a response with the policy
   processing result.  See [PEM-1-TS] for the normative use of Diameter.
   PEEM requirements are documented in [PEEM-RD] and PEEM Architecture
   is documented in [PEEM-AD].

   The Diameter realization of this application assumes the use of the
   Diameter Base protocol, as per RFC 3588, and extends it only for a
   specific application using a vendor-id (PEN), a vendor-specific
   application ID, a new Command Code (314), and a new AVP defined in
   the vendor-specific namespace.  Input to policy processing are being
   passed through a new AVP, and policy results are being passed through
   a combination of the same new AVP, and the Experimental-Result AVP.

2.  Terminology

   The base Diameter specification (Section 1.4 of [RFC3588]) defines
   most of the terminology used in this document.  Additionally, the
   terms and acronyms defined in [PEM-1-TS] are used in this document.


3.  Diameter Policy Processing Application

   A detailed description of the Diameter Policy Processing Application
   can be found in Section 5.4.1 of the Policy Evaluation, Enforcement
   and Management Callable Interface (PEM-1) Technical Specification
   [PEM-1-TS].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the Diameter Policy Processing Application.
   It builds on top of the Diameter Base protocol and the same security
   considerations described in RFC 3588 [RFC3588] are applicable to this
   document.  No further extensions are required beyond the security
   mechanisms offered by RFC 3588.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the Internet Assigned Numbers
   Authority (IANA) regarding registration of values related to the
   Diameter protocol, in accordance with BCP 26 [RFC2434].

   This document defines values in the namespaces that have been created
   and defined in the Diameter Base [RFC3588].  The IANA Considerations
   section of that document details the assignment criteria.  Values
   assigned in this document, or by future IANA action, must be
   coordinated within this shared namespace.

5.1.  Command Codes

   This specification assigns the value 314 from the Command Code
   namespace defined in [RFC3588].  See Section 5.4.1.3.1 of [PEM-1-TS]
   to see how the command code is used.

   IANA has made the following assignment in the "Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Parameters" registry, in the sub-
   registry "Command Codes".

   Code Value          Name                            Reference
   --------------      ------------------------------- ---------
   314                 PDR / PDA                       [RFC5224]

5.2.  AVP Codes

   This specification uses the value 1 for the Policy-Data AVP, in the
   OMA Vendor-ID (PEN) AVP namespace.  See Section 5.4.1.3.3 of
   [PEM-1-TS] for the assignment of the namespace in this specification.

5.3.  Application Identifier

   This specification uses the value 16777243 in the Application
   Identifier namespace as registered in IANA for the Policy Processing
   Application.  See Section 5.4.1.3 of [PEM-1-TS] for more information.

   The author would like to thank Dan Romascanu and Hannes Tschofenig
   for their help and support.

   Finally, the author would like to thank Alcatel-Lucent, as most of
   the effort put into this document was done while he was in their
   employ.
