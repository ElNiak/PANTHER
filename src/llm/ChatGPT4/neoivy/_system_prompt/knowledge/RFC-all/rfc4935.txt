RFC 4935            Fabric Configuration Server MIB          August 2007


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to a Fibre Channel network's Fabric Configuration Server function,
   which provides a means by which a management application can discover
   Fibre Channel fabric topology and attributes.  Discovered topology
   includes Interconnect Elements (i.e., switches, hubs, bridges, etc.)
   and their ports, as well as "platforms" that consist of one or more
   Fibre Channel nodes.

   This memo was previously approved by INternational Committee for
   Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Task Group T11.5
   (http://www.t11.org); this document is a product of the IETF's IMSS
   working group.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a



DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 4935            Fabric Configuration Server MIB          August 2007


   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel "node" consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an "Arbitrated Loop" topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes' ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an
   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally unique names.  These globally unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers that identify
   the frame's source and destination ports.  Each FC port has both an
   address identifier and a WWN.  When a Fabric is in use, the FC
   address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.  Each
   octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address hierarchy,
   with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration Server provides a way for a
   management application to discover Fibre Channel fabric topology and
   attributes.  The Fabric Configuration Server is designed so that it
   can be distributed among switches and accessed from any Nx_Port.
   However, the Fabric Configuration Server is not restricted or
   required to be part of/within a Fabric.

   The information registered with and available from each Fabric
   Configuration Server is modeled as a Fabric consisting of one or more
   Interconnect Elements that each have some number of physical Ports,
   and one or more Fibre Channel nodes grouped together into Platforms
   to facilitate discovery and management.  The Ports are connected
   either to other Ports on other Interconnect Elements, or to Nx_Ports.
   Each Interconnect Element may have attributes including its name,
   type, Domain Identifier, Management Identifier, Logical Name,
   Management Address(es), Information List, Zoning Enforcement Status,
   etc.  Each Port may have attributes including its name, type, TX
   type, Module type, physical port number, attached port name(s), port
   state, speed, etc.  Each platform may have attributes including its
   name, type, description, label, location, management address, etc.

RFC 4935            Fabric Configuration Server MIB          August 2007


   The Fibre Channel Fabric Configuration Server is defined in the FC-GS
   specification.  The Fabric Configuration Server is one of a set of
   functions that are collectively known as the Management Service.  The
   latest version of the specification is [FC-GS-5].

   The latest standard for an interconnecting Fabric containing multiple
   Fabric Switch elements is [FC-SW-4].  [FC-SW-4] carries forward the
   earlier specification for the operation of a single Fabric in a
   physical infrastructure, and augments it with the definition of
   Virtual Fabrics and with the specification of how multiple Virtual
   Fabrics can operate within one (or more) physical infrastructures.
   The use of Virtual Fabrics provides for each frame to be tagged in
   its header to indicate which one of several Virtual Fabrics that
   frame is being transmitted on.  All frames entering a particular
   "Core Switch" [FC-SW-4] (i.e., a physical switch) on the same Virtual
   Fabric are processed by the same "Virtual Switch" within that Core
   Switch.

4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on
   Fibre Channel switches.  It has been replaced by the more generic
   Fibre Channel Management MIB [RFC4044], which defines basic
   information for Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including
   extensions to the standard IF-MIB for Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [RFC4044] to cover the functionality, in
   Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel's Fabric
   Configuration Server function.

   This MIB imports some common Textual Conventions from T11-TC-MIB
   [RFC4439] and from T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB [RFC4438].  It also imports
   URLString from NETWORK-SERVICES-MIB [RFC2788].

5.  MIB Overview

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of,
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more Fabric Configuration
   Servers (FCS) in a Fibre Channel (FC) network.  The capabilities
   provided include triggering a discovery of the configuration of one
   or more Fabrics, retrieving the results of such a discovery, as well
   as controlling and monitoring the operation of an FCS.  The
   discovered configuration contains information about:

   - Interconnect Elements (IEs), i.e., switches, hubs, bridges, etc.,
   - Ports on IEs, and
   - Platforms that consist of one or more FC nodes.

RFC 4935            Fabric Configuration Server MIB          August 2007


5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [RFC4044] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [RFC4044] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance, for example, within the same SNMP context
   ([RFC3411], section 3.3.1).

5.2.  Switch Index

   The FC-MGMT-MIB [RFC4044] defines the fcmSwitchTable as a table of
   information about Fibre Channel switches that are managed by Fibre
   Channel management instances.  Each Fibre Channel management instance
   can manage one or more Fibre Channel switches.  The Switch Index,
   fcmSwitchIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB as the index value
   to uniquely identify a Fibre Channel switch amongst those (one or
   more) managed by the same Fibre Channel management instance.

5.3.  Fabric Index

   With multiple Fabrics, each Fabric has its own instances of the
   Fabric-related management instrumentation.  Thus, this MIB defines
   all Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an
   arbitrary integer, named a "Fabric Index".  The syntax of a Fabric
   Index is T11FabricIndex, imported from T11-TC-MIB [RFC4439].  When a
   device is connected to a single physical Fabric, without use of any
   virtual Fabrics, the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.  In
   an environment of multiple virtual and/or physical Fabrics, this
   index provides a means to distinguish one Fabric from another.

   It is quite possible, and may even be likely, that a Fibre Channel
   switch will have ports connected to multiple virtual and/or physical
   Fabrics.  Thus, in order to simplify a management protocol query
   concerning all the Fabrics to which a single switch is connected,
   fcmSwitchIndex will be listed before t11FcsFabricIndex when they both
   appear in the same INDEX clause.

5.4.  The MIB Groups

   This section describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB
   module.

5.4.1.  The t11FcsDiscoveredConfigGroup Group

   This group contains the Fabric configuration information discovered
   by Fabric Configuration Servers.

5.4.2.  The t11FcsDiscoveryStatusGroup Group

   This group contains objects by which to monitor the status of
   discovery of Fabric configurations by Fabric Configuration Servers.

5.4.3.  The t11FcsDiscoveryControlGroup Group

   This group contains objects for requesting a Fabric Configuration
   Server to discover the configuration of one or more Fabrics.

5.4.4.  The t11FcsStatisticsGroup Group

   This group contains objects for Fabric Configuration Server
   statistics information.

5.4.5.  The t11FcsNotificationGroup Group

   This group contains three notifications, generated when an FCS:

   - rejects a registration, deregistration, or query request;
   - completes discovery on a range of Fabrics;
   - learns that a management address of an Interconnect Element has
     changed.

5.4.5.1. Flow Control for Notifications

   When defining SNMP notifications for events that occur in the data-
   plane, the maximum frequency of their generation needs to be
   considered.  Unless there is some limiting factor, such notifications
   need to be flow-controlled in some way, e.g., defined such that after
   some maximum number within a specified time interval have occurred,
   further notifications are suppressed for some subsequent time
   interval.  However, as and when such a suppression occurs, the
   Network Management System (NMS) that didn't receive the notifications
   (because they were suppressed) needs to be able to obtain an
   indication of how many were suppressed.  Therefore, an additional
   Counter32 object needs to be defined, and/or a new type of
   notification needs to be defined for use at the end of the interval.



DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 4935            Fabric Configuration Server MIB          August 2007


   While this is extra complexity, it is necessary for notifications
   that need to be flow-controlled.

   In contrast, for notifications such as all the ones defined in this
   MIB module, which are generated due to control-plane events (and are
   not able to start a chain reaction):

   - estimating the maximum number that could possibly be generated per
     unit time for each type of notification is too simplistic.  For
     example, it's unreasonable to ask how many of the
     t11FcsDiscoveryCompleteNotify notifications can be generated in a
     time interval, because it depends on several factors: how big is
     the network? how many Virtual Fabrics need to be discovered? how
     quickly can the operator ask for another discovery after the last
     one completes?

   - the extra complexity of flow-controlling these types of
     notifications is not warranted.

5.4.6.  The t11FcsNotificationInfoGroup Group

   This group contains notification control and notification information
   objects for monitoring Fabric Configuration Server request rejection
   and discovery of topology information.

5.5.  OS Logical Unit Number (LUN) Map Entries

   A "Platform" is defined in FC-GS-5 to be not only a set of zero or
   more FC nodes, but also a set of zero or more "OS LUN Map Entries"
   (see Figure 8 in [FC-GS-5]).  Information on "OS LUN Map Entries" is
   not included in this T11-FC-FABRIC-CONFIG-SERVER-MIB.  Instead,
   information on LUN Maps can be obtained via the scsiLunMapGroup
   object group defined in the SCSI-MIB [RFC4455].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a MIB OID (162) under the mib-2 subtree.

8.  Security Considerations

   There are several management objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability is:

      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeLow
      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryRangeHigh
      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryTimeOut
      t11FcsFabricDiscoveryStart -- the ability to specify parameters
                                    for, and trigger the start of,
                                    a topology discovery.
      t11FcsDiscoveryStatus      -- the ability to abort a discovery, or
                                    invalidate discovered information.
      t11FcsReqRejectNotifyEnable
      t11FcsDiscoveryCompNotifyEnable
      t11FcsMgmtAddrChangeNotifyEnable -- the ability to enable/disable
                                          notifications.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  For example, the ability to invalidate
   discovered topology may afford an attacker the ability to hide the
   presence of unauthorized equipment on the network.  The support for
   SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      t11FcsIeTable
      t11FcsMgmtAddrListTable
      t11FcsPortTable
      t11FcsAttachPortNameListTable
      t11FcsPlatformTable




DeSanti, et al.             Standards Track                    [Page 45]

RFC 4935            Fabric Configuration Server MIB          August 2007


      t11FcsNodeNameListTable -- contains information about the topology
                                 of the Fibre Channel network.

      t11FcsStatsTable -- contains statistics information about the
                          operation of the Fabric Configuration Server.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
