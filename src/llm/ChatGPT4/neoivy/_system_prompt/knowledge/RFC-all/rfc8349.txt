        A YANG Data Model for Routing Management (NMDA Version)

Abstract

   This document specifies three YANG modules and one submodule.
   Together, they form the core routing data model that serves as a
   framework for configuring and managing a routing subsystem.  It is
   expected that these modules will be augmented by additional YANG
   modules defining data models for control-plane protocols, route
   filters, and other functions.  The core routing data model provides
   common building blocks for such extensions -- routes, Routing
   Information Bases (RIBs), and control-plane protocols.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA).  This document obsoletes RFC 8022.

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the following YANG modules:

   o  The "ietf-routing" module provides generic components of a routing
      data model.

   o  The "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" module augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv4 unicast.

   o  The "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module augments the "ietf-routing"
      module with additional data specific to IPv6 unicast.  Its
      submodule, "ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements", also augments the
      "ietf-interfaces"  [RFC8343] and "ietf-ip" [RFC8344] modules with
      IPv6 router configuration variables required by [RFC4861].

   These modules together define the core routing data model, which is
   intended as a basis for future data model development covering
   more-sophisticated routing systems.  While these three modules can be
   directly used for simple IP devices with static routing (see
   Appendix B), their main purpose is to provide essential building
   blocks for more-complicated data models involving multiple
   control-plane protocols, multicast routing, additional address
   families, and advanced functions such as route filtering or policy
   routing.  To this end, it is expected that the core routing data
   model will be augmented by numerous modules developed by various IETF
   working groups.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  This document obsoletes
   RFC 8022 [RFC8022].

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342]:

   o  client

   o  server

   system-controlled entry:  An entry in a list in the operational state
      ("config false") that is created by the system independently of
      what has been explicitly configured.  See Section 4.1 for details.

   user-controlled entry:  An entry in a list in the operational state
      ("config false") that is created and deleted as a direct
      consequence of certain configuration changes.  See Section 4.1 for
      details.

2.2.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

            +--------+---------------------------+-----------+
            | Prefix | YANG module               | Reference |
            +--------+---------------------------+-----------+

3.  Objectives

   The initial design of the core routing data model was driven by the
   following objectives:

   o  The data model should be suitable for the common address families
      -- in particular, IPv4 and IPv6 -- and for unicast and multicast
      routing, as well as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS).

   o  A simple IP routing system, such as one that uses only static
      routing, should be configurable in a simple way, ideally without
      any need to develop additional YANG modules.



Lhotka, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


   o  On the other hand, the core routing framework must allow for
      complicated implementations involving multiple RIBs and multiple
      control-plane protocols, as well as controlled redistributions of
      routing information.

   o  Because device vendors will want to map the data models built on
      this generic framework to their proprietary data models and
      configuration interfaces, the framework should be flexible enough
      to facilitate such mapping and accommodate data models with
      different logic.

4.  The Design of the Core Routing Data Model

   The core routing data model consists of three YANG modules and one
   submodule.  The first module, "ietf-routing", defines the generic
   components of a routing system.  The other two modules --
   "ietf-ipv4-unicast-routing" and "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" --
   augment the "ietf-routing" module with additional data nodes that are
   needed for IPv4 and IPv6 unicast routing, respectively.  The
   "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module has a submodule,
   "ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements", that augments the
   "ietf-interfaces" [RFC8343] and "ietf-ip" [RFC8344] modules with
   configuration variables for IPv6 Router Advertisements as required by
   [RFC4861].

                         Figure 1: Data Hierarchy

   As can be seen from Figure 1, the core routing data model introduces
   several generic components of a routing framework: routes, RIBs
   containing lists of routes, and control-plane protocols.  Section 5
   describes these components in more detail.

4.1.  System-Controlled and User-Controlled List Entries

   The core routing data model defines several lists in the schema tree,
   such as "rib", that have to be populated with at least one entry in
   any properly functioning device, and additional entries may be
   configured by a client.





Lhotka, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 8]

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


   In such a list, the server creates the required item as a
   "system-controlled entry" in the operational state, i.e., inside
   read-only lists in the "routing" container.

   An example can be seen in Appendix D: the "/routing/ribs/rib" list
   has two system-controlled entries -- "ipv4-master" and "ipv6-master".

   Additional entries called "user-controlled entries" may be created in
   the configuration by a client, e.g., via the Network Configuration
   Protocol (NETCONF).  If the server accepts a configured
   user-controlled entry, then this entry also appears in the
   operational state version of the list.

   Corresponding entries in both versions of the list (in the intended
   configuration and the operational state) [RFC8342] have the same
   value of the list key.

   A client may also provide supplemental configuration of system-
   controlled entries.  To do so, the client creates a new entry in the
   configuration with the desired contents.  In order to bind this entry
   to the corresponding entry in the operational state, the key of the
   configuration entry has to be set to the same value as the key of the
   operational state entry.

   Deleting a user-controlled entry from the intended configuration
   results in the removal of the corresponding entry in the operational
   state list.  In contrast, if a client deletes a system-controlled
   entry from the intended configuration, only the extra configuration
   specified in that entry is removed; the corresponding operational
   state entry is not removed.

5.  Basic Building Blocks

   This section describes the essential components of the core routing
   data model.

5.1.  Routes

   Routes are basic elements of information in a routing system.  The
   core routing data model defines only the following minimal set of
   route attributes:

   o  "destination-prefix": address prefix specifying the set of
      destination addresses for which the route may be used.  This
      attribute is mandatory.






Lhotka, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 9]

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


   o  "route-preference": an integer value (also known as
      "administrative distance") that is used for selecting a preferred
      route among routes with the same destination prefix.  A lower
      value indicates a route that is more preferred.

   o  "next-hop": determines the outgoing interface and/or next-hop
      address(es), or a special operation to be performed on a packet.

   Routes are primarily system state and appear as entries in RIBs
   (Section 5.2), but they may also be found in configuration data --
   for example, as manually configured static routes.  In the latter
   case, configurable route attributes are generally a subset of
   attributes defined for RIB routes.

5.2.  Routing Information Base (RIB)

   Every implementation of the core routing data model manages one or
   more RIBs.  A RIB is a list of routes complemented with
   administrative data.  Each RIB contains only routes of one address
   family.  An address family is represented by an identity derived from
   the "rt:address-family" base identity.

   In the core routing data model, RIBs are represented as entries in
   the list "/routing/ribs/rib" in the operational state.  The contents
   of RIBs are controlled and manipulated by control-plane protocol
   operations that may result in route additions, removals, and
   modifications.  This also includes manipulations via the "static"
   and/or "direct" pseudo-protocols; see Section 5.3.1.

   For every supported address family, exactly one RIB MUST be marked as
   the "default RIB", in which control-plane protocols place their
   routes by default.

   Simple router implementations that do not advertise the
   "multiple-ribs" feature will typically create one system-controlled
   RIB per supported address family and mark it as the default RIB.

   More-complex router implementations advertising the "multiple-ribs"
   feature support multiple RIBs per address family that can be used for
   policy routing and other purposes.

   The following action (see Section 7.15 of [RFC7950]) is defined for
   the "rib" list:

   o  active-route -- return the active RIB route for the destination
      address that is specified as the action's input parameter.

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


5.3.  Control-Plane Protocol

   The core routing data model provides an open-ended framework for
   defining multiple control-plane protocol instances, e.g., for Layer 3
   routing protocols.  Each control-plane protocol instance MUST be
   assigned a type, which is an identity derived from the
   "rt:control-plane-protocol" base identity.  The core routing data
   model defines two identities for the "direct" and "static"
   pseudo-protocols (Section 5.3.1).

   Multiple control-plane protocol instances of the same type MAY be
   configured.

5.3.1.  Routing Pseudo-Protocols

   The core routing data model defines two special routing protocol
   types -- "direct" and "static".  Both are in fact pseudo-protocols,
   which means that they are confined to the local device and do not
   exchange any routing information with adjacent routers.

   Every implementation of the core routing data model MUST provide
   exactly one instance of the "direct" pseudo-protocol type.  It is the
   source of direct routes for all configured address families.  Direct
   routes are normally supplied by the operating system kernel, based on
   the configuration of network interface addresses; see Section 6.2.

   A pseudo-protocol of the type "static" allows for specifying routes
   manually.  It MAY be configured in zero or multiple instances,
   although a typical configuration will have exactly one instance.

5.3.2.  Defining New Control-Plane Protocols

   It is expected that future YANG modules will create data models for
   additional control-plane protocol types.  Such new modules will have
   to define the protocol-specific data nodes, and they will have to
   integrate into the core routing framework in the following way:

   o  A new identity MUST be defined for the control-plane protocol, and
      its base identity MUST be set to "rt:control-plane-protocol" or to
      an identity derived from "rt:control-plane-protocol".











Lhotka, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 11]

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


   o  Additional route attributes MAY be defined, preferably in one
      place by means of defining a YANG grouping.  The new attributes
      have to be inserted by augmenting the definitions of the node

       /rt:routing/rt:ribs/rt:rib/rt:routes/rt:route

      and possibly other places in the schema tree.

   o  Data nodes for the new protocol can be defined by augmenting the
      "control-plane-protocol" data node under "/routing".

   By using a "when" statement, the augmented data nodes specific to the
   new protocol SHOULD be made conditional and valid only if the value
   of "rt:type" or "rt:source-protocol" is equal to (or derived from)
   the new protocol's identity.

   It is also RECOMMENDED that protocol-specific data nodes be
   encapsulated in an appropriately named container with presence.  Such
   a container may contain mandatory data nodes that are otherwise
   forbidden at the top level of an augment.

   The above steps are implemented by the example YANG module for the
   Routing Information Protocol (RIP); see Appendix C.

5.4.  Parameters of IPv6 Router Advertisements

   The YANG module "ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements" (Section 9.1),
   which is a submodule of the "ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing" module,
   augments the schema tree of IPv6 interfaces with definitions of the
   following variables as required by Section 6.2.1 of [RFC4861]:

   o  default-lifetime

   o  prefix-list: a list of prefixes to be advertised.

      The following parameters are associated with each prefix in
      the list:

      *  valid-lifetime

      *  on-link-flag

      *  preferred-lifetime

      *  autonomous-flag

   NOTES:

   1.  The "IsRouter" flag, which is also required by [RFC4861], is
       implemented in the "ietf-ip" module [RFC8344] (leaf
       "ip:forwarding").

   2.  The Neighbor Discovery specification [RFC4861] allows the
       implementations to decide whether the "valid-lifetime" and
       "preferred-lifetime" parameters remain the same in consecutive
       advertisements or decrement in real time.  However, the latter
       behavior seems problematic because the values might be reset
       again to the (higher) configured values after a configuration is
       reloaded.  Moreover, no implementation is known to use the
       decrementing behavior.  The "ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements"
       submodule therefore stipulates the former behavior with constant
       values.

6.  Interactions with Other YANG Modules

   The semantics of the core routing data model also depends on several
   configuration parameters that are defined in other YANG modules.

6.1.  Module "ietf-interfaces"

   The following boolean switch is defined in the "ietf-interfaces" YANG
   module [RFC8343]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network-layer interface,
      then all routing and forwarding functions MUST be disabled on this
      interface.

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


6.2.  Module "ietf-ip"

   The following boolean switches are defined in the "ietf-ip" YANG
   module [RFC8344]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network-layer interface,
      then all IPv4 routing and forwarding functions MUST be disabled on
      this interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network-layer interface,
      then the forwarding of IPv4 datagrams through this interface MUST
      be disabled.  However, the interface MAY participate in other IPv4
      routing functions, such as routing protocols.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:enabled

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network-layer interface,
      then all IPv6 routing and forwarding functions MUST be disabled on
      this interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:forwarding

      If this switch is set to "false" for a network-layer interface,
      then the forwarding of IPv6 datagrams through this interface MUST
      be disabled.  However, the interface MAY participate in other IPv6
      routing functions, such as routing protocols.

   In addition, the "ietf-ip" module allows for configuring IPv4 and
   IPv6 addresses and network prefixes or masks on network-layer
   interfaces.  Configuration of these parameters on an enabled
   interface MUST result in an immediate creation of the corresponding
   direct route.  The destination prefix of this route is set according
   to the configured IP address and network prefix/mask, and the
   interface is set as the outgoing interface for that route.

   This document registers the following YANG submodule in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020]:

   Name:      ietf-ipv6-router-advertisements
   Module:    ietf-ipv6-unicast-routing
   Reference: RFC 8349

11.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in these YANG modules that
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol:  This list
      specifies the control-plane protocols configured on a device.

   /routing/ribs/rib:  This list specifies the RIBs configured for the
      device.

   Some of the readable data nodes in these YANG modules may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol:  This list
      specifies the control-plane protocols configured on a device.
      Refer to the control-plane models for a list of sensitive

RFC 8349                 YANG Routing Management              March 2018


   /routing/ribs/rib:  This list specifies the RIBs and their contents
      for the device.  Access to this information may disclose the
      network topology and/or other information.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /routing/ribs/rib/active-route:  The output from this RPC operation
      returns the route that is being used for a specified destination.
      Access to this information may disclose the network topology or
      relationship (e.g., client/provider).  Additionally, the routes
      used by a network device may be used to mount a subsequent attack
      on traffic traversing the network device.

Appendix B.  Minimum Implementation

   Some parts and options of the core routing model, such as
   user-defined RIBs, are intended only for advanced routers.  This
   appendix gives basic non-normative guidelines for implementing a bare
   minimum of available functions.  Such an implementation may be used
   for hosts or very simple routers.

   A minimum implementation does not support the "multiple-ribs"
   feature.  This means that a single system-controlled RIB is available
   for each supported address family -- IPv4, IPv6, or both.  These RIBs
   are also the default RIBs.  No user-controlled RIBs are allowed.

   In addition to the mandatory instance of the "direct"
   pseudo-protocol, a minimum implementation should support configuring
   instance(s) of the "static" pseudo-protocol.

   For hosts that are never intended to act as routers, the ability to
   turn on sending IPv6 Router Advertisements (Section 5.4) should be
   removed.

   Platforms with severely constrained resources may use deviations for
   restricting the data model, e.g., limiting the number of "static"
   control-plane protocol instances.

Appendix C.  Example: Adding a New Control-Plane Protocol

   This appendix demonstrates how the core routing data model can be
   extended to support a new control-plane protocol.  The YANG module
   "example-rip" shown below is intended as an illustration rather than
   a real definition of a data model for the Routing Information
   Protocol (RIP).  For the sake of brevity, this module does not obey
   all the guidelines specified in [YANG-Guidelines].  See also
   Section 5.3.2.

   module example-rip {

     yang-version "1.1";
     namespace "http://example.com/rip";
     prefix "rip";

     import ietf-interfaces {

   A simple network setup as shown in Figure 2 is assumed: router "A"
   uses static default routes with the "ISP" router as the next hop.
   IPv6 Router Advertisements are configured only on the "eth1"
   interface and disabled on the upstream "eth0" interface.
