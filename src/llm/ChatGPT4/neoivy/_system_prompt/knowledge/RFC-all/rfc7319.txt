IANA Considerations for Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) Code Points

Abstract

   IEEE 802.1 has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) facilities.  CFM
   messages are structured with an OpCode field and have provision for
   the inclusion of TLV-structured information.  IEEE 802.1 has
   allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV Types to the IETF.  This
   document specifies the IANA considerations for the assignment of
   values from these blocks.

1.  Introduction

   The IEEE 802.1 Working Group has specified Connectivity Fault
   Management (CFM) [802.1Q] OAM [RFC6291] facilities.  CFM messages are
   structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion
   of TLV-structured information.

   IEEE 802.1 has allocated the block of 32 CFM OpCodes from 64 through
   95 and the block of 32 CFM TLV Types from 64 through 95 to the IETF
   (see Appendix A).  This document specifies the IANA considerations
   for the assignment of values from these two blocks.

   IEEE 802.1 previously allocated similar blocks of values from 32
   through 63 to ITU-T [Y.1731].

1.1.  Terminology

   Capitalized IANA terms such as "Standards Action" are to be
   interpreted as described in [RFC5226].

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the "Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) OAM IETF
   Parameters" registry with the following two subregistries:

      Registry Name: CFM OAM IETF OpCodes

      Registration Procedures: Standards Action

      Reference: [802.1Q] [RFC7319]

      Note: This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working Group
      that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to the IETF.

      Value    Assignment
      =====    ==========
      64-95    Unassigned

      Registry Name: CFM OAM IETF TLV Types

      Registration Procedures: Standards Action

      Reference: [802.1Q] [RFC7319]

      Note: This parameter originates with the IEEE 802.1 Working Group
      that has allocated the block of values from 64 to 95 to the IETF.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with assignment of values from the blocks
   of IEEE 802.1 CFM OpCodes and TLV Types that the IEEE 802.1 Working
   Group has allocated to the IETF.  It is not directly concerned with
   security.

Appendix A.  IEEE 802.1 WG Liaison

   To:         Jari Arkko, IETF chair
   cc:         Stephen J. Trowbridge, ITU-T SG15 chair,
               Donald Eastlake, Erik Nordmark, IETF TRILL WG,
               Eric Gray, IETF/IEEE liaison

   From:       Tony Jeffree, IEEE 802.1 WG Chair

   Date:       Thursday, 06 March 2014

   Reference:  24 September 2013 Liaison from TRILL WG

   After considering the referenced liaison from the TRILL WG, IEEE
   802.1 has voted to approve the allocation of code points from the
   Connectivity Fault Management protocol of IEEE Std 802.1Q(TM)-2011
   for use by IETF.  The expectation of IEEE 802.1 is that these code
   points will be allocated through IANA only on the basis of IETF
   standards actions.  Specifically, the allocation includes:

      + 32 CFM OpCode Field values. Reference IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011

        Clause 21.4.3, Table 21-4. The OpCode Field values 64-95
                                                                10
        are allocated to the IETF.


      + 32 TLV Type Field values. Reference IEEE Std 802.1Q-2011

        Clause 21.5.1.1, Table 21-6. The Type Field values 64-95
                                                                10
        are allocated to the IETF.

      IEEE Std 802.1Q will be revised at some future date to document
      this allocation. In the meantime, the allocation will be recorded
      through the IEEE 802.1 maintenance process.

      Regards,

      Tony Jeffree
      IEEE 802.1 Working Group Chair
