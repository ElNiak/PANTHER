                The Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes
           for Use in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure

Abstract

   asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key size, and signature format for
   the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) subscribers that
   generate digital signatures on certificates, Certificate Revocation
   Lists (CRLs), Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed objects and
   certification requests as well as for the relying parties (RPs) that
   verify these digital signatures.

RFC 7935                 RPKI Algorithm Profile              August 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies:

      *  the digital signature algorithm and parameters;

      *  the hash algorithm and parameters;

      *  the public and private key formats; and,

      *  the signature format

   used by Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480]
   subscribers when they apply digital signatures to certificates and
   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) [RFC5280], Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) signed objects [RFC5652] (e.g., Route Origin
   Authorizations (ROAs) [RFC6482] and manifests [RFC6486]), and
   certification requests [RFC2986] [RFC4211].  Relying parties (RPs)
   also use the algorithms defined in this document to verify RPKI
   subscribers' digital signatures [RFC6480].

   The RPKI profiles and specification documents that reference RFC 6485
   now refer to this document; these documents include the RPKI
   Certificate Policy (CP) [RFC6484], the RPKI Certificate Profile
   [RFC6487], the RPKI Architecture [RFC6480], and the Signed Object
   Template for the RPKI [RFC6488].  Familiarity with these documents is
   assumed.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Algorithms

   Two cryptographic algorithms are used in the RPKI:

      *  The signature algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, CMS signed
         objects, and certification requests is RSA Public-Key
         Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #1 Version 1.5 (sometimes
         referred to as "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5") from Section 8.2 of
         [RFC3447].

RFC 7935                 RPKI Algorithm Profile              August 2016


      *  The hashing algorithm used in certificates, CRLs, CMS signed
         objects and certification requests is SHA-256 [SHS] (see note
         below).

         NOTE: The exception is the use of SHA-1 [SHS] when CAs generate
         authority and subject key identifiers [RFC6487].

   In certificates, CRLs, and certification requests the hashing and
   digital signature algorithms are identified together, i.e., "RSA
   PKCS #1 v1.5 with SHA-256" or more simply "RSA with SHA-256".  The
   Object Identifier (OID) sha256WithRSAEncryption from [RFC4055] MUST
   be used in these products.

   The OID is in the following locations:

      In the certificate, the OID appears in the signature and
      signatureAlgorithm fields [RFC4055].

      In the CRL, the OID appears in the signatureAlgorithm field
      [RFC4055].

      In a certification request, the OID appears in the PKCS #10
      signatureAlgorithm field [RFC2986], or in the Certificate Request
      Message Format (CRMF) POPOSigningKey algorithmIdentifier field
      [RFC4211].

   In CMS SignedData, the hashing (message digest) and digital signature
   algorithms are identified separately.  The object identifier and
   parameters for SHA-256 (as defined in [RFC5754]) MUST be used for the
   SignedData digestAlgorithms field and the SignerInfo digestAlgorithm
   field.  The object identifier and parameters for rsaEncryption
   [RFC3370] MUST be used for the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field
   when generating CMS SignedData objects.  RPKI implementations MUST
   accept either rsaEncryption or sha256WithRSAEncryption for the
   SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field when verifying CMS SignedData
   objects (for compatibility with objects produced by implementations
   conforming to [RFC6485]).

3.  Asymmetric Key Pair Formats

   The RSA key pairs used to compute the signatures MUST have a 2048-bit
   modulus and a public exponent (e) of 65,537.

RFC 7935                 RPKI Algorithm Profile              August 2016


3.1.  Public Key Format

   The subject's public key is included in subjectPublicKeyInfo
   [RFC5280].  It has two sub-fields: algorithm and subjectPublicKey.
   The values for the structures and their sub-structures follow:

   algorithm (which is an AlgorithmIdentifier type):
      The object identifier for RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 with SHA-256 MUST be
      used in the algorithm field, as specified in Section 5 of
      [RFC4055].  The value for the associated parameters from that
      clause MUST also be used for the parameters field.

   subjectPublicKey:
      RSAPublicKey MUST be used to encode the certificate's
      subjectPublicKey field, as specified in [RFC4055].

3.2.  Private Key Format

   Local policy determines the private key format.

4.  Signature Format

   The structure for the certificate's signature field is as specified
   in Section 1.2 of [RFC4055].  The structure for the signature field
   in the CMS SignedData's SignerInfos is as specified in [RFC5652].

5.  Additional Requirements

   It is anticipated that the RPKI will require the adoption of updated
   key sizes and a different set of signature and hash algorithms over
   time, in order to maintain an acceptable level of cryptographic
   security to protect the integrity of signed products in the RPKI.
   This profile should be replaced to specify such future requirements,
   as and when appropriate.

   The procedures to implement such a transition of key sizes and
   algorithms are specified in [RFC6916].

6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations of [RFC4055], [RFC5280], and [RFC6487]
   apply to certificates and CRLs.  The Security Considerations of
   [RFC2986], [RFC4211], and [RFC6487] apply to certification requests.
   The Security Considerations of [RFC5754] apply to CMS signed objects.
   No new security threats are introduced as a result of this
   specification.

7.  Changes Applied to RFC 6485

   This update includes a slight technical change to [RFC6485] that is
   considered to be outside the limited scope of an erratum.  The
   document update process has included other errata and also corrected
   a number of nits.

   Section 2 of [RFC6485] specified sha256WithRSAEncryption as the OID
   to use for the SignerInfo signatureAlgorithm field in CMS
   SignedObjects.  However, existing implementations use the
   rsaEncryption OID for this field.  (Support for rsaEncryption in
   third-party cryptographic libraries is better than
   sha256WithRSAEncryption, perhaps because [RFC3370] says that support
   for rsaEncryption is required, while support for OIDs that specify
   both RSA and a digest algorithm is optional.)

   Rather than force existing implementations to switch to
   sha256WithRSAEncryption, this document was changed to follow existing
   practice.  This does not represent a cryptographic algorithm change,
   just an identifier change.  (Unlike certificates, CRLs, and
   certification requests, CMS signed objects have a separate algorithm
   identifier field for the hash (digest) algorithm, and that field is
   already required to contain the id-sha256 OID per Section 2.)

   To avoid compatibility problems, RPs are still required to accept
   sha256WithRSAEncryption if encountered.

   Other changes include:

      *  Minor wording and typo fixes.

      *  Corrections to references ([RFC5652] instead of [RFC3370],
         [RFC3447] instead of [RFC4055]).

      *  Additional citations included in the Introduction.

      *  Correction to the CRMF POPOSigningKey field that is mentioned
         in Section 2 (algorithmIdentifier instead of signature).

      *  Inclusion of certification requests in mentions of
         certificates, CRLs, and CMS signed objects.

      *  Replacement of text in Section 5 with a pointer to the
         procedures specified in [RFC6916] (algorithm agility).

      *  Replacement of "signed object" with "CMS signed object"
         everywhere.
