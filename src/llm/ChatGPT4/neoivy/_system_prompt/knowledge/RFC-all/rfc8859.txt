   A Framework for Session Description Protocol (SDP) Attributes When
                              Multiplexing

Abstract

   The purpose of this specification is to provide a framework for
   analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) attributes when SDP is used to negotiate the usage of
   a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with
   multiple media descriptions.

   This specification also categorizes the existing SDP attributes based
   on the framework described herein.

1.  Introduction

   SDP defines several attributes for capturing characteristics that
   apply to the individual media descriptions (described by "m=" lines)
   and the overall multimedia session.  Typically, different media types
   (audio, video, etc.) described using different media descriptions
   represent separate RTP sessions that are carried over individual
   transport-layer flows.  However, [RFC8843] defines a way to use a
   single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media
   associated with multiple SDP media descriptions.  This would, for
   example, allow the usage of a single set of Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) [RFC8445] candidates for multiple media
   descriptions.  This, in turn, has made it necessary to understand the
   interpretation and usage of the SDP attributes defined for the
   multiplexed media descriptions.

   Given the number of SDP attributes registered with the [IANA] and the
   possibility of new attributes being defined in the future, there is
   need for a framework to analyze these attributes for their
   applicability in the transport multiplexing use cases.

   The document starts with providing the motivation for requiring such
   a framework.  This is followed by introduction to the SDP attribute
   analysis framework and procedures, following which several sections
   apply the framework to the SDP attributes registered with the [IANA].

2.  Terminology

   5-tuple:  A collection of the following values: source address,
      source port, destination address, destination port, and transport-
      layer protocol.

   3GPP:  Third Generation Partnership Project; see
      <https://www.3gpp.org> for more information about this
      organization.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Motivation

   An effort to reduce the number of necessary transport-level flows is
   required because of the time and complications involved in setting up
   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC5763] transports for
   use by RTP based on ICE [RFC8445] and Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS).  These procedures motivate conservation of ports
   bindings on the Network Address Translators (NATs).  This necessity
   has resulted in the definition of ways, such as that described in
   [RFC8843], to multiplex RTP over a single transport flow in order to
   preserve network resources such as port numbers.  This imposes
   further restrictions on applicability of the SDP attributes as they
   are defined today.

   The specific problem is that there are attribute combinations that
   make sense when specified on independent "m=" lines -- as with
   classical SDP -- that do not make sense when those "m=" lines are
   then multiplexed over the same transport.  To give an obvious
   example, ICE permits each "m=" line to have an independently
   specified "ice-ufrag" attribute.  However, if the media from multiple
   "m=" lines is multiplexed over the same ICE component, then the
   meaning of media-level "ice-ufrag" attributes becomes muddled.

   At the time of writing this document, there are close to 250 SDP
   attributes registered with the [IANA], and more will be added in the
   future.  There is no clearly defined procedure to establish the
   validity/applicability of these attributes when used with transport
   multiplexing.

4.  SDP Attribute Analysis Framework

   Attributes in an SDP session description can be defined at the
   session level, media level, or source level.  Informally, there are
   various semantic groupings for these attributes.  One such grouping
   could be as follows:

   *  Attributes related to media content such as media type, encoding
      schemes, and payload types.

   *  Attributes specifying media transport characteristics such as RTP/
      RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) port numbers, network addresses, and
      QoS.

   *  Metadata description attributes capturing session timing and
      origin information.

   *  Attributes establishing relationships between media descriptions,
      such as grouping framework [RFC5888].

   The proposed framework analyzes the SDP attributes usage under
   multiplexing and assigns each SDP attribute to an appropriate
   multiplexing category.  Since the multiplexing categories defined in
   this specification are independent of any informal semantic groupings
   of the SDP attributes, the categorizations assigned are normative.

4.1.  Category: NORMAL

   The attributes in the NORMAL category can be independently specified
   when multiplexed, and they retain their original semantics.

   In the example given below, the direction and label attributes are
   independently specified for audio and video "m=" lines.  These
   attributes are not impacted by multiplexing these media streams over
   a single transport-layer flow.

        a=recvonly
        a=label:2
        a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000

4.2.  Category: CAUTION

   It is not advisable to multiplex with the attributes in the CAUTION
   category, since their usage under multiplexing might lead to
   incorrect behavior.

   Example: Multiplexing media descriptions over a single Datagram
   Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) transport [RFC5762] is not
   recommended, since DCCP is a connection-oriented protocol and
   therefore doesn't allow multiple connections on the same 5-tuple.

        a=dccp-service-code:SC=x5254504f
        a=setup:passive
        a=connection:new

4.3.  Category: IDENTICAL

   The attributes and their associated values (if any) in the IDENTICAL
   category MUST be repeated across all the media descriptions under
   multiplexing.

   Attributes such as rtcp-mux fall into this category.  Since RTCP
   reporting is done per RTP session, RTCP multiplexing MUST be enabled
   for both the audio and video "m=" lines if they are transported over
   a single 5-tuple.

        v=0
        o=bob 2890844527 2890844527 IN IP4 client.biloxi.example.com
        s=
        c=IN IP4 client.biloxi.example.com
        t=0 0
        m=audio 34567 RTP/AVP 97
        a=rtcp-mux
        m=video 34567 RTP/AVP 31
        a=rtpmap:31 H261/90000
        a=rtcp-mux

   Note: Even though IDENTICAL attributes must be repeated across all
   media descriptions under multiplexing, they might not always be
   explicitly encoded across all media descriptions.  [RFC8843] defines
   rules for when attributes and their values are implicitly applied to
   media description.

4.4.  Category: SUM

   The attributes in the SUM category can be set as they are normally
   used, but software using them in the multiplexing scenario MUST apply
   the sum of all the attributes being multiplexed instead of trying to
   use them independently.  This is typically used for bandwidth or
   other rate-limiting attributes to the underlying transport.

   The software parsing the SDP sample below should use the aggregate
   Application Specific (AS) bandwidth value from the individual media
   descriptions to determine the AS value for the multiplexed session.
   Thus the calculated AS value would be 256+64 kilobits per second for
   the given example.

         b=AS:64
         m=video 51372 RTP/AVP 31
         b=AS:256

4.5.  Category: TRANSPORT

   The attributes in the TRANSPORT category can be set normally for
   multiple items in a multiplexed group, but the software MUST pick the
   one that's associated with the "m=" line whose information is used
   for setting up the underlying transport.

   In the example below, the "a=crypto" attribute is defined for both
   the audio and video "m=" lines.  The video media line's "a=crypto"
   attribute is chosen since its MID value (bar) appears first in the
   "a=group:BUNDLE" line.  This is due to the BUNDLE grouping semantic
   [RFC8843], which mandates that the values from the "m=" line
   corresponding to the mid appearing first on the "a=group:BUNDLE" line
   be considered for setting up the RTP transport.

        a=group:BUNDLE bar foo

        a=rtpmap:96 H261/90000

4.6.  Category: INHERIT

   The attributes in the INHERIT category encapsulate other SDP
   attributes or parameters.  These attributes inherit their
   multiplexing characteristics from the attributes or parameters they
   encapsulate.  Such attributes are defined in [RFC3407], [RFC5939],
   and [RFC6871] as part of a generic framework for indicating and
   negotiating capabilities in the SDP related to transport, media, and
   media format.

   The inheritance manifests itself when the encapsulated attribute or
   parameter is being leveraged.  In the case of SDP Capability
   Negotiation [RFC5939], for example, this occurs when a capability
   (encapsulating attribute) is used as part of a configuration; the
   configuration inherits the multiplexing category of each of its
   constituent (encapsulated) attributes and parameters.  The inherited
   attributes MUST be coherent in order to form a valid configuration
   from a multiplexing point of view (see Section 14 for further
   details).

          o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
          s=
          c=IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
          t=0 0
          m=video 3456 RTP/AVP 100
          a=rtpmap:100 VP8/90000
          a=fmtp:100 max-fr=30;max-fs=8040
          a=sqn: 0
          a=cdsc: 1 video RTP/AVP 100
          a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux
          m=video 3456 RTP/AVP 101
          a=rtpmap:101 VP8/90000
          a=fmtp:100 max-fr=15;max-fs=1200
          a=cdsc: 2 video RTP/AVP 101
          a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux

   In this example, the category IDENTICAL is inherited by the cpar-
   encapsulated "rtcp-mux" attribute.

4.7.  Category: IDENTICAL-PER-PT

   The attributes in the IDENTICAL-PER-PT category define the RTP
   payload configuration on the basis of the payload type, and they MUST
   have identical values across all the media descriptions for a given
   RTP payload type when repeated.  These payload types identify the
   same codec configuration as defined in Section 9.1 of [RFC8843] under
   this context.

   In the SDP example below, Payload Types 96 and 97 are repeated across
   all the video "m=" lines, and all the payload-specific parameters
   (for example, rtpmap and fmtp) are identical.  (Note: some line
   breaks are due to formatting only.)

4.8.  Category: SPECIAL

   For the attributes in the SPECIAL category, the text in the
   specification defining the attribute MUST be consulted for further
   handling when multiplexed.

   As an example, for the attribute "extmap" [RFC5285], the
   specification defining the extension needs to be consulted to
   understand the multiplexing implications.

4.9.  Category: TBD

   The attributes in the TBD category have not been analyzed under the
   proposed multiplexing framework and SHOULD NOT be multiplexed.

5.  Analysis of Existing Attributes

   This section analyzes attributes listed in [IANA], grouped under the
   IETF document that defines them.

   The "Level" column indicates whether the attribute is currently
   specified as:

   *  S -- Session level

   *  M -- Media level

   *  B -- Both (Implies either a session level or a media level
      attribute)

   *  SR -- Source-level (for a single SSRC) [RFC5576]

   The "Mux Category" column identifies the multiplexing category
   assigned to each attribute, and the "Notes" column captures
   additional informative details regarding the assigned category,
   wherever necessary.

5.1.  RFC 4566: SDP

   [RFC4566] defines SDP that is intended for describing multimedia
   sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session
   invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation.

   extensible through IANA registration.  This document also discusses
   how network quality of service can be made a precondition for
   establishment of sessions initiated by the Session Initiation

5.5.  RFC 4574: SDP "label" Attribute

   [RFC4574] defines a new SDP media-level attribute: "label".  The
   "label" attribute carries a pointer to a media stream in the context
   of an arbitrary network application that uses SDP.  The sender of the
   SDP document can attach the "label" attribute to a particular media
   stream or streams.  The application can then use the provided pointer
   to refer to each particular media stream in its context.

   RTP is a widely used transport for real-time multimedia on IP
   networks.  DCCP is a transport protocol that provides desirable
   services for real-time applications.  [RFC5762] specifies a mapping
   of RTP onto DCCP, along with associated signaling, such that real-
   time applications can make use of the services provided by DCCP.

                    Table 8: RFC 5762 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: If RFC 6773 is being used in addition to RFC 5762, and the
   DCCP-in-UDP layer has additional demultiplexing, then it may be
   possible to use different DCCP service codes for each DCCP flow,
   given each uses a different DCCP port.  However, doing so might
   conflict with the media type of the "m=" line.  None of this is
   standardized yet, and it wouldn't work as explained.  Hence
   performing multiplexing is not recommended even in this alternate
   scenario.

5.9.  RFC 6773: DCCP-UDP Encapsulation

   [RFC6773] specifies an alternative encapsulation of DCCP, referred to
   as DCCP-UDP.  This encapsulation allows DCCP to be carried through
   the current generation of Network Address Translation (NAT)
   middleboxes without modification of those middleboxes.

      +-----------+------------------------------+-------+----------+

                    Table 9: RFC 6773 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: RFC 6773 allows DCCP-UDP encapsulation, with the UDP port being
   the port of the DCCP encapsulation/decapsulation service.  This
   encapsulation allows arbitrary DCCP packets to be encapsulated, and
   the DCCP port chosen can conflict with the port chosen for the RTP
   traffic.  Multiplexing several DCCP-in-UDP encapsulations on the same
   UDP port with no RTP traffic on the same port implies collapsing
   several DCCP port spaces together.  Whether or not this works depends
   on the nature of DCCP encapsulation and ports choices; it is thus
   very application dependent.

5.10.  RFC 5506: Reduced-Size RTCP in RTP Profile

5.11.  RFC 6787: Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2

   The Media Resource Control Protocol Version 2 (MRCPv2) allows client
   hosts to control media service resources such as speech synthesizers,
   recognizers, verifiers, and identifiers residing in servers on the
   network.  MRCPv2 is not a "stand-alone" protocol; it relies on other
   protocols, such as the SIP, to coordinate MRCPv2 clients and servers
   and manage session between them, and SDP to describe, discover, and
   exchange capabilities.  It also depends on SIP and SDP to establish
   the media sessions and associated parameters between the media source
   or sink and the media server.  Once this is done, the MRCPv2 exchange
   operates over the control session established above, allowing the
   client to control the media-processing resources on the speech
   resource server.  [RFC6787] defines attributes for this purpose.

   [RFC5285] provides a general mechanism for using the header-extension
   feature of RTP.  (Note: [RFC5285] has been obsoleted by [RFC8285].)
   It provides the option to use a small number of small extensions in
   each RTP packet, where the universe of possible extensions is large
   and registration is decentralized.  The actual extensions in use in a
   session are signaled in the setup information for that session.

   A possible use case is to make it possible for a low-end handheld
   terminal to display video without the need to rescale the image,
   something that may consume large amounts of memory and processing
   power.  The document also helps to maintain an optimal bitrate for
   video as only the image size that is desired by the receiver is
   transmitted.

   auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the reference information to
   the receiver precedes or accompanies the multicast stream.  This
   unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a faster-than-natural bitrate
   to further accelerate the acquisition.  The motivating use case for
   this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time
   compressed audio and video.

   NOTE: The attributes "a=cparmin" and "a=cparmax" define minimum and
   maximum numerical values associated with the attributes described in
   "a=cpar".

   Since the cpar attribute can either define a "b=" attribute or any
   "a=" attribute, the multiplexing category depends on the actual
   attribute being encapsulated and the implications of the numerical
   values assigned.  Hence it is recommended to consult the
   specification defining attributes "cparmin" and "cparmax" to further
   analyze their behavior under multiplexing.

5.25.  RFC 6284: Port Mapping between Unicast and Multicast RTP Sessions

   applications using both unicast and multicast services.  The solution
   provides protection against denial-of-service or packet amplification
   attacks that could be used to cause one or more RTP packets to be
   sent to a victim client.

   the MSRP connection without the need for middleboxes to modify the
   MSRP messages; thus, it also enables secure end-to-end MSRP

                  Table 33: RFC 6871 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: The "sescap" attribute is not recommended for use with
   multiplexing.  The reason is that it requires the use of unique
   configuration numbers across the entire SDP (per [RFC6871]) as
   opposed to within a media description only (per [RFC5939]).  As
   described in Section 14, the use of identical configuration numbers
   between multiplexed (bundled) media descriptions is the default way
   of indicating compatible configurations in a bundle.

5.34.  RFC 7006: Miscellaneous Capabilities Negotiation in SDP

   [RFC7006] extends the SDP Capability Negotiation framework to allow
   endpoints to negotiate three additional SDP capabilities.  In
   particular, this memo provides a mechanism to negotiate bandwidth
   ("b=" line), connection data ("c=" line), and session or media titles
   ("i=" line for each session or media).

   defines a new SDP protocol identifier, "TCP/TLS".  It also defines
   the syntax and semantics for an SDP "fingerprint" attribute that

   to be established securely, so long as the integrity of session
   descriptions is assured.

5.38.  RFC 6128: RTCP Port for Multicast Sessions

   SDP has an attribute that allows RTP applications to specify an
   address and a port associated with the RTCP traffic.  In RTP-based
   source-specific multicast (SSM) sessions, the same attribute is used
   to designate the address and the RTCP port of the Feedback Target in
   the SDP description.  However, the RTCP port associated with the SSM
   session itself cannot be specified by the same attribute to avoid
   ambiguity and thus is required to be derived from the "m=" line of
   the media description.  Deriving the RTCP port from the "m=" line
   imposes an unnecessary restriction.  [RFC6128] removes this
   restriction by introducing a new SDP attribute.

                  Table 42: RFC 7195 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: [RFC7195] defines SDP attributes for establishing audio and
   video media streams over circuit-switched bearers by defining a new
   nettype value, "PSTN".  However, Section 7.2 of [RFC8843] requires
   the "c=" line nettype value to be "IN".  If there exists in future a
   specification that defines procedures to multiplex media streams over
   nettype "PSTN", the multiplexing categories for attributes in this
   section could be revisited.

   [RFC6193] specifies how to establish a media session that represents
   a virtual private network using the Session Initiation Protocol for
   the purpose of on-demand media/application sharing between peers.  It
   extends the protocol identifier of SDP so that it can negotiate use
   of the Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) for media sessions in the
   SDP offer/answer model.

                  Table 49: RFC 3108 Attribute Analysis

   NOTE: RFC 3108 describes conventions for using SDP for characterizing
   ATM bearer connections using an AAL1, AAL2, or AAL5 adaptation layer.
   For AAL1, AAL2, and AAL5, bearer connections can be used to transport
   single media streams.  In addition, for AAL1 and AAL2, multiple media
   streams can be multiplexed into a bearer connection.  For all
   adaptation types (AAL1, AAL2, and AAL5), bearer connections can be
   bundled into a single media group.  In all cases addressed by RFC
   3108, a real-time media stream (voice, video, voiceband data,
   pseudowire, and others) or a multiplex of media streams is mapped
   directly into an ATM connection.  RFC 3108 does not address cases
   where ATM serves as a low-level transport pipe for IP packets that
   can, in turn, carry one or more real-time (e.g., VoIP) media sessions
   with a life cycle different from that of the underlying ATM
   transport.

6.3.  RFC 3890: Bandwidth Modifier for SDP

   [RFC3890] defines SDP Transport Independent Application Specific
   Maximum (TIAS) bandwidth modifier that does not include transport
   overhead; instead, an additional packet-rate attribute is defined.
   The transport-independent bitrate value together with the maximum
   packet rate can then be used to calculate the real bitrate over the
   transport actually used.

   +-------------+----------------------------------+-------+----------+

                     Table 59: RFC 3890 bwtype Analysis

   NOTE: The intention of TIAS is that the media-level bitrate is
   multiplied with the known per-packet overhead for the selected
   transport and the maxprate value to determine the worst-case bitrate
   from the transport to more accurately capture the required usage.
   Summing TIAS values independently across "m=" lines and multiplying
   the computed sum with maxprate and the per-packet overhead would
   inflate the value significantly.  Instead, performing multiplication
   and adding the individual values is a more appropriate usage.

   [RFC6285] describes a method of using the existing RTP and RTCP
   machinery that reduces the acquisition delay.  In this method, an
   auxiliary unicast RTP session carrying the Reference Information to
   the receiver precedes or accompanies the multicast stream.  This
   unicast RTP flow can be transmitted at a faster-than-natural bitrate
   to further accelerate the acquisition.  The motivating use case for
   this capability is multicast applications that carry real-time
   compressed audio and video.

   mechanism.  It defines a new RTCP Extended Report (XR) block for

7.5.  RFC 6642: Third-Party Loss Report

   In a large RTP session using the RTCP feedback mechanism defined in
   [RFC4585], a feedback target may experience transient overload if
   some event causes a large number of receivers to send feedback at
   once.  This overload is usually avoided by ensuring that feedback
   reports are forwarded to all receivers, allowing them to avoid
   sending duplicate feedback reports.  However, there are cases where
   it is not recommended to forward feedback reports, and this may allow
   feedback implosion.  [RFC6642] discusses these cases and defines a
   new RTCP Third-Party Loss Report that can be used to inform receivers
   that the feedback target is aware of some loss event, allowing them
   to suppress feedback.  Associated SDP signaling is also defined.

   the exclusive-or (parity) operation.  The payload format allows end
   systems to apply protection using various protection lengths and
   levels, in addition to using various protection group sizes to adapt
   to different media and channel characteristics.  It enables complete
   recovery of the protected packets or partial recovery of the critical
   parts of the payload, depending on the packet loss situation.

14.  Multiplexing Considerations for Encapsulating Attributes

   This section deals with recommendations for defining the multiplexing
   characteristics of the SDP attributes that encapsulate other SDP
   attributes/parameters.  As of today, such attributes, for example,
   are defined in [RFC3407], [RFC5939] and [RFC6871] as part of a
   generic framework for indicating and negotiating transport-, media-,
   and media-format-related capabilities in the SDP.

   The behavior of such attributes under multiplexing is, in turn,
   defined by the multiplexing behavior of the attributes they
   encapsulate, which are made known once the offer/answer negotiation
   process is completed.

14.1.  RFC 3407: cpar Attribute Analysis

   The [RFC3407] capability parameter attribute "a=cpar" encapsulates a
   "b=" (bandwidth) or an "a=" attribute.  For bandwidth attribute
   encapsulation, the category SUM is inherited.  For the case of "a="
   attribute, the category corresponding to the SDP attribute being
   encapsulated is inherited.

    a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux

    a=rtpmap:101 VP8/90000
    a=fmtp:100 max-fr=15;max-fs=1200
    a=cdsc: 2 video RTP/AVP 101
    a=cpar: a=rtcp-mux

   In this example, the category IDENTICAL is inherited for the cpar-
   encapsulated "rtcp-mux" attribute.


14.2.  RFC 5939 Analysis

   [RFC5939] defines a general SDP capability negotiation framework.  It
   also specifies how to provide transport protocols and SDP attributes
   as capabilities and negotiate them using the framework.

   For this purpose, [RFC5939] defines the following:

   *  A set of capabilities for the session and its associated media-
      stream components, supported by each side.  The attribute "a=acap"
      defines how to list an attribute name and its associated value (if
      any) as a capability.  The attribute "a=tcap" defines how to list
      transport protocols (e.g., "RTP/AVP") as capabilities.

   *  A set of potential configurations ("a=pcfg") provided by the
      offerer to indicate which combinations of those capabilities can
      be used for the session and its associated media stream
      components.  Potential configurations are not ready for use until
      fully negotiated.  They provide an alternative that MAY be used,
      subject to SDP capability-negotiation procedures.  In particular,
      the answerer MAY choose one of the potential configurations for
      use as part of the current offer/answer exchange.

   *  An actual configuration ("a=acfg") for the session and its
      associated media stream components.  The actual configuration
      identifies the potential configuration that was negotiated for
      use.  Use of an actual configuration does not require any further
      negotiation.

   *  A negotiation process that takes the current actual and the set of
      potential configurations (combinations of capabilities) as input
      and provides the negotiated actual configurations as output.  In
      [RFC5939], the negotiation process is done independently for each
      media description.

14.2.1.  Recommendation: Procedures for Potential Configuration Pairing

   This section provides recommendations for entities generating and
   processing SDP under the generic capability-negotiation framework as
   defined in [RFC5939] under the context of media-stream multiplexing.

   These recommendations are provided for the purposes of enabling the
   offerer to make sure that the generated potential configurations
   between the multiplexed streams can (easily) be negotiated to be
   consistent between those streams.  In particular, the procedures aim
   to simplify the answerer's procedure for choosing potential
   configurations that are consistent across all the multiplexed media
   descriptions.

   A potential configuration selects a set of attributes and parameters
   that become part of the media description when negotiated.  When
   multiplexing media descriptions with potential configurations
   specified, there MAY be a need for coordinating this selection
   between multiplexed media descriptions to ensure the right
   multiplexing behavior.

   Although it is possible to analyze the various potential
   configurations in multiplexed media descriptions to find combinations
   that satisfy such constraints, it can quickly become complicated to
   do so.

   The procedures defined in [RFC5939] state that each potential
   configuration in the SDP has a unique configuration number; however,
   the scope of uniqueness is limited to each media description.  To
   make it simple for the answerer to chose valid combinations of
   potential configurations across media descriptions in a given BUNDLE
   group, we provide a simple rule for constructing potential
   configurations:

   *  Let m-bundle be the set of media descriptions that form a given
      bundle.

   *  Let m-bundle-pcfg be the set of media descriptions in m-bundle
      that include one or more potential configurations.

   *  Each media description in m-bundle-pcfg MUST have at least one
      potential configuration with the same configuration number (e.g.,
      "1").

   *  For each potential configuration with configuration number x in m-
      bundle-pcfg, the offerer MUST ensure that if the answerer chooses
      configuration number x in each of the media descriptions in m-
      bundle-pcfg, then the resulting SDP will have all multiplexing
      constraints satisfied for those media descriptions.

   *  Since it is nearly impossible to define a generic mechanism for
      various capability extensions, this document doesn't provide
      procedures for dealing with the capability-extension attributes.
      However, Section 14.3 provides analysis of media-capability-
      extension attributes as defined in [RFC6871].

   The above allows the answerer to easily find multiplexing-compatible
   combinations of potential configurations.  The answerer simply
   chooses a potential configuration (number) that is present in all of
   the media descriptions with potential configurations in the bundle.

   Note that it is still possible for the offerer to provide additional
   potential configurations with independent configuration numbers.  The
   answerer will have to perform more complicated analysis to determine
   valid multiplexed combinations of those.

14.2.1.1.  Example: Transport-Capability Multiplexing

   v=0
   o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
   s=
   c=IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
   t=0 0
   a=tcap:1 RTP/SAVPF
   a=tcap:2 RTP/SAVP
   a=group:BUNDLE audio video
   m=audio
   a=mid:audio
   a=pcfg:1 t=1
   a=pcfg:2
   m=video
   a=mid:video
   a=pcfg:1 t=1
   a=pcfg:2 t=2

   In this example, the potential configurations that offer transport-
   protocol capability of RTP/SAVPF have the same configuration number
   "1" in both the audio and video media descriptions.

14.2.1.2.  Example: Attribute-Capability Multiplexing

   v=0
   o=alice 2890844526 2890844527 IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
   s=
   c=IN IP4 host.atlanta.example.com
   t=0 0
   a=acap:1 a=rtcp-mux
   a=acap:2 a=crypto:1 AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80
     inline:EcGZiNWpFJhQXdspcl1ekcmVCNWpVLcfHAwJSoj|2^20|1:32
   a=group:BUNDLE audio video
   m=audio 49172 RTP/AVP 99
   a=mid:audio
   a=pcfg:1 a=1
   a=pcfg:2
   m=video 560024 RTP/AVP 100
   a=mid:video
   a=pcfg:1 a=1
   a=pcfg:2 a=2

   In this example, the potential configuration number "1" is repeated
   while referring to attribute capability a=rtcp-mux, since the
   behavior is IDENTICAL for the attribute a=rtcp-mux under
   multiplexing.

14.3.  RFC 6871 Analysis

   [RFC6871] extends the capability negotiation framework described in
   [RFC5939] by defining media capabilities that can be used to indicate
   and negotiate media types and their associated format parameters.  It
   also allows indication of latent configurations and session
   capabilities.

14.3.1.  Recommendation: Dealing with Payload Type Numbers

   [RFC6871] defines a new payload type parameter ("pt") to be used with
   the potential, actual, and latent configuration parameters.  The
   parameter associates RTP payload type numbers with the referenced
   RTP-based media-format capabilities ("a=rmcap") defined in [RFC6871]
   and is appropriate only when the transport protocol uses RTP.  This
   means that the same payload type number can be assigned as part of
   potential or actual configurations in different media descriptions in
   a bundle.  There are rules for the usage of identical payload type
   values across multiplexed "m=" lines, described in [RFC8843], which
   must be followed here, as well.  As described in Section 14.2.1, the
   use of identical configuration numbers for compatible configurations
   in different media descriptions that are part of the bundle provides
   a way to ensure that the answerer can easily pick compatible
   configurations here, as well.

14.3.1.1.  Example: Attribute Capability under Shared Payload Type

   The attributes "a=rmcap" and "a=mfcap" follow the above
   recommendations under multiplexing.

   v=0
   o=- 25678 753849 IN IP4 192.0.2.1
   s=
   c=IN IP4 192.0.2.1
   t=0 0
   a=creq:med-v0
   m=audio 54322 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 AMR-WB/16000/1
   a=fmtp:96 mode-change-capability=1; max-red=220;
   mode-set=0,2,4,7
   a=rmcap:1,3 audio AMR-WB/16000/1
   a=rmcap:2 audio AMR/8000/1
   a=mfcap:1,2 mode-change-capability=1
   a=mfcap:3 mode-change-capability=2
   a=pcfg:1 m=1 pt=1:96
   a=pcfg:2 m=2 pt=2:97
   a=pcfg:3 m=3 pt=3:98
   m=audio 54322 RTP/AVP 96
   a=rtpmap:96 AMR-WB/16000/1
   a=fmtp:96 mode-change-capability=1; max-red=220;
   mode-set=0,2,4,7
   a=rmcap:4 audio AMR/8000/1
   a=rmcap:5 audio OPUS/48000/2
   a=mfcap:5 minptime=40
   a=mfcap:4 mode-change-capability=1
   a=pcfg:1 m=4 pt=4:97
   a=pcfg:4 m=5 pt=5:101

   In this example, the potential configuration number "1" is repeated
   when referring to media and media-format capability used for the
   Payload Type 96.  This implies that both media capabilities 2 and 4,
   along with their media-format capabilities, MUST refer to the same
   codec configuration, as per the definition of IDENTICAL-PER-PT.

14.3.2.  Recommendation: Dealing with Latent Configurations

   [RFC6871] adds the notion of a latent configuration that provides
   configuration information that may be used to guide a subsequent
   offer/exchange -- e.g., by adding another media stream or using
   alternative codec combinations not currently offered.  Latent
   configurations have configuration numbers that cannot overlap with
   the potential configuration numbers [RFC6871].  Supported
   combinations of potential and latent configurations are indicated by
   use of the "a=sescap" attribute; however, use of this attribute is
   not recommended with multiplexed media, since it requires the use of
   unique configuration numbers across the SDP.  Taken together, this
   means there is no well-defined way to indicate supported combinations
   of latent configurations, or combinations of latent and potential
   configurations with multiplexed media.  It is still allowed to use
   the latent configuration attribute; however, the limitations above
   will apply.  To determine valid combinations, actual negotiation will
   have to be attempted subsequently instead.

15.  IANA Considerations

   Section 15.1 defines a new subregistry, which has been added by the
   IANA, for identifying the initial registrations for various
   multiplexing categories applicable, as described in this document.

   IANA has added a new column named "Mux Category" to several of the
   subregistries in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters"
   registry.  The tables in Section 15.2 identify the names of entries
   in the existing subregistry and specify the value to be put in the
   new "Mux Category" column of the associated IANA registry for each.

15.1.  New "Multiplexing Categories" Subregistry

   A new subregistry has been created.  It is called "Multiplexing
   Categories" and has the following registrations initially:

   +=========================+===========+
   | Multiplexing Categories | Reference |
   +=========================+===========+
   | NORMAL                  | RFC 8859  |
   +-------------------------+-----------+

   +-------------------------+-----------+
   | TBD                     | RFC 8859  |
   +-------------------------+-----------+

                   Table 80

   Further entries can be registered using Standard Actions policies
   outlined in [RFC8126], which requires IESG review and approval and
   Standards Track IETF RFC publication.

   Each registration needs to indicate the multiplexing category value
   to be added to the "Multiplexing Categories" subregistry, as defined
   in this section.

   Such a registration MUST also indicate the applicability of the newly
   defined multiplexing category value to various subregistries defined
   in the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.

15.2.  "Mux Category" Column for Subregistries

   Each subsection identifies a subregistry of the "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The tables list the column that
   identifies the SDP attribute name/Token/Value from the corresponding
   subregistries and the values to be used for the new "Mux Category"
   column to be added.

   Entries in the existing subregistries of the "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry that lack a value for the "Mux
   Category" in this specification will get a value of "TBD".

   The registration policy for updates to the "Mux Category" column
   values for existing parameters, or when registering new parameters,
   is beyond the scope of this document.  The registration policy for
   the affected table is defined in [RFC8866].

15.2.1.  Table: SDP bwtype

   The following values have been added to the "bwtype" subregistry of
   the "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The
   references have been updated to point to this RFC as well as the
   previous references.

   +==========+==============+

             Table 81

15.2.2.  Table: attribute-name

   The following values have been added to the "attribute-name"
   (formerly "att-field") subregistry of the "Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.  The references have been
   updated to point to this RFC as well as the previous references.

   NOTE: The attributes from [FLUTE] ("flute-tsi", "flute-ch", "FEC-
   declaration", "FEC-OTI-extension", "content-desc") were not analyzed
   for their multiplexing behavior, due to the expired status of the
   draft.  For the purposes of this specification, the multiplexing
   category of "TBD" is assigned.

16.  Security Considerations

   The primary security considerations for RTP, including the way it is
   used here, are described in [RFC3550] and [RFC3711].

   When multiplexing SDP attributes with the category "CAUTION", the
   implementations should be aware of possible issues described in this
   specification.
