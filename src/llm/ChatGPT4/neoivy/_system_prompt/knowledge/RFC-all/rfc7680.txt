RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a metric for one-way packet loss across Internet
   paths.  It builds on notions introduced and discussed in the IPPM
   Framework document, [RFC2330]; the reader is assumed to be familiar
   with that document and its recent update [RFC7312].

   This memo is intended to be parallel in structure to a companion
   document for One-way Delay ("A One-Way Delay Metric for IP
   Performance Metrics (IPPM)") [RFC7679]; the reader is assumed to be
   familiar with that document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  Although
   [RFC2119] was written with protocols in mind, the key words are used
   in this document for similar reasons.  They are used to ensure the
   results of measurements from two different implementations are
   comparable and to note instances when an implementation could perturb
   the network.

   Whenever a technical term from the IPPM Framework document is first
   used in this memo, it will be tagged with a trailing asterisk.  For
   example, "term*" indicates that "term" is defined in the Framework
   document.

   The structure of the memo is as follows:

   o  A 'singleton*' analytic metric, called Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss,
      is introduced to measure a single observation of packet
      transmission or loss.

   o  Using this singleton metric, a 'sample*' called Type-P-One-way-
      Packet-Loss-Poisson-Stream is introduced to measure a sequence of
      singleton transmissions and/or losses measured at times taken from
      a Poisson process, as defined in Section 11.1.1 of [RFC2330].

   o  Using this sample, several 'statistics*' of the sample will be
      defined and discussed.

   This progression from singleton to sample to statistics, with clear
   separation among them, is important.

1.1.  Motivation

   Understanding one-way packet loss of Type-P* packets from a source
   host* to a destination host is useful for several reasons:

   o  Some applications do not perform well (or at all) if end-to-end
      loss between hosts is large relative to some threshold value.

   o  Excessive packet loss may make it difficult to support certain
      real-time applications (where the precise threshold of "excessive"
      depends on the application).

   o  The larger the value of packet loss, the more difficult it is for
      transport-layer protocols to sustain high bandwidths.

   o  The sensitivity of real-time applications and of transport-layer
      protocols to loss become especially important when very large
      delay-bandwidth products must be supported.

   The measurement of one-way loss instead of round-trip loss is
   motivated by the following factors:

   o  In today's Internet, the path from a source to a destination may
      be different than the path from the destination back to the source
      ("asymmetric paths"), such that different sequences of routers are
      used for the forward and reverse paths.  Therefore, round-trip
      measurements actually measure the performance of two distinct
      paths together.  Measuring each path independently highlights the
      performance difference between the two paths that may traverse
      different Internet service providers and even radically different
      types of networks (for example, research versus commodity
      networks, or networks with asymmetric link capacities, or wireless
      versus wireline access).

   o  Even when the two paths are symmetric, they may have radically
      different performance characteristics due to asymmetric queuing.

   o  Performance of an application may depend mostly on the performance
      in one direction.  For example, a TCP-based communication will
      experience reduced throughput if congestion occurs in one
      direction of its communication.  Troubleshooting may be simplified
      if the congested direction of TCP transmission can be identified.

   o  In networks in which quality of service (QoS) is enabled,
      provisioning in one direction may be radically different than
      provisioning in the reverse direction and thus the QoS guarantees
      differ.  Measuring the paths independently allows the verification
      of both guarantees.

   It is outside the scope of this document to say precisely how loss
   metrics would be applied to specific problems.

1.2.  General Issues regarding Time

   {Comment: The terminology below differs from that defined by ITU-T
   documents (e.g., G.810, "Definitions and terminology for
   synchronization networks" and I.356, "B-ISDN ATM layer cell transfer
   performance") but is consistent with the IPPM Framework document.  In
   general, these differences derive from the different backgrounds; the
   ITU-T documents historically have a telephony origin, while the
   authors of this document (and the Framework document) have a computer
   systems background.  Although the terms defined below have no direct
   equivalent in the ITU-T definitions, after our definitions we will
   provide a rough mapping.  However, note one potential confusion: our
   definition of "clock" is the computer operating systems definition
   denoting a time-of-day clock, while the ITU-T definition of clock
   denotes a frequency reference.}

   Whenever a time (i.e., a moment in history) is mentioned here, it is
   understood to be measured in seconds (and fractions) relative to UTC.

   As described more fully in the Framework document, there are four
   distinct, but related notions of clock uncertainty:

   synchronization*

   measures the extent to which two clocks agree on what time it is.
   For example, the clock on one host might be 5.4 msec ahead of the
   clock on a second host. {Comment: A rough ITU-T equivalent is "time
   error".}

   accuracy*

   measures the extent to which a given clock agrees with UTC.  For
   example, the clock on a host might be 27.1 msec behind UTC. {Comment:
   A rough ITU-T equivalent is "time error from UTC".}

   resolution*

   is a specification of the smallest unit by which the clock's time is
   updated.  It gives a lower bound on the clock's uncertainty.  For
   example, the clock on an old Unix host might tick only once every 10
   msec and thus have a resolution of only 10 msec. {Comment: A very
   rough ITU-T equivalent is "sampling period".}

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   skew*

   measures the change of accuracy, or of synchronization, with time.
   For example, the clock on a given host might gain 1.3 msec per hour
   and thus be 27.1 msec behind UTC at one time and only 25.8 msec an
   hour later.  In this case, we say that the clock of the given host
   has a skew of 1.3 msec per hour relative to UTC, which threatens
   accuracy.  We might also speak of the skew of one clock relative to
   another clock, which threatens synchronization. {Comment: A rough
   ITU-T equivalent is "time drift".}

2.  A Singleton Definition for One-Way Packet Loss

2.1.  Metric Name

   Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss

2.2.  Metric Parameters

   o  Src, the IP address of a host

   o  Dst, the IP address of a host

   o  T, a time

   o  Tmax, a loss threshold waiting time

2.3.  Metric Units

   The value of a Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss is either a zero
   (signifying successful transmission of the packet) or a one
   (signifying loss).

2.4.  Definition

   >>The *Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss* from Src to Dst at T is 0<< means
   that Src sent the first bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire time* T
   and that Dst received that packet.

   >>The *Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss* from Src to Dst at T is 1<< means
   that Src sent the first bit of a Type-P packet to Dst at wire time T
   and that Dst did not receive that packet (within the loss threshold
   waiting time, Tmax).

2.5.  Discussion

   Thus, Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss is 0 exactly when Type-P-One-way-
   Delay is a finite value, and it is 1 exactly when Type-P-One-way-
   Delay is undefined.

   The following issues are likely to come up in practice:

   o  A given methodology will have to include a way to distinguish
      between a packet loss and a very large (but finite) delay.  As
      noted by Mahdavi and Paxson [RFC2678], simple upper bounds (such
      as the 255-second theoretical upper bound on the lifetimes of IP
      packets [RFC791]) could be used, but good engineering, including
      an understanding of packet lifetimes, will be needed in practice.
      {Comment: Note that, for many applications of these metrics, there
      may be no harm in treating a large delay as packet loss.  An audio
      playback packet, for example, that arrives only after the playback
      point may as well have been lost.  See Section 4.1.1 of [RFC6703]
      for examination of unusual packet delays and application
      performance estimation.}

   o  If the packet arrives but is corrupted, then it is counted as
      lost. {Comment: One is tempted to count the packet as received
      since corruption and packet loss are related but distinct
      phenomena.  If the IP header is corrupted, however, one cannot be
      sure about the source or destination IP addresses and is thus on
      shaky grounds about knowing that the corrupted received packet
      corresponds to a given sent test packet.  Similarly, if other
      parts of the packet needed by the methodology to know that the
      corrupted received packet corresponds to a given sent test packet,
      then such a packet would have to be counted as lost.  It would be
      inconsistent to count packets with corrupted methodology-specific
      fields as lost, and not to count packets with other corrupted
      aspects in the same category.} Section 15 of [RFC2330] defines the
      "standard-formed" packet that is applicable to all metrics.  Note
      that at this time the definition of standard-formed packets only
      applies to IPv4 (see also [IPPM-UPDATES]).

   o  If the packet is duplicated along the path (or paths) so that
      multiple non-corrupt copies arrive at the destination, then the
      packet is counted as received.

   o  If the packet is fragmented and if, for whatever reason,
      reassembly does not occur, then the packet will be deemed lost.

2.6.  Methodologies

   As with other Type-P-* metrics, the detailed methodology will depend
   on the Type-P (e.g., protocol number, UDP/TCP port number, size,
   Differentiated Services (DS) Field [RFC2780]).

   Generally, for a given Type-P, one possible methodology would proceed
   as follows:

   o  Arrange that Src and Dst have clocks that are synchronized with
      each other.  The degree of synchronization is a parameter of the
      methodology and depends on the threshold used to determine loss
      (see below).

   o  At the Src host, select Src and Dst IP addresses and form a test
      packet of Type-P with these addresses.

   o  At the Dst host, arrange to receive the packet.

   o  At the Src host, place a timestamp in the prepared Type-P packet,
      and send it towards Dst (ideally minimizing time before sending).

   o  If the packet arrives within a reasonable period of time, the one-
      way packet loss is taken to be zero (and take a timestamp as soon
      as possible upon the receipt of the packet).

   o  If the packet fails to arrive within a reasonable period of time,
      Tmax, the one-way packet loss is taken to be one.  Note that the
      threshold of "reasonable" here is a parameter of the metric.

   {Comment: The definition of reasonable is intentionally vague and is
   intended to indicate a value "Th" so large that any value in the
   closed interval [Th-delta, Th+delta] is an equivalent threshold for
   loss.  Here, delta encompasses all error in clock synchronization and
   timestamp acquisition and assignment along the measured path.  If
   there is a single value, Tmax, after which the packet must be counted
   as lost, then we reintroduce the need for a degree of clock
   synchronization similar to that needed for one-way delay, and
   virtually all practical measurement systems combine methods for delay
   and loss.  Therefore, if a measure of packet loss parameterized by a
   specific non-huge "reasonable" time-out value is needed, one can
   always measure one-way delay and see what percentage of packets from
   a given stream exceed a given time-out value.  This point is examined
   in detail in [RFC6703], including analysis preferences to assign
   undefined delay to packets that fail to arrive with the difficulties
   emerging from the informal "infinite delay" assignment, and an
   estimation of an upper bound on waiting time for packets in transit.
   Further, enforcing a specific constant waiting time on stored

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   singletons of one-way delay is compliant with this specification and
   may allow the results to serve more than one reporting audience.}

   Issues such as the packet format, the means by which Dst knows when
   to expect the test packet, and the means by which Src and Dst are
   synchronized are outside the scope of this document. {Comment: We
   plan to document the implementation techniques of our work in much
   more detail elsewhere; we encourage others to do so as well.}

2.7.  Errors and Uncertainties

   The description of any specific measurement method should include an
   accounting and analysis of various sources of error or uncertainty.
   The Framework document provides general guidance on this point.

   For loss, there are three sources of error:

   o  synchronization between clocks on Src and Dst.

   o  the packet-loss threshold (which is related to the synchronization
      between clocks).

   o  resource limits in the network interface or software on the
      receiving instrument.

   The first two sources are interrelated and could result in a test
   packet with finite delay being reported as lost.  Type-P-One-way-
   Packet-Loss is 1 if the test packet does not arrive, or if it does
   arrive and the difference between the Src timestamp and the Dst
   timestamp is greater than the "reasonable period of time" or loss
   threshold.  If the clocks are not sufficiently synchronized, the loss
   threshold may not be "reasonable" - the packet may take much less
   time to arrive than its Src timestamp indicates.  Similarly, if the
   loss threshold is set too low, then many packets may be counted as
   lost.  The loss threshold must be high enough and the clocks
   synchronized well enough so that a packet that arrives is rarely
   counted as lost.  (See the discussions in the previous two sections.)

   Since the sensitivity of packet-loss measurement alone to lack of
   clock synchronization is less than for delay, we refer the reader to
   the treatment of synchronization errors in the "One-way Delay Metric
   for IPPM" [RFC2330] for more details.

   The last source of error, resource limits, cause the packet to be
   dropped by the measurement instrument and counted as lost when in
   fact the network delivered the packet in reasonable time.

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   The measurement instruments should be calibrated such that the loss
   threshold is reasonable for application of the metrics and the clocks
   are synchronized enough so the loss threshold remains reasonable.

   In addition, the instruments should be checked to ensure that the
   possibility a packet arrives at the network interface but is lost due
   to congestion on the interface or to other resource exhaustion (e.g.,
   buffers) on the instrument is low.

2.8.  Reporting the Metric

   The calibration and context in which the metric is measured MUST be
   carefully considered and SHOULD always be reported along with metric
   results.  We now present four items to consider: Type-P of the test
   packets, the loss threshold, instrument calibration, and the path
   traversed by the test packets.  This list is not exhaustive; any
   additional information that could be useful in interpreting
   applications of the metrics should also be reported (see [RFC6703]
   for extensive discussion of reporting considerations for different
   audiences).

2.8.1.  Type-P

   As noted in Section 13 of the Framework document [RFC2330], the value
   of the metric may depend on the type of IP packets used to make the
   measurement, or "Type-P".  The value of Type-P-One-way-Delay could
   change if the protocol (UDP or TCP), port number, size, or
   arrangement for special treatment (e.g., IP DS Field [RFC2780],
   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168], or RSVP) changes.
   Additional packet distinctions identified in future extensions of the
   Type-P definition will apply.  The exact Type-P used to make the
   measurements MUST be accurately reported.

2.8.2.  Loss Threshold

   The threshold, Tmax, between a large finite delay and loss (or other
   methodology to distinguish between finite delay and loss) MUST be
   reported.

2.8.3.  Calibration Results

   The degree of synchronization between the Src and Dst clocks MUST be
   reported.  If possible, a test packet that arrives at the Dst network
   interface and is reported as lost due to resource exhaustion on Dst
   SHOULD be reported.

2.8.4.  Path

   Finally, the path traversed by the packet SHOULD be reported, if
   possible.  In general, it is impractical to know the precise path a
   given packet takes through the network.  The precise path may be
   known for certain Type-P on short or stable paths.  If Type-P
   includes the record route (or loose-source route) option in the IP
   header, and the path is short enough, and all routers* on the path
   support record (or loose-source) route, then the path will be
   precisely recorded.  This is impractical because the route must be
   short enough, many routers do not support (or are not configured for)
   record route, and use of this feature would often artificially worsen
   the performance observed by removing the packet from common-case
   processing.  However, partial information is still valuable context.
   For example, if a host can choose between two links* (and hence, two
   separate routes from Src to Dst), then the initial link used is
   valuable context. {Comment: Backbone path selection services come and
   go.  A historical example was Merit's NetNow setup, where a Src on
   one Network Access Point (NAP) can reach a Dst on another NAP by
   either of several different backbone networks.}

3.  A Definition for Samples of One-Way Packet Loss

   Given the singleton metric Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss, we now define
   one particular sample of such singletons.  The idea of the sample is
   to select a particular binding of the parameters Src, Dst, and Type-
   P, then define a sample of values of parameter T.  The means for
   defining the values of T is to select a beginning time T0, a final
   time Tf, and an average rate lambda, then define a pseudorandom
   Poisson process of rate lambda, whose values fall between T0 and Tf.
   The time interval between successive values of T will then average 1/
   lambda.

   Note that Poisson sampling is only one way of defining a sample.
   Poisson has the advantage of limiting bias, but other methods of
   sampling will be appropriate for different situations.  For example,
   a truncated Poisson distribution may be needed to avoid reactive
   network state changes during intervals of inactivity, see Section 4.6
   of [RFC7312].  Sometimes the goal is sampling with a known bias, and
   [RFC3432] describes a method for periodic sampling with random start
   times.

3.1.  Metric Name

   Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss-Poisson-Stream






Almes, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 12]

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


3.2.  Metric Parameters

   o  Src, the IP address of a host

   o  Dst, the IP address of a host

   o  T0, a time

   o  Tf, a time

   o  Tmax, a loss threshold waiting time

   o  lambda, a rate in reciprocal seconds

3.3.  Metric Units

   A sequence of pairs; the elements of each pair are:

   o  T, a time, and

   o  L, either a zero or a one.

   The values of T in the sequence are monotonic increasing.  Note that
   T would be a valid parameter to Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss and that L
   would be a valid value of Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss.

3.4.  Definition

   Given T0, Tf, and lambda, we compute a pseudorandom Poisson process
   beginning at or before T0, with average arrival rate lambda, and
   ending at or after Tf.  Those time values greater than or equal to T0
   and less than or equal to Tf are then selected.  At each of the
   selected times in this process, we obtain one value of Type-P-One-
   way-Delay.  The value of the sample is the sequence made up of the
   resulting <time, loss> pairs.  If there are no such pairs, the
   sequence is of length zero and the sample is said to be empty.

3.5.  Discussion

   The reader should be familiar with the in-depth discussion of Poisson
   sampling in the Framework document [RFC2330], which includes methods
   to compute and verify the pseudorandom Poisson process.

   We specifically do not constrain the value of lambda except to note
   the extremes.  If the rate is too large, then the measurement traffic
   will perturb the network and itself cause congestion.  If the rate is
   too small, then you might not capture interesting network behavior.
   {Comment: We expect to document our experiences with, and suggestions



Almes, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 13]

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   for, lambda elsewhere, culminating in a "Best Current Practice"
   document.}

   Since a pseudorandom number sequence is employed, the sequence of
   times, and hence the value of the sample, is not fully specified.
   Pseudorandom number generators of good quality will be needed to
   achieve the desired qualities.

   The sample is defined in terms of a Poisson process both to avoid the
   effects of self-synchronization and also capture a sample that is
   statistically as unbiased as possible.  The Poisson process is used
   to schedule the loss measurements.  The test packets will generally
   not arrive at Dst according to a Poisson distribution, since they are
   influenced by the network.  Time-slotted links described in
   Section 3.4 [RFC7312] can greatly modify the sample characteristics.
   The main concern is that unbiased packet streams with randomized
   inter-packet time intervals will be converted to some new
   distribution after encountering a time-slotted link, possibly with
   strong periodic characteristics instead.

   {Comment: there is, of course, no claim that real Internet traffic
   arrives according to a Poisson arrival process.

   It is important to note that, in contrast to this metric, loss ratios
   observed by transport connections do not reflect unbiased samples.
   For example, TCP transmissions both (1) occur in bursts, which can
   induce loss due to the burst volume that would not otherwise have
   been observed, and (2) adapt their transmission rate in an attempt to
   minimize the loss ratio observed by the connection.}

   All the singleton Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss metrics in the sequence
   will have the same values of Src, Dst, and Type-P.

   Note also that, given one sample that runs from T0 to Tf, and given
   new time values T0' and Tf' such that T0 <= T0' <= Tf' <= Tf, the
   subsequence of the given sample whose time values fall between T0'
   and Tf' are also a valid Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss-Poisson-Stream
   sample.

3.6.  Methodologies

   The methodologies follow directly from:

   o  the selection of specific times using the specified Poisson
      arrival process, and

   o  the methodologies discussion already given for the singleton Type-
      P-One-way-Packet-Loss metric.



Almes, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 14]

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   Care must be given to correctly handle out-of-order arrival of test
   packets; it is possible that the Src could send one test packet at
   TS[i], then send a second one (later) at TS[i+1] while the Dst could
   receive the second test packet at TR[i+1], and then receive the first
   one (later) at TR[i].  Metrics for reordering may be found in
   [RFC4737].

3.7.  Errors and Uncertainties

   In addition to sources of errors and uncertainties associated with
   methods employed to measure the singleton values that make up the
   sample, care must be given to analyze the accuracy of the Poisson
   arrival process of the wire times of the sending of the test packets.
   Problems with this process could be caused by several things,
   including problems with the pseudorandom number techniques used to
   generate the Poisson arrival process.  The Framework document shows
   how to use the Anderson-Darling test to verify the accuracy of the
   Poisson process over small time frames. {Comment: The goal is to
   ensure that the test packets are sent "close enough" to a Poisson
   schedule and avoid periodic behavior.}

3.8.  Reporting the Metric

   The calibration and context for the underlying singletons MUST be
   reported along with the stream (see "Reporting the Metric"
   (Section 2.8) for Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss).

4.  Some Statistics Definitions for One-Way Packet Loss

   Given the sample metric Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss-Poisson-Stream, we
   now offer several statistics of that sample.  These statistics are
   offered mostly to be illustrative of what could be done.  See
   [RFC6703] for additional discussion of statistics that are relevant
   to different audiences.

4.1.  Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss-Ratio

   Given a Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss-Poisson-Stream, the average of all
   the L values in the stream is the ratio of losses to total packets in
   the stream.  In addition, the Type-P-One-way-Packet-Loss-Ratio is
   undefined if the sample is empty.










Almes, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 15]

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   For example, suppose we take a sample and the results are as follows:

   Stream1 = <

   <T1, 0>

   <T2, 0>

   <T3, 1>

   <T4, 0>

   <T5, 0>

   >

   Then, the average of loss results would be 0.2, the loss ratio.

   Note that, since healthy Internet paths should be operating at loss
   ratios below 1% (particularly if high delay-bandwidth products are to
   be sustained), the sample sizes needed might be larger than one would
   like.  Thus, for example, if one wants to discriminate between
   various fractions of 1% over one-minute periods, then several hundred
   samples per minute might be needed.  This would result in larger
   values of lambda than one would ordinarily want.

   Note that although the loss threshold should be set such that any
   errors in loss are not significant, if the possibility that a packet
   that arrived is counted as lost due to resource exhaustion is
   significant compared to the loss ratio of interest, Type-P-One-way-
   Packet-Loss-Ratio will be meaningless.

5.  Security Considerations

   Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy
   concerns.  This memo does not specify an implementation of the
   metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet
   nor of applications that run on the Internet.  However,
   implementations of these metrics must be mindful of security and
   privacy concerns.

   There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by
   the measurements and potential harm to the measurements.  The
   measurements could cause harm because they are active and inject
   packets into the network.  The measurement parameters MUST be
   carefully selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of
   additional traffic into the networks they measure.  If they inject




Almes, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 16]

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement and
   in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service.

   The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic or by
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic.  If routers can
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic.  If an attacker
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss
   ratio will be artificially lowered.  Therefore, the measurement
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the
   probability that measurement traffic can be distinguished from
   "normal" traffic.  Authentication techniques, such as digital
   signatures, may be used where appropriate to guard against injected
   traffic attacks.

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
   potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
   that are within this scope of work.  Passive observations of user
   traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.  We refer
   the reader to the privacy considerations described in the Large Scale
   Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework [RFC7594],
   which covers active and passive techniques.

   Collecting measurements or using measurement results for
   reconnaissance to assist in subsequent system attacks is quite
   common.  Access to measurement results or control of the measurement
   systems to perform reconnaissance should be guarded against.  See
   Section 7 of [RFC7594] (the Security Considerations section of the
   LMAP Framework) for system requirements that help to avoid
   measurement system compromise.

6.  Changes from RFC 2680

   The text above constitutes a revision to RFC 2680, which is now an
   Internet Standard.

   [RFC7290] provides the test plan and results supporting [RFC2680]
   advancement along the Standards Track, according to the process in
   [RFC6576].  The conclusions of [RFC7290] list four minor
   modifications for inclusion:

   1.  Section 6.2.3 of [RFC7290] asserts that the assumption of post-
       processing to enforce a constant waiting time threshold is
       compliant and that the text of the RFC should be revised slightly
       to include this point.  The applicability of post-processing was
       added in the last list item of Section 2.6, above.



Almes, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 17]

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   2.  Section 6.5 of [RFC7290] indicates that the Type-P-One-way-
       Packet-Loss-Average statistic is more commonly called a Packet
       Loss Ratio, so it is renamed in this document (this small
       discrepancy does not affect candidacy for advancement).  The
       renaming was implemented in Section 4.1, above.

   3.  The IETF has reached consensus on guidance for reporting metrics
       in [RFC6703], and the memo is referenced this document to
       incorporate recent experience where appropriate.  This reference
       was added in the last list item of Section 2.6, in Section 2.8,
       and in Section 4 above.

   4.  There are currently two errata with status "Verified" (EID 1528)
       and "Held for Document Update" (EID 3186) for [RFC2680], and
       these minor revisions were incorporated in Sections 1 and 2.7.

   A number of updates to the [RFC2680] text have been implemented in
   the text to reference key IPPM RFCs that were approved after
   [RFC2680] (see Sections 3 and 3.6, above) and to address comments on
   the IPPM mailing list describing current conditions and experience.

   1.   Near the end of Section 1.1, there is an update of a network
        example using ATM, a clarification of TCP's affect on queue
        occupation, and discussion of the importance of one-way delay
        measurement.

   2.   Clarification of the definition of "resolution" in Section 1.2.

   3.   Explicit inclusion of the maximum waiting time input parameter
        in Sections 2.2, 2.4, and 3.2, reflecting recognition of this
        parameter in more recent RFCs and ITU-T Recommendation Y.1540.

   4.   Addition of a reference to RFC 6703 in the discussion of packet
        lifetime and application timeouts in Section 2.5.

   5.   Replaced "precedence" with updated terminology (DS Field) in
        Sections 2.6 and 2.8.1 (with reference).

   6.   Added parenthetical guidance on minimizing the interval between
        timestamp placement to send time or reception time in
        Section 2.6.  Also, the text now recognizes the timestamp
        acquisition process and that practical systems measure both
        delay and loss (thus requiring the max waiting time parameter).

   7.   Added a reference to RFC 3432 regarding periodic sampling
        alongside Poisson sampling in Section 3 and also noted that a
        truncated Poisson distribution may be needed with modern
        networks as described in the IPPM Framework update [RFC7312].



Almes, et al.                Standards Track                   [Page 18]

RFC 7680             A One-Way Loss Metric for IPPM         January 2016


   8.   Recognition that time-slotted links described in [RFC7312] can
        greatly modify the sample characteristics, in Section 3.5.

   9.   Added a reference to RFC 4737 regarding reordering metrics in
        the related discussion of Section 3.6, "Methodologies".

   10.  Expanded and updated the material on privacy and added cautions
        on use of measurements for reconnaissance in Section 5,
        "Security Considerations".

   Section 5.4.4 of [RFC6390] suggests a common template for performance
   metrics partially derived from previous IPPM and Benchmarking
   Methodology Working Group (BMWG) RFCs, but it also contains some new
   items.  All of the normative parts of [RFC6390] are covered, but not
   quite in the same section names or orientation.  Several of the
   informative parts are covered.  Maintaining the familiar outline of
   IPPM literature has value and minimizes unnecessary differences
   between this revised RFC and current/future IPPM RFCs.
