       Moving Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) IANA Registries
                           to a New Registry

Abstract

   RFC 5586 generalized the applicability of the pseudowire Associated
   Channel Header (PW-ACH) into the Generic Associated Channel G-ACh.
   However, registries and allocations of G-ACh parameters had been
   distributed throughout different, sometimes unrelated, registries.
   This document coalesces these into a new "Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Parameters" registry under the "Multiprotocol Label Switching
   Architecture (MPLS)" heading.  This document updates RFC 5586.

   This document also updates RFCs 6374, 6378, 6427, and 6428.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 5586 generalized the PW-ACH into the G-ACh.  However, registries
   and allocations of G-ACh namespaces had been distributed throughout
   different registries.  This document coalesces these into a new
   "Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters" registry in the
   "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)" name space.  This
   reorganization achieves two purposes: it allocates the G-ACh
   registries in their natural place in the MPLS names space, and it
   provides a single view of the G-ACh registries, to simplify future
   assignments and avoid potential conflicts.  This is an update to RFC
   5586 [RFC5586].

RFC 7214                Creating G-ACh registries               May 2014


   Further, the "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" registry is
   renamed to "Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) Types (including
   Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)" to make its generalized status
   explicit, and it is moved into the newly created registry.

   Additionally, RFC 6374 [RFC6374], RFC 6378 [RFC6378], RFC 6427
   [RFC6427], and RFC 6428 [RFC6428] specify allocations within the
   G-ACh that are now moved into the new registry.

   With respect to where to find these IANA registries, the RFCs listed
   above are updated as indicated in Section 3; however, the registries
   themselves are not changed (with the exception of one being renamed).
   They are moved unchanged to the new registry.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added this document as a reference for each registry that
   has been moved or renamed as a result of actions requested by this
   document.

   IANA has replaced all the relocated registries with pointers to the
   new URL or with a redirect.

2.1.  Creation of a New Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Parameters
      IANA Registry

   IANA has created a new "Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)
   Parameters" registry.  This is the common registry that will include
   all the registries being moved in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.

2.2.  Renaming and Moving the Pseudowire Associated Channel Types
      Registry

   This document renames the "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types"
   registry [IANA-PWE3] to "MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh)
   Types (including Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)".  This
   registry has been moved and included in the "Generic Associated
   Channel (G-ACh) Parameters" registry created in Section 2.1 because
   any additional registries are dependent upon the Associated Channel
   Header Type.

   At the time of publishing this document and moving the registry, the
   following RFCs have G-ACh Types allocated: [RFC4385], [RFC5586],
   [RFC5718], [RFC5885], [RFC6374], [RFC6378], [RFC6426], [RFC6427],
   [RFC6428], [RFC6435], [RFC6478], and [RFC6671].

2.3.  Consolidating G-ACh Registries

   This document further updates the following RFCs by moving the
   registries related to G-ACh to the common "Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Parameters" registry created in Section 2.1.

   o  From the PWE Parameters Registry [IANA-PWE3]:

      *  MPLS Generalized Associated Channel (G-ACh) Types [RFC5586]

      *  CC/CV MEP-ID TLV Registry [RFC6428]

   o  From the MPLS LSP Ping Parameters Registry [IANA-LSP-Ping]:

      *  Measurement Timestamp Type [RFC6374]

      *  Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code: Query Codes [RFC6374]

      *  Loss/Delay Measurement Control Code: Response Codes [RFC6374]

      *  MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object [RFC6374]

   o  From the MPLS OAM Parameters Registry [IANA-MPLS-OAM]:

      *  MPLS Fault OAM Message Type Registry [RFC6427]

      *  MPLS Fault OAM Flag Registry [RFC6427]

      *  MPLS Fault OAM TLV Registry [RFC6427]

      *  MPLS PSC Request Registry [RFC6378]

      *  MPLS PSC TLV Registry [RFC6378]

      Note that all the sub-registries in [IANA-MPLS-OAM] have been
      removed from "Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Operations,
      Administration, and Management (OAM) Parameters" registry.
      Therefore, the IANA has removed the MPLS OAM registry, per this
      document.

3.  RFC Updates

   This document updates [RFC5586] renaming the "Pseudowire Associated
   Channel Types" [IANA-PWE3] to "MPLS Generalized Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Types (including Pseudowire Associated Channel Types)".

RFC 7214                Creating G-ACh registries               May 2014


   This document also updates the following RFCs by moving the G-ACh
   related registries to a common "MPLS Generic Associated Channel
   (G-ACh) Parameters" registry: RFCs 6374, 6378, 6427, and 6428.

   All the registries listed above are moved without any changes to
   their content.  The reason to move them is to create on single place
   where it is possible to find all the G-ACh parameters.

4.  Security Considerations

   The IANA instructions in this document do not directly introduce any
   new security issues.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors want to thank Amanda Baber and Scott Bradner for review
   and valuable comments.
