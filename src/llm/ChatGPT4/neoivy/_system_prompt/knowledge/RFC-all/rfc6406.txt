RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a reference peering architecture for the
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261], it's functional
   components and interfaces in the context of session peering for
   multimedia interconnects.  In this process, we define the peering
   reference architecture and its functional components, and peering
   interface functions from the perspective of a SIP Service Provider's
   (SSP's) [RFC5486] network.  Thus, it also describes the components
   and the steps necessary to establish a session between two SSP
   peering domains.

   An SSP may also be referred to as an Internet Telephony Service
   Provider (ITSP).  While the terms ITSP and SSP are frequently used
   interchangeably, this document and other subsequent SIP peering-
   related documents should use the term SSP.  SSP more accurately
   depicts the use of SIP as the underlying Layer 5 signaling protocol.

   This architecture enables the interconnection of two SSPs in Layer 5
   peering, as defined in the SIP-based session peering requirements
   [RFC6271].

   Layer 3 peering is outside the scope of this document.  Hence, the
   figures in this document do not show routers so that the focus is on
   Layer 5 protocol aspects.

   This document uses terminology defined in "Session Peering for
   Multimedia Interconnect (SPEERMINT) Terminology" [RFC5486].  In
   addition to normative references included herein, readers may also
   find [RFC6405] informative.

2.  New Terminology

   [RFC5486] is a key reference for the majority of the SPEERMINT-
   related terminology used in this document.  However, some additional
   new terms are used here as follows in this section.

2.1.  Session Border Controller (SBC)

   A Session Border Controller (SBC) is referred to in Section 5.  An
   SBC can contain a Signaling Function (SF), Signaling Path Border
   Element (SBE) and Data Path Border Element (DBE), and may perform the
   Lookup Function (LUF) and Location Routing Function (LRF), as
   described in Section 3.  Whether the SBC performs one or more of
   these functions is, generally speaking, dependent upon how a SIP
   Service Provider (SSP) configures such a network element.  In
   addition, requirements for an SBC can be found in [RFC5853].

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


2.2.  Carrier-of-Record

   A carrier-of-record, as used in Section 6.1.2.2, is defined in
   [RFC5067].  That document describes the term as referring to the
   entity having discretion over the domain and zone content and acting
   as the registrant for a telephone number, as represented in ENUM.
   This can be as follows:

   o  the service provider to which the E.164 number was allocated for
      end user assignment, whether by the National Regulatory Authority
      (NRA) or the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), for
      instance, a code under "International Networks" (+882) or
      "Universal Personal Telecommunications (UPT)" (+878), or

   o  if the number is ported, the service provider to which the number
      was ported, or

   o  where numbers are assigned directly to end users, the service
      provider that the end user number assignee has chosen to provide a
      Public Switched Telephone Network / Public Land Mobile Network
      (PSTN/PLMN) point-of-interconnect for the number.

   It is understood that the definition of "carrier-of-record" within a
   given jurisdiction is subject to modification by national
   authorities.

3.  Reference Architecture

   The following figure depicts the architecture and logical functions
   that form peering between two SSPs.

   For further details on the elements and functions described in this
   figure, please refer to [RFC5486].  The following terms, which appear
   in Figure 1 and are documented in [RFC5486], are reproduced here for
   simplicity.

   o  Data Path Border Element (DBE): A data path border element (DBE)
      is located on the administrative border of a domain through which
      the media associated with an inter-domain session flows.
      Typically, it provides media-related functions such as deep packet
      inspection and modification, media relay, and firewall-traversal
      support.  The DBE may be controlled by the SBE.

   o  E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM): See [RFC6116].

   o  Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): See [RFC1035].

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


   o  Location Routing Function (LRF): The Location Routing Function
      (LRF) determines, for the target domain of a given request, the
      location of the SF in that domain, and optionally develops other
      Session Establishment Data (SED) required to route the request to
      that domain.  An example of the LRF may be applied to either
      example in Section 4.3.3 of [RFC5486].  Once the ENUM response or
      SIP 302 redirect is received with the destination's SIP URI, the
      LRF must derive the destination peer's SF from the FQDN in the
      domain portion of the URI.  In some cases, some entity (usually a
      third party or federation) provides peering assistance to the
      Originating SSP by providing this function.  The assisting entity
      may provide information relating to direct (Section 4.2.1 of
      [RFC5486]) or indirect (Section 4.2.2 of [RFC5486]) peering as
      necessary.

   o  Lookup Function (LUF): The Lookup Function (LUF) determines, for a
      given request, the target domain to which the request should be
      routed.  An example of an LUF is an ENUM [4] look-up or a SIP
      INVITE request to a SIP proxy providing redirect responses for
      peers.  In some cases, some entity (usually a third party or
      federation) provides peering assistance to the Originating SSP by
      providing this function.  The assisting entity may provide
      information relating to direct (Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5486]) or
      indirect (Section 4.2.2 of [RFC5486]) peering as necessary.

   o  Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP): See [RFC3550].

   o  Session Initiation Protocol (SIP): See [RFC3261].

   o  Signaling Path Border Element (SBE): A signaling path border
      element (SBE) is located on the administrative border of a domain
      through which inter-domain session-layer messages will flow.
      Typically, it provides Signaling Functions such as protocol inter-
      working (for example, H.323 to SIP), identity and topology hiding,
      and Session Admission Control for a domain.

   o  Signaling Function (SF): The Signaling Function (SF) performs
      routing of SIP requests for establishing and maintaining calls and
      in order to assist in the discovery or exchange of parameters to
      be used by the Media Function (MF).  The SF is a capability of SIP
      processing elements such as SIP proxies, SBEs, and User Agents.

   o  SIP Service Provider (SSP): A SIP Service Provider (SSP) is an
      entity that provides session services utilizing SIP signaling to
      its customers.  In the event that the SSP is also a function of
      the SP, it may also provide media streams to its customers.  Such
      an SSP may additionally be peered with other SSPs.  An SSP may
      also interconnect with the PSTN.

4.  Procedures of Inter-Domain SSP Session Establishment

   This document assumes that in order for a session to be established
   from a User Agent (UA) in the Originating (or Indirect) SSP's network
   to a UA in the Target SSP's network the following steps are taken:

   1.  Determine the Target or Indirect SSP via the LUF.  (Note: If the
       target address represents an intra-SSP resource, the behavior is
       out of scope with respect to this document.)

   2.  Determine the address of the SF of the Target SSP via the LRF.

   3.  Establish the session.

   4.  Exchange the media, which could include voice, video, text, etc.

   5.  End the session (BYE)

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


   The Originating or Indirect SSP would perform steps 1-4, the Target
   SSP would perform step 4, and either one can perform step 5.

   In the case that the Target SSP changes, steps 1-4 would be repeated.
   This is reflected in Figure 1, which shows the Target SSP with its
   own peering functions.

5.  Relationships between Functions/Elements

   Please also refer to Figure 1.

   o  An SBE can contain a Signaling Function (SF).

   o  An SF can perform a Lookup Function (LUF) and Location Routing
      Function (LRF).

   o  As an additional consideration, a Session Border Controller, can
      contain an SF, SBE and DBE, and may act as both an LUF and LRF.

   o  The following functions may communicate as follows in an example
      SSP network, depending upon various real-world implementations:

      *  SF may communicate with the LUF, LRF, SBE, and SF

      *  LUF may communicate with the SF and SBE

      *  LRF may communicate with the SF and SBE

6.  Recommended SSP Procedures

   This section describes the functions in more detail and provides some
   recommendations on the role they would play in a SIP call in a Layer
   5 peering scenario.

   Some of the information in this section is taken from [RFC6271] and
   is included here for continuity purposes.  It is also important to
   refer to Section 3.2 of [RFC6404], particularly with respect to the
   use of IPsec and TLS.

6.1.  Originating or Indirect SSP Procedures

   This section describes the procedures of the Originating or indirect
   SSP.

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


6.1.1.  The Lookup Function (LUF)

   The purpose of the LUF is to determine the SF of the target domain of
   a given request and optionally to develop Session Establishment Data.
   It is important to note that the LUF may utilize the public e164.arpa
   ENUM root, as well as one or more private roots.  When private roots
   are used, specialized routing rules may be implemented; these rules
   may vary depending upon whether an Originating or Indirect SSP is
   querying the LUF.

6.1.1.1.  Target Address Analysis

   When the Originating (or Indirect) SSP receives a request to
   communicate, it analyzes the target URI to determine whether the call
   needs to be routed internally or externally to its network.  The
   analysis method is internal to the SSP; thus, outside the scope of
   SPEERMINT.

   If the target address does not represent a resource inside the
   Originating (or Indirect) SSP's administrative domain or federation
   of domains, then the Originating (or Indirect) SSP performs a Lookup
   Function (LUF) to determine a target address, and then it resolves
   the call routing data by using the Location Routing Function (LRF).

   For example, if the request to communicate is for an im: or pres: URI
   type [RFC3861] [RFC3953], the Originating (or Indirect) SSP follows
   the procedures in [RFC3861].  If the highest priority supported URI
   scheme is sip: or sips:, the Originating (or Indirect) SSP skips to
   SIP DNS resolution in Section 5.1.3.  Likewise, if the target address
   is already a sip: or sips: URI in an external domain, the Originating
   (or Indirect) SSP skips to SIP DNS resolution in Section 6.1.2.1.
   This may be the case, to use one example, with
   "sips:bob@biloxi.example.com".

   If the target address corresponds to a specific E.164 address, the
   SSP may need to perform some form of number plan mapping according to
   local policy.  For example, in the United States, a dial string
   beginning "011 44" could be converted to "+44"; in the United
   Kingdom, "00 1" could be converted to "+1".  Once the SSP has an
   E.164 address, it can use ENUM.

6.1.1.2.  ENUM Lookup

   If an external E.164 address is the target, the Originating (or
   Indirect) SSP consults the public "User ENUM" rooted at e164.arpa,
   according to the procedures described in [RFC6116].  The SSP must
   query for the "E2U+sip" enumservice as described in [RFC3764], but
   may check for other enumservices.  The Originating (or Indirect) SSP



Malas & Livingood             Informational                     [Page 8]

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


   may consult a cache or alternate representation of the ENUM data
   rather than actual DNS queries.  Also, the SSP may skip actual DNS
   queries if the Originating (or Indirect) SSP is sure that the target
   address country code is not represented in e164.arpa.

   If an im: or pres: URI is chosen based on an "E2U+im" [RFC3861] or
   "E2U+pres" [RFC3953] enumserver, the SSP follows the procedures for
   resolving these URIs to URIs for specific protocols such as SIP or
   Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) as described in the
   previous section.

   The Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) response to the ENUM lookup may
   be a SIP address of record (AOR) (such as "sips:bob@example.com") or
   SIP URI (such as "sips:bob@sbe1.biloxi.example.com").  In the case
   when a SIP URI is returned, the Originating (or Indirect) SSP has
   sufficient routing information to locate the Target SSP.  In the case
   of when a SIP AoR is returned, the SF then uses the LRF to determine
   the URI for more explicitly locating the Target SSP.

6.1.2.  Location Routing Function (LRF)

   The LRF of an Originating (or Indirect) SSP analyzes target address
   and target domain identified by the LUF, and discovers the next-hop
   Signaling Function (SF) in a peering relationship.  The resource to
   determine the SF of the target domain might be provided by a third
   party as in the assisted-peering case.  The following sections define
   mechanisms that may be used by the LRF.  These are not in any
   particular order and, importantly, not all of them have to be used.

6.1.2.1.  DNS Resolution

   The Originating (or Indirect) SSP uses the procedures in Section 4 of
   [RFC3263] to determine how to contact the receiving SSP.  To
   summarize the [RFC3263] procedure: unless these are explicitly
   encoded in the target URI, a transport is chosen using NAPTR records,
   a port is chosen using SRV records, and an address is chosen using A
   or AAAA records.

   When communicating with another SSP, entities compliant to this
   document should select a TLS-protected transport for communication
   from the Originating (or Indirect) SSP to the receiving SSP if
   available, as described further in Section 6.2.1.

6.1.2.2.  Routing Table

   If there are no End User ENUM records and the Originating (or
   Indirect) SSP cannot discover the carrier-of-record or if the
   Originating (or Indirect) SSP cannot reach the carrier-of-record via



Malas & Livingood             Informational                     [Page 9]

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


   SIP peering, the Originating (or Indirect) SSP may deliver the call
   to the PSTN or reject it.  Note that the Originating (or Indirect)
   SSP may forward the call to another SSP for PSTN gateway termination
   by prior arrangement using the local SIP proxy routing table.

   If so, the Originating (or Indirect) SSP rewrites the Request-URI to
   address the gateway resource in the Target SSP's domain and may
   forward the request on to that SSP using the procedures described in
   the remainder of these steps.

6.1.2.3.  LRF to LRF Routing

   Communications between the LRF of two interconnecting SSPs may use
   DNS or statically provisioned IP addresses for reachability.  Other
   inputs to determine the path may be code-based routing, method-based
   routing, time of day, least cost and/or source-based routing.

6.1.3.  The Signaling Path Border Element (SBE)

   The purpose of the Signaling Function is to perform routing of SIP
   messages as well as optionally implement security and policies on SIP
   messages and to assist in discovery/exchange of parameters to be used
   by the Media Function (MF).  The Signaling Function performs the
   routing of SIP messages.  The SBE may be a back-to-back user agent
   (B2BUA) or it may act as a SIP proxy.  Optionally, an SF may perform
   additional functions such as Session Admission Control, SIP Denial-
   of-Service protection, SIP Topology Hiding, SIP header normalization,
   SIP security, privacy, and encryption.  The SF of an SBE can also
   process SDP payloads for media information such as media type,
   bandwidth, and type of codec; then, communicate this information to
   the media function.

6.1.3.1.  Establishing a Trusted Relationship

   Depending on the security needs and trust relationships between SSPs,
   different security mechanisms can be used to establish SIP calls.
   These are discussed in the following subsections.

6.1.3.2.  IPsec

   In certain deployments, the use of IPsec between the Signaling
   Functions of the originating and terminating domains can be used as a
   security mechanism instead of TLS.  However, such IPsec use should be
   the subject of a future document as additional specification is
   necessary to use IPsec properly and effectively.

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


6.1.3.3.  Co-Location

   In this scenario, the SFs are co-located in a physically secure
   location and/or are members of a segregated network.  In this case,
   messages between the Originating and Terminating SSPs could be sent
   as clear text (unencrypted).  However, even in these semi-trusted co-
   location facilities, other security or access control mechanisms may
   be appropriate, such as IP access control lists or other mechanisms.

6.1.3.4.  Sending the SIP Request

   Once a trust relationship between the peers is established, the
   Originating (or Indirect) SSP sends the request.

6.2.  Target SSP Procedures

   This section describes the Target SSP Procedures.

6.2.1.  TLS

   The section defines the usage of TLS between two SSPs [RFC5246]
   [RFC5746] [RFC5878].  When the receiving SSP receives a TLS client
   hello, it responds with its certificate.  The Target SSP certificate
   should be valid and rooted in a well-known certificate authority.
   The procedures to authenticate the SSP's originating domain are
   specified in [RFC5922].

   The SF of the Target SSP verifies that the Identity header is valid,
   corresponds to the message, corresponds to the Identity-Info header,
   and that the domain in the From header corresponds to one of the
   domains in the TLS client certificate.

   As noted above in Section 6.1.3.2, some deployments may utilize IPsec
   rather than TLS.

6.2.2.  Receive SIP Requests

   Once a trust relationship is established, the Target SSP is prepared
   to receive incoming SIP requests.  For new requests (dialog forming
   or not), the receiving SSP verifies if the target (Request-URI) is a
   domain for which it is responsible.  For these requests, there should
   be no remaining Route header field values.  For in-dialog requests,
   the receiving SSP can verify that it corresponds to the top-most
   Route header field value.

RFC 6406             SPEERMINT Peering Architecture        November 2011


   The receiving SSP may reject incoming requests due to local policy.
   When a request is rejected because the Originating (or Indirect) SSP
   is not authorized to peer, the receiving SSP should respond with a
   403 response with the reason phrase "Unsupported Peer".

6.3.  Data Path Border Element (DBE)

   The purpose of the DBE [RFC5486] is to perform media-related
   functions such as media transcoding and media security implementation
   between two SSPs.

   An example of this is to transform a voice payload from one codec
   (e.g., G.711) to another (e.g., EvRC).  Additionally, the MF may
   perform media relaying, media security [RFC3711], privacy, and
   encryption.

7.  Address Space Considerations

   Peering must occur in a common IP address space, which is defined by
   the federation, which may be entirely on the public Internet, or some
   private address space [RFC1918].  The origination or termination
   networks may or may not entirely be in the same address space.  If
   they are not, then a Network Address Translation (NAT) or similar may
   be needed before the signaling or media is presented correctly to the
   federation.  The only requirement is that all associated entities
   across the peering interface are reachable.

8.  Acknowledgments

   The working group would like to thank John Elwell, Otmar Lendl, Rohan
   Mahy, Alexander Mayrhofer, Jim McEachern, Jean-Francois Mule,
   Jonathan Rosenberg, and Dan Wing for their valuable contributions to
   various versions of this document.

9.  Security Considerations

   The level (or types) of security mechanisms implemented between
   peering providers is, in practice, dependent upon on the underlying
   physical security of SSP connections.  This means, as noted in
   Section 6.1.3.3, whether peering equipment is in a secure facility or
   not may bear on other types of security mechanisms that may be
   appropriate.  Thus, if two SSPs peered across public Internet links,
   they are likely to use IPsec or TLS since the link between the two
   domains should be considered untrusted.

   Many detailed and highly relevant security requirements for SPEERMINT
   have been documented in Section 5 of [RFC6271].  As a result, that
   document should be considered required reading.

   Additional and important security considerations have been documented
   separately in [RFC6404].  This document describes the many relevant
   security threats to SPEERMINT, as well the relevant countermeasures
   and security protections that are recommended to combat any potential
   threats or other risks.  This includes a wide range of detailed
   threats in Section 2 of [RFC6404].  It also includes key requirements
   in Section 3.1 of [RFC6404], such as the requirement for the LUF and
   LRF to support mutual authentication for queries, among other
   requirements which are related to [RFC6271].  Section 3.2 of
   [RFC6404] explains how to meet these security requirements, and then
   Section 4 explores a wide range of suggested countermeasures.
