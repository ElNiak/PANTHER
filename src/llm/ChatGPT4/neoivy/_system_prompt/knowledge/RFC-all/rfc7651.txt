               3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystems (IMS) Option
        for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)

Abstract

   This document defines two new configuration attributes for the
   Internet Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2).  These attributes
   can be used for carrying the IPv4 address and IPv6 address of the
   Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF).  When an IPsec gateway
   delivers these attributes to an IPsec client, the IPsec client can
   obtain the IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server located in
   the 3GPP network.

1.  Introduction

   The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) S2b reference point
   [TS23402], specified by the 3GPP system architecture, defines a
   mechanism for allowing a mobile node (MN) attached in an untrusted,
   non-3GPP IP access network to securely connect to a 3GPP network and
   access IP services.  In this scenario, the mobile node establishes an
   IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) tunnel [RFC4303]  to the
   security gateway called the Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) that
   in turn establishes a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] or GPRS
   Tunneling Protocol (GTP) [TS23402] tunnel to the Packet Data Network
   Gateway (PGW) [TS23402] where the mobile node's session is anchored.

   The below figure shows the interworking option for non-3GPP access
   over an untrusted access network.  The Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)
   and the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) functions are defined in
   [RFC5213].  The ePDG and PGW functions are defined in [TS23402].  The
   IPsec ESP tunnel is used between the MN and the ePDG; either a PMIP
   or GTP tunnel is used between the ePDG and PGW.

           Figure 1: Exchange of IPv4 Traffic Offload Selectors

   A mobile node in this scenario may potentially need to access the IP
   Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) services in the 3GPP network.  The 3GPP
   IMS architecture is described in [TS23228] and [TS24229].  Currently,
   there are no attributes in IKEv2 [RFC7296] that can be used for
   carrying these information elements.  In the absence of these
   attributes, the mobile node needs to be statically configured with
   this information and this is proving to be an operational challenge.
   Any other approaches for discovering these functions (such as using
   DNS or DHCP) would result in obtaining configuration from the access
   network and not from the home network.  Given that the above
   referenced 3GPP interface is primarily for allowing the mobile node
   to connect to the 3GPP network through an untrusted access network,
   the access network may not have any relation with the home network
   provider and may be unable to deliver the mobile node's home network
   configuration.

   This specification therefore defines two new IKEv2 attributes
   [RFC7296] that allow an IPsec gateway to provide the IPv4 and/or IPv6
   address of the P-CSCF server.  These attributes can be exchanged by
   IKEv2 peers as part of the configuration payload exchange.  The
   attributes follow the configuration attribute format defined in
   Section 3.15.1 of [RFC7296].  Furthermore, providing the P-CSCF
   server address(es) in IKEv2 as a standard attribute(s) enables
   clients to directly access IMS services behind a VPN gateway without
   going through the 3GPP-specific interfaces.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

2.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Terminology

   All the IKEv2-related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in [RFC7296] and [RFC5739].  All the mobility-
   related terms are to be interpreted as defined in [RFC5213] and
   [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the following terms:

   Proxy-Call Session Control Function (P-CSCF)

      The P-CSCF is the entry point to the 3GPP IMS and serves as the
      SIP outbound proxy for the mobile node.  The mobile node performs
      SIP registration to 3GPP IMS and initiates SIP sessions via a
      P-CSCF.

   Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG)

      This is a security gateway defined by the 3GPP system
      architecture.  The protocol interfaces it supports include IKEv2
      [RFC7296].

3.  P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS Configuration Attribute

   The P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS configuration attribute is formatted as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Attribute Type (15 bits)
      20

   Length (2 octets)
      Length of the IPv4 address field that follows.  Possible values
      are (0) and (4).  A value of (4) indicates the size of the 4-octet
      IPv4 address that follows.  A value of (0) indicates that it's an
      empty attribute with a zero-length IPv4 address field primarily
      used as a request indicator.

   IPv4 Address (4 octets)
      An IPv4 address of the P-CSCF server.

   The P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS configuration attribute provides an IPv4
   address of a P-CSCF server within the network.  If an instance of an
   empty P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attribute with a zero-length IPv4 Address
   field is included by the mobile node, the responder MAY respond with
   zero, one, or more P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attributes.  If several
   P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attributes are provided in one IKEv2 message,
   there is no implied order among the P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS attributes.
   However, a system architecture using this specification may be able
   to enforce some order at both the peers.

4.  P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS Configuration Attribute

   The P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS configuration attribute is formatted as
   follows:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Length (2 octets)
      Length of the IPv6 address field that follows.  Possible values
      are (0) and (16).  A value of (16) indicates the size of the
      16-octet IPv6 address that follows.  A value of (0) indicates that
      it's an empty attribute with a zero-length IPv6 address field
      primarily used as a request indicator.

   IPv6 Address (16 octets)
      An IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server.

   The P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS configuration attribute provides an IPv6
   address of a P-CSCF server within the network.  If an instance of an
   empty P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attribute with a zero-length IPv6 Address
   field is included by the mobile node, the responder MAY respond with
   zero, one, or more P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attributes.  If several
   P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attributes are provided in one IKEv2 message,
   there is no implied order among the P_CSCF_IP6_ADDRESS attributes.
   However, a system architecture using this specification may be able

5.  Example Scenario

   The mobile node MAY request the IP address of an P-CSCF server as
   shown below.

         Client      Gateway
        --------    ---------

         HDR(IKE_SA_INIT), SAi1, KEi, Ni  -->

                  <--  HDR(IKE_SA_INIT), SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ]

         HDR(IKE_AUTH),
         SK { IDi, CERT, [CERTREQ], AUTH, [IDr],
              CP(CFG_REQUEST) =
                 { INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS(),
                   INTERNAL_IP4_DNS(),
                   P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS() }, SAi2,
              TSi = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255),
              TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255) }  -->

                     SK { IDr, CERT, AUTH,
                          CP(CFG_REPLY) =
                             { INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS(192.0.2.234),
                               P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS(192.0.2.1),
                               P_CSCF_IP4_ADDRESS(192.0.2.4),
                               INTERNAL_IP4_DNS(198.51.100.33) },
                          SAr2,
                          TSi = (0, 0-65535, 192.0.2.234-192.0.2.234),
                          TSr = (0, 0-65535, 0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255) }

6.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, the following IANA actions have been completed.

   o  Action 1: This specification defines a new IKEv2 attribute for
      carrying the IPv4 address of the P-CSCF server.  This attribute is
      defined in Section 3.  It has been assigned value 20 from the
      "IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types" namespace defined in
      [RFC7296].

RFC 7651                3GPP IMS Option for IKEv2         September 2015


   o  Action 2: This specification defines a new IKEv2 attribute for
      carrying the IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server.  This attribute is
      defined in Section 4.  It has been assigned value 21 from the
      "IKEv2 Configuration Payload Attribute Types" namespace defined in
      [RFC7296].

7.  Security Considerations

   This document is an extension to IKEv2 [RFC7296] and therefore it
   inherits all the security properties of IKEv2.

   The two new IKEv2 attributes defined in this specification are for
   carrying the IPv4 and IPv6 address of the P-CSCF server.  These
   attributes can be exchanged by IKE peers as part of the configuration
   payload, and the currently defined IKEv2 security framework provides
   the needed integrity and privacy protection for these attributes.
   Therefore, this specification does not introduce any new security
   vulnerabilities.
