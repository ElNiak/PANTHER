                    TFTP Option Negotiation Analysis

Abstract

   The TFTP option negotiation mechanism, proposed in [1], is a
   backward-compatible extension to the TFTP protocol, defined in [2].
   It allows file transfer options to be negotiated prior to the
   transfer using a mechanism which is consistent with TFTP's Request
   Packet format.  The mechanism is kept simple by enforcing a request-
   respond-acknowledge sequence, similar to the lock-step approach taken
   by TFTP itself.

   This document was written to allay concerns that the presence of
   options in a TFTP Request packet might cause pathological behavior on
   servers which do not support TFTP option negotiation.

Test Results

   A TFTP client, modified to send TFTP options, was tested against five
   unmodified servers:

      DEC   DEC 3000/400 alpha   OSF1 V3.0
      SGI   IP17 mips            IRIX 5.2
      SUN   sun4c sparc          SunOS 5.1
      IBM   RS/6000 Model 320    AIX 3.4
      SUN   sun4m                SunOS 4.1.3

   In each case, the servers ignored the option information in the
   Request packet and the transfer proceeded as though no option
   negotiation had been attempted.  In addition, the standard BSD4.3
   source for TFTPD, the starting point for many implementations, was
   examined.  The code clearly ignores any extraneous information in
   Request packets.

   From these results and examinations, it is clear that the TFTP option

   negotiation mechanism is fully backward-compatible with unmodified
   TFTP servers.

Security Considerations

   Security issues are not discussed in this memo.
