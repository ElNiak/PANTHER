  Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Origin Validation for BGP
                                 Export

Abstract

   A BGP speaker may perform Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
   origin validation not only on routes received from BGP neighbors and
   routes that are redistributed from other routing protocols, but also
   on routes it sends to BGP neighbors.  For egress policy, it is
   important that the classification use the 'effective origin AS' of
   the processed route, which may specifically be altered by the
   commonly available knobs, such as removing private ASes,
   confederation handling, and other modifications of the origin AS.
   This document updates RFC 6811.

1.  Introduction

   This document does not change the protocol or semantics of [RFC6811],
   BGP prefix origin validation.  It highlights an important use case of
   origin validation in external BGP (eBGP) egress policies, explaining
   specifics of correct implementation in this context.

   The term 'effective origin AS' as used in this document refers to the
   Route Origin Autonomous System Number (ASN) [RFC6811] of the UPDATE
   to be sent to neighboring BGP speakers.

   The effective origin AS of a BGP UPDATE is decided by configuration
   and outbound policy of the BGP speaker.  A validating BGP speaker
   MUST apply Route Origin Validation policy semantics (see Section 2 of
   [RFC6811] and Section 4 of [RFC8481]) after applying any egress
   configuration and policy.

   This effective origin AS of the announcement might be affected by
   removal of private ASes, confederation [RFC5065], migration
   [RFC7705], etc.  Any AS_PATH modifications resulting in effective
   origin AS change MUST be taken into account.

   This document updates [RFC6811] by clarifying that implementations
   must use the effective origin AS to determine the Origin Validation
   state when applying egress policy.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Suggested Reading

   It is assumed that the reader understands BGP [RFC4271], the RPKI
   [RFC6480], Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) [RFC6482], RPKI-based
   Prefix Validation [RFC6811], and Origin Validation Clarifications
   [RFC8481].

3.  Egress Processing

   BGP implementations supporting RPKI-based origin validation MUST
   provide the same policy configuration primitives for decisions based
   on the validation state available for use in ingress, redistribution,
   and egress policies.  When applied to egress policy, validation state
   MUST be determined using the effective origin AS of the route as it
   will (or would) be announced to the peer.  The effective origin AS
   may differ from that of the route in the RIB due to commonly
   available knobs, such as removal of private ASes, AS path
   manipulation, confederation handling, etc.

   Egress policy handling can provide more robust protection for
   outbound eBGP than relying solely on ingress (iBGP, eBGP, connected,
   static, etc.) redistribution being configured and working correctly
   -- i.e., better support for the robustness principle.

4.  Operational Considerations

   Configurations may have a complex policy where the effective origin
   AS may not be easily determined before the outbound policies have
   been run.  It SHOULD be possible to specify a selective origin
   validation policy to be applied after any existing non-validating
   outbound policies.

   An implementation SHOULD be able to list announcements that were not
   sent to a peer, e.g., because they were marked Invalid, as long as
   the router still has them in memory.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not create security considerations beyond those of
   [RFC6811] and [RFC8481].  By facilitating more correct validation, it
   attempts to improve BGP reliability.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
