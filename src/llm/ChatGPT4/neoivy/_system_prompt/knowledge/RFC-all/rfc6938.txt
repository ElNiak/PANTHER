RFC 6938                Deprecation of DPA et al.               May 2013


1.  Introduction

   As of this writing, the BGP Path Attributes registry maintained by
   IANA contains entries for DPA, ADVERTISER, and RCID_PATH /
   CLUSTER_ID.  The first of these is associated with [BGPDPA], an
   Internet-Draft that was abandoned in 1996.  The latter are associated
   with [RFC1863], an RFC that was reclassified as Historic by [RFC4223]
   in 2005.  Neither specification is currently in use, nor have they
   ever been.

   Note that the deprecated CLUSTER_ID is distinct from CLUSTER_LIST
   [RFC4456].  CLUSTER_LIST is not being deprecated.

2.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has marked the BGP Path Attributes registry
   entries for DPA (Value 11), ADVERTISER (Value 12), and RCID_PATH /
   CLUSTER_ID (Value 13) as "deprecated".

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
   registry update.
