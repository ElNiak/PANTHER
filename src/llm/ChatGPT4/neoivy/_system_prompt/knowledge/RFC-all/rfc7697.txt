RFC 7697                   MPLS-TP OAM ID MIB               January 2016


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling a Transport
   Profile (TP) based on Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [RFC3031].

   This MIB module should be used for performing the OAM (Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance) operations for MPLS Tunnel LSPs
   (Label Switched Paths), Pseudowires, and Sections.

   At the time of this writing, SNMP SET is no longer recommended as a
   way to configure MPLS networks as was described in [RFC3812].
   However, since the MIB modules specified in this document are
   intended to work in parallel with the MIB modules for MPLS specified
   in [RFC3812], certain objects defined here are specified with a
   MAX-ACCESS of read-write or read-create so that specifications of the
   base tables in [RFC3812] and the new MIB modules in this document are
   consistent.  Although the example described in Section 6 specifies
   means to configure OAM identifiers for MPLS-TP Tunnels, this should
   be seen as indicating how the MIB values would be returned in the
   specified circumstances having been configured by alternative means.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Feature List

   The MPLS transport profile OAM identifiers MIB module is designed to
   satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

   -  The MIB module supports configuration of OAM identifiers for MPLS
      point-to-point Tunnels, point-to-multipoint LSPs, co-routed
      bidirectional LSPs, associated bidirectional LSPs, and
      Pseudowires.

5.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   The objects described in this section support the functionality
   described in [RFC5654] and [RFC6370].  The tables support both
   IP-compatible and ICC-based OAM identifiers configurations for MPLS
   Tunnels, LSPs, and Pseudowires.

5.1.  mplsOamIdMegTable

   The mplsOamIdMegTable is used to manage one or more Maintenance
   Entities (MEs) that belong to the same transport path.

   When a new entry is created with mplsOamIdMegOperatorType set to
   ipCompatible (1), then as per [RFC6370] (MEG_ID for an LSP is LSP_ID,
   and MEG_ID for a PW is PW_Path_ID), MEP_ID can be automatically
   formed.

   For an ICC-based transport path, the user is expected to configure
   the ICC identifier explicitly in this table for MPLS Tunnels, LSPs,
   and Pseudowires.

5.2.  mplsOamIdMeTable

   The mplsOamIdMeTable defines a relationship between two points
   (source and sink) of a transport path to which maintenance and
   monitoring operations apply.  The two points that define an ME are
   called Maintenance Entity Group End Points (MEPs).

   In between MEPs, there are zero or more intermediate points, called
   Maintenance Entity Group Intermediate Points (MIPs).  MEPs and MIPs
   are associated with the MEG and can be shared by more than one ME in
   a MEG.

6.  MPLS OAM Identifier Configuration for MPLS LSP: Example

   In this section, we provide an example of the OAM identifier
   configuration for an MPLS co-routed bidirectional LSP.

   This example provides usage of MEG and ME tables for management and
   monitoring operations of an MPLS LSP.

   This example considers the OAM identifiers configuration on a
   head-end LSR to manage and monitor an MPLS LSP.  Only relevant
   objects that are applicable for IP-based OAM identifiers of MPLS
   co-routed bidirectional LSPs are illustrated here.

      In the mplsOamIdMegTable:

      {
        -- MEG index (Index to the table)
        mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 1,
        mplsOamIdMegName                  = "MEG1",
        mplsOamIdMegOperatorType          = ipCompatible (1),
        mplsOamIdMegServicePointerType    = lsp (1),
        mplsOamIdMegMpLocation            = perNode (1),
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here

        mplsOamIdMegRowStatus             = createAndGo (4),
        mplsOamIdMegPathFlow
                             = coRoutedBidirectionalPointToPoint (2)
      }

      This will create an entry in the mplsOamIdMegTable to manage and
      monitor the MPLS Tunnel.

      The following ME table is used to associate the path information
      to a MEG.

         In the mplsOamIdMeTable:

         {
         -- ME index (Index to the table)
          mplsOamIdMeIndex                  = 1,

         -- MP index (Index to the table)
          mplsOamIdMeMpIndex                = 1,
          mplsOamIdMeName                   = "ME1",
          mplsOamIdMeMpIfIndex              = 0,
         -- The source MEP ID is derived from the IP-compatible MPLS LSP
          mplsOamIdMeSourceMepIndex         = 0,
         -- The sink MEP ID is derived from the IP-compatible MPLS LSP
          mplsOamIdMeSinkMepIndex           = 0,
          mplsOamIdMeMpType                 = mep (1),
          mplsOamIdMeMepDirection           = down (2),
         --  RowPointer MUST point to the first accessible column of an
         --  MPLS LSP
          mplsOamIdMeServicePointer         = mplsTunnelName.1.1.10.20,
         -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
          mplsOamIdMeRowStatus              = createAndGo (4)
         }

             MEP_ID is retrieved from the mplsOamIdMegServicePointer

             defined.

             An ME is a point-to-point entity.  One ME has two such
             MEPs.  A MEG is a group of one or more MEs.  One MEG can
             have two or more MEPs.

             For a point-to-point LSP, one MEG has one ME, and this ME
             is associated with two MEPs (source and sink MEPs) within
             a MEG.  Each mplsOamIdMeIndex value denotes the ME within
             a MEG.

             In the case of unidirectional point-to-point transport
             paths, a single unidirectional ME is defined to monitor
             it, and mplsOamIdMeServicePointer points to a
             unidirectional point-to-point path.

             In the case of associated bidirectional point-to-point
             transport paths, two independent unidirectional
             MEs are defined to independently monitor each direction,
             and each mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object points to a
             unique unidirectional transport path.
             This has implications for transactions that terminate at
             or query a MIP, as a return path from a MIP to a source
             MEP does not necessarily exist within the MEG.

             In the case of co-routed bidirectional point-to-point
             transport paths, a single bidirectional ME is defined to
             monitor both directions congruently, and the
             mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object points to a co-routed
             bidirectional point-to-point transport path.

             In the case of unidirectional point-to-multipoint transport
             paths, a single unidirectional ME for each leaf is defined
             to monitor the transport path from the root to that leaf,
             and each leaf has different transport path information in
             the mplsOamIdMeServicePointer MIB object.  Note that the
             MplsOamIdMeEntry should be created manually once the MEG

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system that will provide network connectivity
   and packet forwarding services.  As such, improper manipulation of
   the objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service
   to a large number of end-users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - The mplsOamIdMegTable and the mplsOamIdMeTable collectively show
     the MPLS OAM characteristics.  If an administrator does not want to
     reveal this information, then these tables should be considered
     sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   As described in [RFC4221] and [RFC6639], and as requested in the
   MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [RFC3811], MPLS-related Standards Track MIB modules
   should be rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  The following
   subsection lists a new assignment that has been made by IANA under
   the mplsStdMIB subtree for the MPLS-OAM-ID-STD-MIB module defined in
   this document.  New assignments can only be made via a Standards
   Action as specified in [RFC5226].

9.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-OAM-ID-STD-MIB

   IANA has to assign the OID { mplsStdMIB 21 } to the
   MPLS-OAM-ID-STD-MIB module specified in this document.
