  Signaling Entropy Label Capability and Entropy Readable Label Depth
                               Using OSPF

Abstract

   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has defined a mechanism to load-
   balance traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  An ingress Label
   Switching Router (LSR) cannot insert ELs for packets going into a
   given Label Switched Path (LSP) unless an egress LSR has indicated
   via signaling that it has the capability to process ELs, referred to
   as the Entropy Label Capability (ELC), on that LSP.  In addition, it
   would be useful for ingress LSRs to know each LSR's capability for
   reading the maximum label stack depth and performing EL-based load-
   balancing, referred to as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD).  This
   document defines a mechanism to signal these two capabilities using
   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, and Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS).

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6790] describes a method to load-balance Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (MPLS) traffic flows using Entropy Labels (EL).  It also
   introduces the concept of Entropy Label Capability (ELC) and defines
   the signaling of this capability via MPLS signaling protocols.
   Recently, mechanisms have been defined to signal labels via link-
   state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) such as OSPFv2 [RFC8665] and
   OSPFv3 [RFC8666].  This document defines a mechanism to signal the
   ELC using OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

   In cases where Segment Routing (SR) is used with the MPLS data plane
   (e.g., SR-MPLS [RFC8660]), it would be useful for ingress LSRs to
   know each intermediate LSR's capability of reading the maximum label
   stack depth and performing EL-based load-balancing.  This capability,
   referred to as Entropy Readable Label Depth (ERLD) as defined in
   [RFC8662], may be used by ingress LSRs to determine the position of
   the EL label in the stack, and whether it is necessary to insert
   multiple ELs at different positions in the label stack.  This
   document defines a mechanism to signal the ERLD using OSPFv2 and
   OSPFv3.

2.  Terminology

   This memo makes use of the terms defined in [RFC6790] and [RFC8662].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The key word OSPF is used throughout the document to refer to both
   OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.

3.  Advertising ELC Using OSPF

   Even though ELC is a property of the node, in some cases it is
   advantageous to associate and advertise the ELC with a prefix.  In
   multi-area networks, routers may not know the identity of the prefix
   originator in a remote area or may not know the capabilities of such
   an originator.  Similarly, in a multi-domain network, the identity of
   the prefix originator and its capabilities may not be known to the
   ingress LSR.

   If a router has multiple interfaces, the router MUST NOT announce ELC
   unless all of its interfaces are capable of processing ELs.

   If the router supports ELs on all of its interfaces, it SHOULD
   advertise the ELC with every local host prefix it advertises in OSPF.

3.1.  Advertising ELC Using OSPFv2

   [RFC7684] defines the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV to advertise
   additional attributes associated with a prefix.  The OSPFv2 Extended
   Prefix TLV includes a one-octet Flags field.  A new flag in the Flags
   field is used to signal the ELC for the prefix:

   0x20 - E-Flag (ELC Flag):
      Set by the advertising router to indicate that the prefix
      originator is capable of processing ELs.

   The ELC signaling MUST be preserved when an OSPF Area Border Router
   (ABR) distributes information between areas.  To do so, an ABR MUST
   originate an OSPFv2 Extended Prefix Opaque Link State Advertisement
   (LSA) [RFC7684] including the received ELC setting.

   When an OSPF Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) redistributes a
   prefix from another instance of OSPF or from some other protocol, it
   SHOULD preserve the ELC signaling for the prefix if it exists.  To do
   so, an ASBR SHOULD originate an Extended Prefix Opaque LSA [RFC7684]
   including the ELC setting of the redistributed prefix.  The flooding
   scope of the Extended Prefix Opaque LSA MUST match the flooding scope
   of the LSA that an ASBR originates as a result of the redistribution.
   The exact mechanism used to exchange ELC between protocol instances
   on an ASBR is outside of the scope of this document.

3.2.  Advertising ELC Using OSPFv3

   [RFC5340] defines the OSPFv3 PrefixOptions field to indicate
   capabilities associated with a prefix.  A new bit in the OSPFv3
   PrefixOptions field is used to signal the ELC for the prefix:

   0x40 - E-Flag (ELC Flag):
      Set by the advertising router to indicate that the prefix
      originator is capable of processing ELs.

   The ELC signaling MUST be preserved when an OSPFv3 Area Border Router
   (ABR) distributes information between areas.  The setting of the ELC
   Flag in the Inter-Area-Prefix-LSA [RFC5340] or in the Inter-Area-
   Prefix TLV [RFC8362], generated by an ABR, MUST be the same as the
   value the ELC Flag associated with the prefix in the source area.

   When an OSPFv3 Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) redistributes a
   prefix from another instance of OSPFv3 or from some other protocol,
   it SHOULD preserve the ELC signaling for the prefix if it exists.
   The setting of the ELC Flag in the AS-External-LSA, Not-So-Stubby
   Area LSA (NSSA-LSA) [RFC5340], or in the External-Prefix TLV
   [RFC8362], generated by an ASBR, MUST be the same as the value of the
   ELC Flag associated with the prefix in the source domain.  The exact
   mechanism used to exchange ELC between protocol instances on the ASBR
   is outside of the scope of this document.

4.  Advertising ERLD Using OSPF

   The ERLD is advertised in a Node Maximum SID Depth (MSD) TLV
   [RFC8476] using the ERLD-MSD type defined in [RFC9088].

   If a router has multiple interfaces with different capabilities of
   reading the maximum label stack depth, the router MUST advertise the
   smallest value found across all of its interfaces.

   The absence of ERLD-MSD advertisements indicates only that the
   advertising node does not support advertisement of this capability.

   When the ERLD-MSD type is received in the OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 Link MSD
   sub-TLV [RFC8476], it MUST be ignored.

   The considerations for advertising the ERLD are specified in
   [RFC8662].

5.  Signaling ELC and ERLD in BGP-LS

   The OSPF extensions defined in this document can be advertised via
   BGP-LS (distribution of Link-State and TE information using BGP)
   [RFC7752] using existing BGP-LS TLVs.

   The ELC is advertised using the Prefix Attribute Flags TLV as defined
   in [RFC9085].

   The ERLD-MSD is advertised using the Node MSD TLV as defined in
   [RFC8814].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has completed the following actions for this document:

   *  Flag 0x20 in the "OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV Flags" registry has
      been allocated to the E-Flag (ELC Flag).

   *  Bit 0x40 in the "OSPFv3 Prefix Options (8 bits)" registry has been
      allocated to the E-Flag (ELC Flag).

7.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies the ability to advertise additional node
   capabilities using OSPF and BGP-LS.  As such, the security
   considerations as described in [RFC5340], [RFC7684], [RFC7752],
   [RFC7770], [RFC8476], [RFC8662], [RFC8814], and [RFC9085] are
   applicable to this document.

   Incorrectly setting the E-Flag during origination, propagation, or
   redistribution may lead to poor or no load-balancing of the MPLS
   traffic or to the MPLS traffic being discarded on the egress node.

   Incorrectly setting of the ERLD value may lead to poor or no load-
   balancing of the MPLS traffic.
