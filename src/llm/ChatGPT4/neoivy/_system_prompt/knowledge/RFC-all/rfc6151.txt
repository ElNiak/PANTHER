RFC 6151        MD5 and HMAC-MD5 Security Considerations      March 2011


1.  Introduction

   MD5 [MD5] is a message digest algorithm that takes as input a message
   of arbitrary length and produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or
   "message digest" of the input.  The published attacks against MD5
   show that it is not prudent to use MD5 when collision resistance is
   required.  This document replaces the security considerations in RFC
   1321 [MD5].

   [HMAC] defined a mechanism for message authentication using
   cryptographic hash functions.  Any message digest algorithm can be
   used, but the cryptographic strength of HMAC depends on the
   properties of the underlying hash function.  [HMAC-MD5] defined test
   cases for HMAC-MD5.  This document updates the security
   considerations in [HMAC], which [HMAC-MD5] points to for its security
   considerations.

   [HASH-Attack] summarizes the use of hashes in many protocols and
   discusses how attacks against a message digest algorithm's one-way
   and collision-free properties affect and do not affect Internet
   protocols.  Familiarity with [HASH-Attack] is assumed.  One of the
   uses of message digest algorithms in [HASH-Attack] was integrity
   protection.  Where the MD5 checksum is used inline with the protocol
   solely to protect against errors, an MD5 checksum is still an
   acceptable use.  Applications and protocols need to clearly state in
   their security considerations what security services, if any, are
   expected from the MD5 checksum.  In fact, any application and
   protocol that employs MD5 for any purpose needs to clearly state the
   expected security services from their use of MD5.

2.  Security Considerations

   MD5 was published in 1992 as an Informational RFC.  Since that time,
   MD5 has been extensively studied and new cryptographic attacks have
   been discovered.  Message digest algorithms are designed to provide
   collision, pre-image, and second pre-image resistance.  In addition,
   message digest algorithms are used with a shared secret value for
   message authentication in HMAC, and in this context, some people may
   find the guidance for key lengths and algorithm strengths in
   [SP800-57] and [SP800-131] useful.

   MD5 is no longer acceptable where collision resistance is required
   such as digital signatures.  It is not urgent to stop using MD5 in
   other ways, such as HMAC-MD5; however, since MD5 must not be used for
   digital signatures, new protocol designs should not employ HMAC-MD5.
   Alternatives to HMAC-MD5 include HMAC-SHA256 [HMAC] [HMAC-SHA256] and
   [AES-CMAC] when AES is more readily available than a hash function.

RFC 6151        MD5 and HMAC-MD5 Security Considerations      March 2011


2.1.  Collision Resistance

   Pseudo-collisions for the compress function of MD5 were first
   described in 1993 [denBBO1993].  In 1996, [DOB1995] demonstrated a
   collision pair for the MD5 compression function with a chosen initial
   value.  The first paper that demonstrated two collision pairs for MD5
   was published in 2004 [WFLY2004].  The detailed attack techniques for
   MD5 were published at EUROCRYPT 2005 [WAYU2005].  Since then, a lot
   of research results have been published to improve collision attacks
   on MD5. The attacks presented in [KLIM2006] can find MD5 collision in
   about one minute on a standard notebook PC (Intel Pentium, 1.6GHz).
   [STEV2007] claims that it takes 10 seconds or less on a 2.6Ghz
   Pentium4 to find collisions.  In [STEV2007], [SLdeW2007],
   [SSALMOdeW2009], and [SLdeW2009], the collision attacks on MD5 were
   successfully applied to X.509 certificates.

   Notice that the collision attack on MD5 can also be applied to
   password-based challenge-and-response authentication protocols such
   as the APOP (Authenticated Post Office Protocol) option in POP [POP]
   used in post office authentication as presented in [LEUR2007].

   In fact, more delicate attacks on MD5 to improve the speed of finding
   collisions have been published recently.  However, the aforementioned
   results have provided sufficient reason to eliminate MD5 usage in
   applications where collision resistance is required such as digital
   signatures.

2.2.  Pre-Image and Second Pre-Image Resistance

   Even though the best result can find a pre-image attack of MD5 faster
   than exhaustive search, as presented in [SAAO2009], the complexity
   2^123.4 is still pretty high.

2.3.  HMAC

   The cryptanalysis of HMAC-MD5 is usually conducted together with NMAC
   (Nested MAC) since they are closely related.  NMAC uses two
   independent keys K1 and K2 such that NMAC(K1, K2, M) = H(K1, H(K2,
   M), where K1 and K2 are used as secret initialization vectors (IVs)
   for hash function H(IV, M).  If we re-write the HMAC equation using
   two secret IVs such that IV2 = H(K Xor ipad) and IV1 = H(K Xor opad),
   then HMAC(K, M) = NMAC(IV1, IV2, M).  Here it is very important to
   notice that IV1 and IV2 are not independently selected.

   The first analysis was explored on NMAC-MD5 using related keys in
   [COYI2006].  The partial key recovery attack cannot be extended to
   HMAC-MD5, since for HMAC, recovering partial secret IVs can hardly
   lead to recovering (partial) key K.  Another paper presented at



Turner & Chen                 Informational                     [Page 3]

RFC 6151        MD5 and HMAC-MD5 Security Considerations      March 2011


   Crypto 2007 [FLN2007] extended results of [COYI2006] to a full key
   recovery attack on NMAC-MD5.  Since it also uses related key attack,
   it does not seem applicable to HMAC-MD5.

   A EUROCRYPT 2009 paper presented a distinguishing attack on HMAC-MD5
   [WYWZZ2009] without using related keys.  It can distinguish an
   instantiation of HMAC with MD5 from an instantiation with a random
   function with 2^97 queries with probability 0.87.  This is called
   distinguishing-H.  Using the distinguishing attack, it can recover
   some bits of the intermediate status of the second block.  However,
   as it is pointed out in [WYWZZ2009], it cannot be used to recover the
   (partial) inner key H(K Xor ipad).  It is not obvious how the attack
   can be used to form a forgery attack either.

   The attacks on HMAC-MD5 do not seem to indicate a practical
   vulnerability when used as a message authentication code.
   Considering that the distinguishing-H attack is different from a
   distinguishing-R attack, which distinguishes an HMAC from a random
   function, the practical impact on HMAC usage as a pseudorandom
   function (PRF) such as in a key derivation function is not well
   understood.

   Therefore, it may not be urgent to remove HMAC-MD5 from the existing
   protocols.  However, since MD5 must not be used for digital
   signatures, for a new protocol design, a ciphersuite with HMAC-MD5
   should not be included.  Options include HMAC-SHA256 [HMAC]
   [HMAC-SHA256] and [AES-CMAC] when AES is more readily available than
   a hash function.
