1.  Introduction

   The E.164 to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) [RFC3986] Dynamic
   Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) Application (ENUM) [RFC6116]
   transforms E.164 [E164] numbers into URIs using the Domain Name
   System (DNS) [RFC1035].

   IAX (Inter-Asterisk eXchange) [RFC5456] is an "all-in-one" protocol
   for handling multimedia in IP networks.  It combines both control and
   media services in the same protocol.

   This document registers an Enumservice for the IAX [RFC5456] protocol
   according to the guidelines given in [RFC6117].

              The 'iax' Enumservice is used to map E.164 numbers to
              IAX URIs.  Such URIs identify resources capable of being
              contacted to provide a communication session using the
              IAX protocol <xref target="RFC5456"/>.

            <paragraph>
              A client selecting this NAPTR needs to be able to support

RFC 6315         IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'       July 2011


3.  Examples

   The following examples are just for illustrative purposes and will in
   no way limit the usage of the 'iax' Enumservice to other usage
   scenarios.

3.1.  Simple IAX URI

   The following Naming Authority Pointer (NAPTR) resource record is an
   example of the 'iax' Enumservice.

     $ORIGIN 8.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                "!^.*$!iax:example.com/alice!" . )

   This contact information indicates that the party addressed by the
   E.164 number +442079460148 can be contacted using the IAX protocol to
   domain 'example.com'.  The called party, service, or program on that
   domain is identified by 'alice'.

3.2.  IAX URI with a Context

   The following is an example of the 'iax' Enumservice using an IPv6
   destination address and a destination 'context'.

     $ORIGIN 9.4.1.0.6.4.9.7.0.2.4.4.e164.arpa.

     @     IN NAPTR ( 10 100 "u" "E2U+iax"
                "!^.*$!iax:[2001:db8::1]:4569/alice?friends!" . )

   This NAPTR resource record indicates that +442079460149 may be
   contacted by using the IAX protocol at IPv6 address 2001:db8::1,
   port 4569 with the called party 'alice' in the context (or user
   partition) 'friends'.  For further usage of IAX URIs, see Section 5
   of [RFC5456].

4.  Security Considerations

   The 'iax' Enumservice does not introduce any new security issues
   beyond any already present in the ENUM, DNS, and IAX protocols,
   except that this Enumservice provides for disclosure of information
   that may facilitate an attack or a violation of user privacy in some
   way.  The primary result of these exploits is unwanted
   communications.  These issues are discussed in further detail in
   [RFC3833].

RFC 6315         IANA Registration for Enumservice 'iax'       July 2011


   The use of DNS Security (DNSSEC) [RFC4033] is recommended to improve
   operational security.

   For security considerations that apply to all Enumservices, please
   refer to RFC 6116, Section 7.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the 'iax' Enumservice according to the
   guidelines and specifications in [RFC6117] and the definitions in
   Section 2 in this document.

6.  DNS Considerations

   Misconfiguration or delays in zone changes can result in call loops,
   perhaps with different protocols or networks.  Implementations should
   take care to ensure such loops can be detected without interrupting
   other services, including SIP-based, IAX-based, and DNS itself.
