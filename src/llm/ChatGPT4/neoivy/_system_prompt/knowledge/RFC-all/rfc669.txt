         November, 1974, Survey of New-Protocol TELNET Servers


   Two months have elapsed since our last survey, and the appearance of
   additional New-Protocol servers has progressed at the usual snail's
   pace.  The changes in this list are (with host numbers in octal):

   SRI-AI (102) now has a New-Protocol server;
   SDC-LAB (10) is back on the net and the list;
   SDC-CC (110) is coming on the net but status is as yet unknown;
   USC-ISI (126) and USC-ISIB (226) (formerly ISI-DEVTENEX) now have
   New-Protocol servers;
   SDAC-44 (32) has been removed -- no longer classed as a server host;
   HAWAII-500 (344) is coming on the net, status presently unknown;
   LONDON (52) has been added;
   BBN-TENEXD is now host 162 (formerly 205).

   What follows is an update of the summary and tabulation that appeared
   in RFC #702.*  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?

         total server hosts             37      100%
         no New-Prot server             19       51%
         unknown status (new host)       2        6%
         total New-Prot implem.         16       43%
             New-Prot on socket 27,
                 Old on socket 1 (2)     9       24%
             New-Prot on 1 and 27 (3)    6       16%
             New-Prot on 1 only (3)      1        3%

         Notes:

   *   All data in this report were gathered via a surveying program run
       at various times, plus a few manual checks to fill out the data.
       What is reported here is the way the various servers work as seen
       by the new-Protocol User Telnet at BBNA, as of 4 Dec. 1974.

   (2) These are the sites whose operation is 100% correct according to
       all protocols and conventions, as I understand them.

   (3) We realize that some of the servers that appear here as New-
       Protocol servers on socket 1 are actually servers which attempt
       to communicate with both Old- and New-Protocol User TELNETs
       according to what control sequences are received.

   Note: * These servers return improper responses to some TELNET option
   requests.
