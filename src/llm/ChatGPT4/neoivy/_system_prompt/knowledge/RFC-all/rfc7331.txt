1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the MIB for use with network
   management protocols in the Internet community.  In particular, it
   describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor Bidirectional
   Forwarding Detection for [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], and
   [RFC7130], BFD versions 0 and/or 1, on devices supporting this
   feature.

   This memo does not define a compliance requirement for a system that
   only implements BFD version 0.  This is a reflection of a considered
   and deliberate decision by the BFD WG because the BFD version 0
   protocol is primarily of historical interest by comparison to the
   widespread deployment of the BFD version 1 protocol.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,




Nadeau, et al.               Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 7331                       BFD-STD-MIB                   August 2014


   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   As with all MIB modules, an attempt to SET or CREATE an object to a
   value that is not supported by the implementation will result in a
   failure using a return code that indicates that the value is not
   supported.

3.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, acronyms, and mechanisms
   described in [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], and [RFC7130].  Unless
   otherwise stated, the mechanisms described therein will not be
   redescribed here.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Brief Description of MIB Objects

   This section describes objects pertaining to BFD.  The MIB objects
   are derived from [RFC5880], [RFC5881], [RFC5883], and [RFC7130], and
   also include textual conventions defined in [RFC7330].

4.1.  General Variables

   The General Variables are used to identify parameters that are global
   to the BFD process.

4.2.  Session Table (bfdSessionTable)

   The session table is used to identify a BFD session between a pair of
   nodes.

4.3.  Session Performance Table (bfdSessionPerfTable)

   The session performance table is used for collecting BFD performance
   counters on a per-session basis.  This table is an AUGMENT to the
   bfdSessionTable.

4.4.  BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table (bfdSessDiscMapTable)

   The BFD Session Discriminator Mapping Table provides a mapping
   between a local discriminator value to the associated BFD session
   found in the bfdSessionTable.

RFC 7331                       BFD-STD-MIB                   August 2014


4.5.  BFD Session IP Mapping Table (bfdSessIpMapTable)

   Given bfdSessInterface, bfdSessSrcAddrType, bfdSessSrcAddr,
   bfdSessDstAddrType, and bfdSessSrcAddrType, the BFD Session IP
   Mapping Table maps to an associated BFD session found in the
   bfdSessionTable.  This table SHOULD contain those BFD sessions that
   are of type "IP".

5.  BFD MIB Module Definitions

   This MIB module makes references to the following documents:
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], [RFC3289], [RFC3413],
   [RFC5082], [RFC5880], and [RFC5881].

6.  Security Considerations

   As BFD may be tied into the stability of the network infrastructure
   (such as routing protocols), the effects of an attack on a BFD
   session may be very serious.  This ultimately has denial-of-service
   effects, as links may be declared to be down (or falsely declared to
   be up.)  As such, improper manipulation of the objects represented by
   this MIB may result in denial of service to a large number of end
   users.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  bfdAdminStatus -- Improper change of bfdAdminStatus, to
      disabled(2), adminDown(3), or down(4), can cause significant
      disruption of the connectivity to those portions of the Internet
      reached via all the applicable remote BFD peers.

   o  bfdSessAdminStatus -- Improper change of bfdSessAdminStatus, to
      disabled(2), adminDown(3), or down(4), can cause significant
      disruption of the connectivity to those portions of the Internet
      reached via all the applicable remote BFD peers.

   o  bfdSessDesiredMinTxInterval, bfdSessReqMinRxInterval,
      bfdSessReqMinEchoRxInterval, bfdSessDetectMult -- Improper change
      of this object can cause connections to be disrupted for extremely
      long time periods when otherwise they would be restored in a
      relatively short period of time.

   o  Some management objects define the BFD session whilst other
      management objects define the parameter of the BFD session.  It is
      particularly important to control the support for SET access to
      those management objects that define the BFD session, as changes
      to them can be disruptive.  Implementation SHOULD NOT allow
      changes to following management objects when bfdSessState is
      up(4):

      *  bfdSessVersionNumber

      *  bfdSessType

      *  bfdSessDestinationUdpPort

RFC 7331                       BFD-STD-MIB                   August 2014


      *  bfdSessMultipointFlag

      *  bfdSessInterface

      *  bfdSessSrcAddrType

      *  bfdSessSrcAddr

      *  bfdSessDstAddrType

      *  bfdSessDstAddr

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY
   access to these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of
   these objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   o  The bfdSessTable may be used to directly configure BFD sessions.
      The bfdSessMapTable can be used indirectly in the same way.
      Unauthorized access to objects in this table could result in
      disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true if
      an unauthorized user configures enough tables to invoke a
      denial-of-service attack on the device where they are configured,
      or on a remote device where the sessions terminate.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The bfdSessPerfTable allows access to the performance
      characteristics of BFD sessions.  Network administrators not
      wishing to show this information should consider this table
      sensitive.

   The bfdSessAuthenticationType, bfdSessAuthenticationKeyID, and
   bfdSessAuthenticationKey objects hold security methods and associated
   security keys of BFD sessions.  These objects are highly sensitive.
   In order to prevent this sensitive information from being improperly
   accessed, implementers SHOULD disallow access to these objects.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),



Nadeau, et al.               Standards Track                   [Page 36]

RFC 7331                       BFD-STD-MIB                   August 2014


   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full
   support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication
   and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the "SMI Network Management MGMT
   Codes" registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------
        bfdMIB            { mib-2 222 }
