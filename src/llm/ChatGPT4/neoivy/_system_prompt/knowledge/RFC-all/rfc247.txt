                  Proferred Set of Standard Host Names

   In RFC #226, BBN's TENEX list of Host names was set up as a strawman
   set of standard Host names.  Comments received since then (an RFC
   actually generated comments!!!) have influenced me to propose the
   following general rules for forming Host names.

   The Host names will be 8 characters in length.  The general form is

                     <site>  '-'  <machine>

   <site> will be at most 4 characters, formed as follows:

        (a)  Use the keyword in the site name, if not more than
             four characters, e.g., NASA Ames, Case Western
             Reserve.                    ----  ----

        (b)  Use the standard acronym, if not more than four
             characters, e.g., UCLA, RADC, NBS.

        (c)  If a standard abbreviation exists, use it, e.g., Ill.

        (d)  If none of the above apply, use the first four letters
             in the site name, e.g., Burr, Mitr, Harv.

        (e)  If none of the above is acceptable to the site, the
             technical liaison should select the site mnemonic.

   <machine> will be at most 4 characters of the form <mfg. #>
   <designator>.
   Examples of mfg. # are:

             IBM 360             2 digit model number
             IBM 370             3 digit model number
             PDP                 1 - 2 digit model number
             Burroughs           4 digits
             CDC                 4 digits
             etc.







                                                                [Page 1]

RFC #247


   <designator> will be used when more than one machine of the same
   type is located at a site (e.g., 2 PDP-10s at MIT, at SRI, and
   at BBN).

   Limiting <machine> to 4 characters does not permit distinctions
   to be made between machines with 4 digit mfg.  #s.  I expect
   the situation will be handled in an ad hoc manner by the NIC if
   it arises.

   TIPs are identified as 'TIP' rather than by '316'.  If a Host
   is not to be permanently addressable, the machine is identified
   as 'TEST'.

   A list of Host names, formed according to these rules, is
   attached.  Alternate Host names should be provided, as
   suggested by Jon Postel (RFC #236).  RFC's 206, 233, and
   236 present lists with 4-character alternate names.  The
   Technical Liaison should select the alternate name for his
   site and communicate the selection to the NIC.


   The preceding rules and the attached list of Host names are
   subject to the approval of the NWG.  Hereafter, the list will
   be generated and maintained by the NIC in cooperation with
   the Technical Liaison at each site, as suggested in RFC #237.
   Comments should be addressed to Dick Watson.

RFC #247

                  An Implementation Scheme

If the standard Host names are formed according to the proposed
rules, the following implementation scheme, suggested by Steve
Crocker, can be used.

        Map <site> into an 8-bit number, S and
        map <machine> into an 8-bit number, M,
        where
                  S + M = Network Address.

        S and M can be selected such that specification of <site>
        alone could cause a default to the "primary" Host at
        the site.  Note that this scheme depends on a unique
        <site> designator for each IMP.

Some examples:

If the "primary" Host at UCLA is the 91, let
        UCLA  -> S = X'41'
           7  -> M = X'40'
          91  -> M = X'00'
then for
        UCLA-7, S + M = X'01' = 1 base 10
        UCLA-91,S + M = X'41' = 65 base 10

and
        UCLA alone = X'41' = 65 base 10

If the primary Host at BBN is TENEX System A, let
        BBN  ->  S = X'45'
        516  ->  M = X'40'
        10A  ->  M = X'00'
        10B  ->  M = X'C0'
then for
        BBN-516, S + M = X'05' = 5 base 10
        BBN-10A, S + M = X'45' = 69 base 10
        BBN-10B, S + M = X'85' = 133 base 10

and
        BBN alone = X'45' = 69 base 10

The primary Host for each IMP would be designated by the
site and such information disseminated by the NIC.
