1.  Introduction

   [RFC6513], [RFC6514], and [RFC6625] specify procedures for supporting
   multicast in Multiprotocol Label Switching/Border Gateway Protocol
   (MPLS/BGP) Layer 3 (IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).  Throughout
   this document, we will use the term "MVPN" (for "multicast VPN")
   [RFC6513] to refer to a BGP/MPLS IP VPN that supports multicast.

   Provider Edge (PE) routers that attach to a particular MVPN exchange
   customer multicast (C-multicast) routing information with neighboring
   PEs.  In [RFC6513], two basic methods for exchanging C-multicast
   routing information are defined: (1) Protocol Independent Multicast
   (PIM) [RFC7761] and (2) BGP.

   In the rest of this document, we will use the term "PIM-MVPN" to
   refer to the case where PIM is used for exchanging C-multicast
   routing information and "BGP-MVPN" to refer to the case where BGP is
   used for exchanging C-multicast routing information.

   This document describes managed objects to configure and/or monitor
   MVPNs.  Most of the managed objects are common to both PIM-MVPN and
   BGP-MVPN, and some managed objects are BGP-MVPN specific.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document adopts the definitions, abbreviations, and mechanisms
   described in [RFC4364], [RFC6513], and [RFC6514].  Familiarity with
   multicast, MPLS, Layer 3 (L3) VPN, and MVPN concepts and/or
   mechanisms is assumed.  Some terms specifically related to this
   document are explained below.

RFC 8503                  L3 VPN Multicast MIB             December 2018


   An MVPN can be realized by using various kinds of transport
   mechanisms for forwarding a packet to all or a subset of PEs across
   service provider networks.  Such transport mechanisms are referred to
   as provider tunnels (P-tunnels).

   A Provider Multicast Service Interface (PMSI) [RFC6513] is a
   conceptual interface instantiated by a P-tunnel.  A PE uses a PMSI to
   send customer multicast traffic to all or some PEs in the same VPN.

   There are two kinds of PMSIs: Inclusive PMSI (I-PMSI) and Selective
   PMSI (S-PMSI) [RFC6513].  An I-PMSI enables a PE attached to a
   particular MVPN to transmit a message to all PEs in the same MVPN.
   An S-PMSI enables a PE to transmit a message to a selected set of PEs
   in the same MVPN.

   As described in [RFC4382], each PE maintains one default forwarding
   table and zero or more Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) tables.
   Throughout this document, we will use the term "MVRF" (for "multicast
   VRF") to refer to a VRF that contains multicast routing information.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB

   This document defines BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB, a MIB module
   for monitoring and/or configuring MVPNs on PEs.  This MIB module will
   be used in conjunction with MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB [RFC4382] and IPMCAST-
   MIB [RFC5132].

RFC 8503                  L3 VPN Multicast MIB             December 2018


3.1.  Summary of the MIB Module

   BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB provides the following
   functionalities.

   o  Monitoring attributes of MVPNs on a PE

   o  Configuring timers and thresholds related to an MVPN on a PE

   o  Notifying creation, deletion, and modification of MVRFs on a PE

   o  Monitoring PMSI attributes

   o  Monitoring statistics of advertisements exchanged by a PE

   o  Monitoring routing information for multicast destinations

   o  Monitoring next hops for each multicast destination

   To provide these functionalities, BGP-MPLS-LAYER3-VPN-MULTICAST-MIB
   defines the following tables.

   o  mvpnGenericTable

      This table contains generic information about MVPNs on a PE.  Each
      entry in this table represents an instance of an MVPN on a PE and
      contains generic information related to the MVPN.  For each entry
      in this table, there MUST be a corresponding VRF in MPLS-L3VPN-
      STD-MIB [RFC4382].

   o  mvpnBgpTable

      This table contains information specific to BGP-MVPNs.  Each BGP-
      MVPN on a PE will have an entry in this table.

   o  mvpnPmsiTable

      This table contains managed objects representing attribute
      information that is common to I-PMSIs and S-PMSIs on a PE.

   o  mvpnSpmsiTable

      This table contains managed objects representing attribute
      information specific to S-PMSIs.  An S-PMSI represented in this
      table will have a corresponding entry in mvpnPmsiTable.

RFC 8503                  L3 VPN Multicast MIB             December 2018


   o  mvpnAdvtStatsTable

      This table contains statistics pertaining to I-PMSI and S-PMSI
      advertisements sent/received.

   o  mvpnMrouteTable

      This table contains multicast routing information in MVRFs on a
      PE.

   o  mvpnMrouteNextHopTable

      This table contains information on the next hops for routing IP
      multicast datagrams in MVPNs on a PE.

4.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module contains some read-only objects that may be deemed
   sensitive.  It also contains some read-write objects whose settings
   will change the device's MVPN-related behavior.  Appropriate security
   procedures that are related to SNMP in general but are not specific
   to this MIB module need to be implemented by concerned operators.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection opens devices to attack.  These are the tables and objects
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  mvpnSPTunnelLimit

      The value of this object is used to control the maximum number of
      selective provider tunnels that a PE allows for a particular MVPN.
      Access to this object may be abused to impact the performance of
      the PE or prevent the PE from having new selective provider
      tunnels.

   o  mvpnBgpCmcastRouteWithdrawalTimer

      The value of this object is used to control the delay for the
      advertisement of withdrawals of C-multicast routes.  Access to
      this object may be abused to impact the performance of a PE.

   o  mvpnBgpSrcSharedTreeJoinTimer

      The value of this object is used to control the delay for the
      advertisement of Source/Shared Tree Join C-multicast routes.
      Access to this object may be abused to impact the propagation of
      C-multicast routing information.

   o  mvpnBgpMsgRateLimit

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the rate of BGP C-multicast routing information message exchange
      among PEs.  Access to this object may be abused to impact the
      performance of the PE or disrupt the C-multicast routing
      information message exchange using BGP.

RFC 8503                  L3 VPN Multicast MIB             December 2018


   o  mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRoutes

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the number of S-PMSI A-D routes.  Access to this object may be
      abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE from
      receiving S-PMSI A-D routes.

   o  mvpnBgpMaxSpmsiAdRouteFreq

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the frequency of S-PMSI A-D route generation.  Access to this
      object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or
      prevent the PE from generating new S-PMSI A-D routes.

   o  mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRoutes

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the number of Source Active A-D routes.  Access to this object may
      be abused to impact the performance of the PE or prevent the PE
      from receiving Source Active A-D routes.

   o  mvpnBgpMaxSrcActiveAdRouteFreq

      The value of this object is used to control the upper bound for
      the frequency of Source Active A-D route generation.  Access to
      this object may be abused to impact the performance of the PE or
      prevent the PE from generating new Source Active A-D routes.

   Some of the objects in this MIB module may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  This includes INDEX objects
   with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, and any indices from other
   modules exposed via AUGMENTS.  It is thus important to control even
   GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
   network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The address-related objects in this MIB module may have impact on
      privacy and security.  These objects may reveal the locations of
      senders and recipients.

      *  mvpnPmsiTunnelPimGroupAddr

      *  mvpnSpmsiCmcastGroupAddr

      *  mvpnSpmsiCmcastSourceAddr

      *  mvpnAdvtPeerAddr

RFC 8503                  L3 VPN Multicast MIB             December 2018


      *  mvpnMrouteCmcastGroupAddr

      *  mvpnMrouteCmcastSourceAddrs

      *  mvpnMrouteUpstreamNeighborAddr

      *  mvpnMrouteRtAddr

      *  mvpnMrouteNextHopGroupAddr

      *  mvpnMrouteNextHopSourceAddrs

      *  mvpnMrouteNextHopAddr

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the "SMI Network Management MGMT
   Codes Internet-standard MIB" registry:

   Name     Description                        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value

   An earlier draft version of this document was coauthored by Zhaohui
   (Jeffrey) Zhang, Saud Asif, Andy Green, Sameer Gulrajani, and Pradeep
   G. Jain.  That document, in turn, was based on an earlier document
   written by Susheela Vaidya, Thomas D. Nadeau, and Harmen Van der
   Linde.

   This document also borrows heavily from the design and descriptions
   of ipMcastRouteTable and ipMcastRouteNextHopTable from IPMCAST-MIB
   [RFC5132].

   Glenn Mansfield Keeni did the MIB Doctor review and provided valuable
   comments.
