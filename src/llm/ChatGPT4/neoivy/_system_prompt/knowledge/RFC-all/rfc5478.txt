1.  Introduction

   The US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is rolling out their
   Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based architecture at this time.
   This network will require more Resource-Priority namespaces than were
   defined, and IANA registered, in RFC 4412 [RFC4412].  The purpose of
   this document is to define these additional namespaces.  Each will be
   preemptive in nature, as defined in RFC 4412, and will have the same
   10 priority-values.

   DISA has a requirement to be able to assign different Resource-
   Priority namespaces to differing groups of differing sizes throughout
   their networks.  Examples of this may be

   - namespaces as large as each branch of service (Army, Navy, Air
     Force, Marines, Coast Guard)

   - namespaces for some departments within the government (for example,
     Homeland Security)

   - namespaces that are temporary assignments to individual units of
     varying sizes (from battle groups to patrol groups or platoons)

   These temporary assignments might be combinations of smaller units
   involving several branches of service operating as one unit (say, one
   task force, which is separate than the branch of service), or a
   single commando unit requiring special treatment for a short period
   of time, making it appear separate from the branch of service they
   are from.

   Providing DISA with a pool of namespaces for fine-grained
   assignment(s) allows them the flexibility they need for their mission
   requirements.  One can imagine due to their sheer size and separation
   of purpose, they can easily utilize a significant number of
   namespaces within their networks.  This is the reason for the

   assignment of so many new namespaces, which seems to deviate from
   guidance in RFC 4412 to have as few namespaces as possible.

   This document makes no changes to SIP, it just adds IANA-registered
   namespaces for SIP's use within the Resource-Priority header
   framework.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  New SIP Resource-Priority Namespaces Created

   The following 40 SIP namespaces are created by this document:

   dsn-000000      drsn-000000      rts-000000      crts-000000
   dsn-000001      drsn-000001      rts-000001      crts-000001
   dsn-000002      drsn-000002      rts-000002      crts-000002
   dsn-000003      drsn-000003      rts-000003      crts-000003
   dsn-000004      drsn-000004      rts-000004      crts-000004
   dsn-000005      drsn-000005      rts-000005      crts-000005
   dsn-000006      drsn-000006      rts-000006      crts-000006
   dsn-000007      drsn-000007      rts-000007      crts-000007
   dsn-000008      drsn-000008      rts-000008      crts-000008
   dsn-000009      drsn-000009      rts-000009      crts-000009

   Each namespace listed above is wholly different.  However, according
   to the rules within Section 8 of RFC 4412, one or more sets can be
   treated as if they are the same when they are configured as an
   aggregated grouping of namespaces.

   These aggregates of two or more namespaces, that are to be considered
   equivalent during treatment, can be a set of any IANA registered
   namespaces, not just adjacent (i.e., consecutive) namespaces.

RFC 5478            New SIP RPH Namespaces for DISA           March 2009


   Each namespace listed above will have the same 10 priority levels:

      .0 (lowest priority)
      .1
      .2
      .3
      .4
      .5
      .6
      .7
      .8
      .9 (highest priority)

   According to the rules established in RFC 4412 [RFC4412], priority-
   values have a relative order for preferential treatment, unless one
   or more consecutive groups of priority-values are to be considered
   equivalent (i.e., first-received, first treated).

   The dash character ('-') is just like any other ASCII character
   within a namespace, and is not to be considered a delimiter in any
   official way within any namespace here.  Other namespace definitions
   in the future could change this.

   As stated in Section 9 of RFC 4412 [RFC4412] an IANA-registered
   namespace SHOULD NOT change the number, and MUST NOT change the
   relative priority order, of its assigned priority-values.

3.  IANA Considerations

   Abiding by the rules established within RFC 4412 [RFC4412], this is a
   Standards-Track document registering new namespaces, their associated
   priority-values, and intended algorithms.

3.1.  IANA Resource-Priority Namespace Registration

   Within the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" registry in the sip-
   parameters section of IANA, the following table lists the new
   namespaces registered by this document.

3.2.  IANA Priority-Value Registrations

   Within the "Resource-Priority Priority-values" registry in the
   sip-parameters section of IANA, the list of priority-values for each
   of the 40 newly created namespaces from Section 3.1 of this
   document, prioritized least to greatest, is registered by the
   following (replicated similar to the following format):

   Namespace: dsn-000000
   Reference: RFC5478 (this document)
   Priority-Values (least to greatest): "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5",
   "6", "7", "8", "9"

4.  Security Considerations

   This document has the same Security Considerations as RFC 4412.
