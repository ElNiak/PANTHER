                         IANA Registration for
          the Cryptographic Algorithm Object Identifier Range

Abstract

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated by DigiCert, Inc. for the purpose of
   registering the Edwards Elliptic Curve key agreement and signature
   algorithms.  This donated set of OIDs allowed for shorter values than
   would be possible using the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.  This
   document describes the donated range and the identifiers that were
   assigned from that range, transfers control of that range to IANA,
   and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments
   within that range.

1.  Introduction

   When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of
   object identifiers was donated to the working group by DigiCert, Inc.
   The use of these object identifiers allowed for the Edwards Elliptic
   Curve key agreement [RFC7748] and signature [RFC8032] algorithms to
   be defined with encodings that are smaller than similar ones would be
   if assigned from the existing S/MIME or PKIX arcs.  The initial
   registrations from this arc were made while developing [RFC8410].
   After those registrations were made, there were still some unused
   values that could be used by other security groups.

   Object identifiers are primarily used with Abstract Syntax Notation
   (ASN.1) [ASN.1].  The ASN.1 specifications continue to evolve, but
   object identifiers can be used with any and all versions of ASN.1.

   This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in
   that donated range, transfers control of the range to IANA, and
   establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments.

RFC 8411                      OID Registry                   August 2018


   The donated range from DigiCert, Inc. is as follows:

   first: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 100 }
   last: { iso (1) identified-organization (3) thawte (101) 127 }

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the "SMI Security for Cryptographic Algorithms"
   registry within the SMI-numbers registry.  The new registry has three
   columns, as shown below.

     +------------+-------------------------------+-----------------+
     | Decimal    | Description                   | References      |
     +------------+-------------------------------+-----------------+
     | 0-99       | Retained by DigiCert          | RFC 8411        |
     | 100        | Reserved for child reg        | RFC 8411        |
     | 110        | id-X25519                     | [RFC8410]       |
     | 111        | id-X448                       | [RFC8410]       |
     | 112        | id-EdDSA25519                 | [RFC8410]       |
     | 113        | id-EdDSA448                   | [RFC8410]       |
     | 114        | Reserved for id-EdDSA25519-ph | [SAFE-X.509-03] |
     | 115        | Reserved for id-EdDSA448-ph   | [SAFE-X.509-03] |
     | 128 and up | Retained by DigiCert          | RFC 8411        |
     +------------+-------------------------------+-----------------+

            Table 1: SMI Security for Cryptographic Algorithms

   The registration policy is "Specification Required" as defined in
   [RFC8126].

   The column 'Decimal' is required to be a number between 100 and 127
   inclusive.

   The value of 100 has been reserved so that a new arc below that point
   can be established in the future (i.e., starting at 1.3.101.100.1).
   If the new child registry is established, a name for this value is to
   be assigned at that point.  The experts can, at their discretion,
   assign an algorithm OID instead.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new
   security considerations.  The protocols that specify these values
   include the security considerations associated with their usage.

Acknowledgments

   Our thanks go out to DigiCert for donating the range of OIDs covered
   in this document.  At the time of the donation, the root of the range
   was assigned to Symantec but has since been transferred to DigiCert.

   This document uses a lot of text from a similar document by Russ
   Housley.  Copying always makes things easier and less error prone.
