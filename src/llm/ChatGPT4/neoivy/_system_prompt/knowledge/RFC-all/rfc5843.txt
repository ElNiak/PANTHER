          Additional Hash Algorithms for HTTP Instance Digests

Abstract

   The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest
   Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used by
   Instance Digests in HTTP.  Instance Digests in HTTP provide a digest,
   also known as a checksum or hash, of an entire representation of the
   current state of a resource.  This document adds new values to the
   registry and updates previous values.

1.  Introduction

   The IANA registry named "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest
   Algorithm Values" defines values for digest algorithms used by
   Instance Digests in HTTP.

   Note: This is unrelated to HTTP Digest Authentication.  Instance
   Digests in HTTP provide a digest, also known as a checksum or hash,
   of an entire representation of the current state of a resource.

   The registry was created by [RFC3230] in 2002.  This document adds
   new values to the registry and updates previous values that had
   redundant or outdated references.

1.1.  Example

   Example of Instance Digest for SHA-256:

   Digest: SHA-256=MWVkMWQxYTRiMzk5MDQ0MzI3NGU5NDEyZTk5OWY1ZGFmNzgyZTJlO
   DYzYjRjYzFhOTlmNTQwYzI2M2QwM2U2MQ==

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes use of the IANA registry named "Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Digest Algorithm Values" specified in
   [RFC3230].

2.1.  Previous Registrations Updated

   Accordingly, IANA has updated the following registrations:

      Digest Algorithm: MD5

      Description: The MD5 algorithm, as specified in [RFC1321].  The
      output of this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding
      [RFC4648].

      Reference: [RFC1321], [RFC4648], this document.

      Digest Algorithm: SHA

      Description: The SHA-1 algorithm [FIPS-180-3].  The output of this
      algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].

      Reference: [FIPS-180-3], [RFC4648], this document.

2.2.  New Registrations

   Accordingly, IANA has made the following registrations:

      Digest Algorithm: SHA-256

      Description: The SHA-256 algorithm [FIPS-180-3].  The output of
      this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].

      Reference: [FIPS-180-3], [RFC4648], this document.

      Digest Algorithm: SHA-512

      Description: The SHA-512 algorithm [FIPS-180-3].  The output of
      this algorithm is encoded using the base64 encoding [RFC4648].

      Reference: [FIPS-180-3], [RFC4648], this document.

3.  Security Considerations

   Same as [RFC3230].

4.  Changes Compared to RFC 3230

   The reference for base64 encoding has been updated for both MD5 and
   SHA.

   The reference for SHA has been updated.

   The SHA-256 and SHA-512 algorithms have been added to the registry.

   All other previous values to the registry are still valid.
