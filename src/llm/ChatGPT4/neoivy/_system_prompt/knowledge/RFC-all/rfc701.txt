	AUGUST, 1974, SURVEY OF NEW-PROTOCOL TELNET SERVERS

THIS IS THE FIRST OF WHAT ARE PLANNED TO BE MONTHLY REPORTS ON
THE STATUS OF THE NEW-PROTOCOL TELNET IMPLEMENTAIONS ON THE SERVER
HOSTS ON THE ARPA NETWORK.  INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT ARE DATA ONLY
ON SERVER TELNETS AT THE VARIOUS SITES.  ONE WOULD HOPE THAT ANY
SITE WITH AN OPERATIONAL NEW-PROTOCOL SERVER TELNET WOULD ALSO BOAST
A NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNET; WE CAN CERTAINLY ASSUME THIS FOR TENEX
SITES AT WHICH TENEX 1.32 IS OPERATING.  HOWEVER, NO FURTHER CLAIMS
ARE MADE FOR THE SERVER DATA CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

I AM SORRY TO REPORT THAT AT THIS LATE DATE, A MONTH AFTER THE RELEASE
OF TENEX 1.32, LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE SERVER SITES HAVE ANY NEW-
PROTOCOL SERVER OPERATING, ACCORDING TO MY SURVEYS*, AND ONLY HALF
OF THOSE ARE USING CORRECTLY THE LOGGER SOCKET CONVENTIONS, AS I
UNDERSTAND THEM.  AT THE END OF THIS REPORT IS A COMPLETE TABULATION
COMPILED FROM MY SURVEYS;  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY:

	TOTAL SERVER HOSTS		32	100%

	STATUS UNKNOWN (1)		 3	  9%

	NO NEW-PROT SERVER		19	 59%

	TOTAL NEW-PROT IMPLEM.		10	 31%

	  NEW-PROT ON SOCKET 27,
	  OLD ON SOCKET 1 (2)		 5	 16%

 	  NEW-PROT ON 1 AND 27 (3)	 4	 13%

	  NEW-PROT ON 1 ONLY (3)	 1	  3%


NOTES:

*  ALL DATA IN THIS REPORT WERE GATHERED VIA A SURVEYING PROGRAM
   RUN AT VARIOUS TIMES, PLUS A FEW MANUAL CHECKS TO FILL OUT THE
   DATA.  WHAT IS REPORTED HERE IS THE WAY THE VARIOUS SERVERS WORK
   AS SEEN BY THE NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNET AT BBNA, AS OF 15 AUG.
   1974.  THERE MAY BE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THESE RESULTS AND THOSE
   FROM SURVEYS MADE AT OTHER SITES.

(1) NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT TO THESE SITES ALL FAILED DUE TO
   THE SITES' BEING DOWN TO THE NETWORK.

(2) THESE ARE THE SITES WHOSE OPERATION IS 100% CORRECT ACCORDING
   TO ALL PROTOCOLS AND CONVENTIONS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM.

(3) WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE SERVERS THAT APPEAR HERE AS NEW-
   PROTOCOL SERVERS ON SOCKET 1 ARE ACTUALLY SERVERS WHICH ATTEMPT
   TO COMMUNICATE WITH BOTH OLD- AND NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNETS
   ACCORDING TO WHAT CONTROL SEQUENCES ARE RECEIVED.
