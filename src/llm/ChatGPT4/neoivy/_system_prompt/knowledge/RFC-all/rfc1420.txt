Abstract

   This document defines a convention for encapsulating Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP) [1] packets over the transport mechanism
   provided via the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol [2].

1. Introduction

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as defined in [1] is
   now used as an integral part of the network management framework for
   TCP/IP-based internets.  Together with its companion standards, which
   define the Structure of Management Information (SMI) [3,4], and the
   Management Information Base (MIB) [5], the SNMP has received
   widespread deployment in many operational networks running the
   Internet suite of protocols.

   The success of SNMP in the TCP/IP environment has led to its
   deployment in non TCP/IP-based internets. This specification
   describes the mapping of SNMP onto the Internetwork Packet Exchange
   (IPX) protocol [2] used in Novell NetWare environments.

   As noted in [6], the preferred mapping for SNMP is onto UDP [7].  As
   such, this specification is intended for use in environments where
   UDP transport is not available.  No aspect of this specification
   should be construed as a suggestion that, in a heterogeneous
   transport environment, a managed agent should support more than one
   mapping. Conversely, management stations are strongly encouraged to
   support mappings of SNMP onto all popular transports.

2.  Mapping SNMP onto IPX

   Mapping SNMP onto IPX is straight-forward since IPX provides a
   datagram service very similar to that provided by IP/UDP.

RFC 1420                     SNMP over IPX                    March 1993


   Although modifications have been made elsewhere in the NetWare
   protocol suite, IPX is identical to the Xerox Internet Datagram
   Protocol (IDP) [8].  The socket address space authority is
   administered by Novell.

   SNMP packets will always set the Packet Type field in the IPX header
   to 4 (i.e., Packet Exchange Packet).

2.1  Socket Assignments

   SNMP protocol entities will receive GetRequest-PDU, GetNextRequest-
   PDU, and SetRequest-PDU messages on socket 36879 (Destination Socket
   field set to hexadecimal 900F), and Trap-PDU messages on socket 36880
   (Destination Socket field set to hexadecimal 9010).

   GetResponse-PDU messages will be addressed to the IPX address and
   socket from which the corresponding GetRequest-PDU, GetNextRequest-
   PDU, or SetRequest-PDU originated.

2.2  Traps

   When SNMP traps are sent over IPX, the agent-addr field in the Trap-
   PDU contains the IP-address "0.0.0.0".  An SNMP manager may ascertain
   the source of the trap based on information provided by the transport
   service

2.3  Maximum Message Size

   Although SNMP does not require conformant implementations to accept
   messages whose length exceeds 484 bytes, it is recommended that
   implementations support a maximum SNMP message size of 546 bytes (the
   maximum size allowed under IPX).  Furthermore, this limit is the
   maximum packet length guaranteed to traverse IPX routers which do not
   provide fragmentation.  Implementors may choose to use longer packet
   lengths if the maximum is known, which depends on the intermediate
   routers and/or intermediate datalink layer protocols.
