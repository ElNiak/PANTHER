                      RFC 3627 to Historic Status

Abstract

   This document moves "Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers
   Considered Harmful" (RFC 3627) to Historic status to reflect the
   updated guidance contained in "Using 127-Bit IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-
   Router Links" (RFC 6164).  A Standards Track document supersedes an
   informational document; therefore, guidance provided in RFC 6164 is
   to be followed when the two documents are in conflict.  This document
   links the two RFCs so that the IETF's updated guidance on this topic
   is clearer.

1.  Introduction

   This document moves "Use of /127 Prefix Length Between Routers
   Considered Harmful" [RFC3627] to Historic status in accordance with
   RFC 2026 [RFC2026].  RFC 3627 has been superseded by "Using 127-Bit
   IPv6 Prefixes on Inter-Router Links" [RFC6164].  A Standards Track
   document supersedes an informational document; therefore, guidance
   provided in RFC 6164 is to be followed when the two documents are in
   conflict.  This may not have been clear to casual readers who are not
   familiar with the differences in IETF document types.  This document
   adds the necessary link between the two RFCs so that users referring
   to RFC 3627 for guidance will see that it has been obsoleted by
   updated guidance on the matter, thus hopefully eliminating any
   confusion that may be present.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations.

3.  Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Brian Carpenter, Bob Hinden, and Ron Bonica for guidance on
   the matter, and to Pekka Savola and Miya Kohno and the other authors
   of 6164 for their support.
