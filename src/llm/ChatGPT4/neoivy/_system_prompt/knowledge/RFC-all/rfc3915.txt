Abstract

   This document describes an Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
   extension mapping for the management of Domain Name System (DNS)
   domain names subject to "grace period" policies defined by the
   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).  Grace
   period policies exist to allow protocol actions to be reversed or
   otherwise revoked during a short period of time after the protocol
   action has been performed.  Specified in XML, this mapping extends
   the EPP domain name mapping to provide additional features required
   for grace period processing.

RFC 3915                EPP Grace Period Mapping          September 2004


1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) described in RFC 3730 [1].
   This mapping, an extension of the domain name mapping described in
   RFC 3731 [2], is specified using the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   1.0 [3] and XML Schema notation ([4], [5]).

   The EPP core protocol specification [1] provides a complete
   description of EPP command and response structures.  A thorough
   understanding of the base protocol specification is necessary to
   understand the mapping described in this document.

   Over the course of several months in 2002, The Internet Corporation
   for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) developed an implementation
   proposal to provide a "grace period" for Domain Name System (DNS)
   domain name recovery (or redemption) before a domain name is purged
   from the repository of the authoritative registry for the domain
   name.  This mapping extends the EPP domain <update> command to
   initiate the redemption process for a domain name that has entered
   the Redemption Grace Period (RGP) and it extends the EPP domain
   <info> response to identify the status of domains that have entered
   various grace periods defined by ICANN policy.

   In March 2003, ICANN published a task force report describing other
   domain registry grace periods related to EPP operations.  This
   mapping describes extension status values to note the grace periods
   described in the report, including:

   o  An "add grace period" after the initial registration of a domain
      name.  If the domain name is deleted by the registrar during this
      period, the registry provides a credit to the registrar for the
      cost of the registration.

   o  An "auto-renew grace period" after a domain name registration
      period expires and is extended (renewed) automatically by the
      registry.  If the domain name is deleted by the registrar during
      this period, the registry provides a credit to the registrar for
      the cost of the renewal.

   o  A "renew grace period" after a domain name registration period is
      explicitly extended (renewed) by the registrar.  If the domain
      name is deleted by the registrar during this period, the registry
      provides a credit to the registrar for the cost of the renewal.

RFC 3915                EPP Grace Period Mapping          September 2004


   o  A "transfer grace period" after the successful transfer of domain
      name registration sponsorship from one registrar to another
      registrar.  If the domain name is deleted by the new sponsoring
      registrar during this period, the registry provides a credit to
      the registrar for the cost of the transfer.

   Each grace period exists for a specific period of time that is
   typically measured in days.  The duration of each grace period is a
   matter of registry operational policy that is not addressed in this
   document.

1.1.  Conventions Used In This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [6].

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples is provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and is not a REQUIRED feature of this specification.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

2.  Redemption Grace Period State Diagram

   The Redemption Grace Period (RGP) involves several domain state
   transitions as a domain name moves through the redemption process:

   1.  A domain is initially in the EPP "ok" status, or some other
       status that allows processing of the EPP <delete> command.

   2.  A <delete> command is received and processed for the domain name.

   3.  RGP begins once the <delete> command is processed successfully.
       The EPP status changes to "pendingDelete", and the RGP status is
       initialized to "redemptionPeriod".  The domain remains in this
       state until either a <restore> operation is requested or the
       redemption period elapses.

   4.  A <restore> operation can be requested using the extended EPP
       <update> command.  Go to step 8 if the redemption period elapses
       before a <restore> request is received.

RFC 3915                EPP Grace Period Mapping          September 2004


   5.  If the <restore> is successful, the Registry waits to receive a
       restore report from the registrar for a period of time defined by
       the Registry.  The EPP status remains "pendingDelete" and the RGP
       status changes to "pendingRestore".  While this extension defines
       a method to deliver a restore report via EPP, an out-of-band
       mechanism (such as a web site) can also be used to deliver
       restore reports.

   6.  The domain name returns to the redemption period state (state 3)
       if a restore report is not received.

   7.  If a restore report is received the EPP status returns to "ok"
       (or whatever it was prior to processing the <delete> command),
       and the RGP status is removed completely.

   8.  The redemption period elapses before a <restore> request is
       received.

   9.  The EPP status remains "pendingDelete" and the RGP status changes
       to "pendingDelete".  The domain name remains in this state for a
       period of time defined by the Registry.

   10. The domain name is purged once the pending delete period elapses.

   11. The domain name is available for re-registration.

3.  Object Attributes

   This extension adds additional elements to the EPP domain name
   mapping [2].  Only new element descriptions are described here.

3.1.  Status Values

   This extension defines new status values to represent the different
   states that a domain name can be in as a result of grace period
   processing.  These are:

   addPeriod: This grace period is provided after the initial
      registration of a domain name.  If the domain name is deleted by
      the registrar during this period, the registry provides a credit
      to the registrar for the cost of the registration.

   autoRenewPeriod: This grace period is provided after a domain
      name registration period expires and is extended (renewed)
      automatically by the registry.  If the domain name is deleted by
      the registrar during this period, the registry provides a credit
      to the registrar for the cost of the renewal.

RFC 3915                EPP Grace Period Mapping          September 2004


   renewPeriod: This grace period is provided after a domain name
      registration period is explicitly extended (renewed) by the
      registrar.  If the domain name is deleted by the registrar during
      this period, the registry provides a credit to the registrar for
      the cost of the renewal.

   transferPeriod: This grace period is provided after the
      successful transfer of domain name registration sponsorship from
      one registrar to another registrar.  If the domain name is deleted
      by the new sponsoring registrar during this period, the registry
      provides a credit to the registrar for the cost of the transfer.

   redemptionPeriod: This status value is used to describe a
      domain for which a <delete> command has been received, but the
      domain has not yet been purged because an opportunity exists to
      restore the domain and abort the deletion process.

   pendingRestore: This status value is used to describe a domain that
      is in the process of being restored after being in the
      redemptionPeriod state.

   pendingDelete: This status value is used to describe a domain that
      has entered the purge processing state after completing the
      redemptionPeriod state.  A domain in this status MUST also be in
      the pendingDelete status described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

3.2.  Registration Data and Supporting Information

   This extension allows a client to provide copies of registration data
   (whois [9] data, for example) and supporting information in a restore
   report as required by the RGP process.  No specific format is
   required by this extension; both free text and XML markup MAY be
   used.

   Operators of servers that provide registration data might find it
   useful to provide grace period status values in their responses to
   client queries.  This information can be useful to people who want to
   understand the operations that can be performed on a domain name at
   any give time.

3.3.  Dates and Times

   Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Universal
   Coordinated Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using upper case "T" and "Z" characters defined in RFC
   3339 [7] MUST be used to represent date-time values as XML Schema
   does not support truncated date-time forms or lower case "T" and "Z"
   characters.

RFC 3915                EPP Grace Period Mapping          September 2004


3.4.  Client Statements

   The RGP process requires a client to make two statements regarding
   the data included in a restore report.  No specific format is
   required by this extension; both free text and XML markup MAY be
   used.  English is the default language used within the statements,
   but other languages MAY be used.

4.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [1].  The command mappings
   described here are specifically for use in implementing redemption
   grace period processes via EPP.

4.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve object information: <check>
   to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to retrieve
   detailed information associated with an object, and <transfer> to
   retrieve object transfer status information.

4.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <check> command
   or <check> response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [2].  Additional elements are
   defined for the <info> response.

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain child elements as described in [2]. In
   addition, the EPP <extension> element MUST contain a child
   <rgp:infData> element that identifies the registry grace period
   namespace and the location of the registry grace period schema.  The
   <rgp:infData> element contains a single <rgp:rgpStatus> element that
   contains a single attribute "s" whose value describes the current
   grace period status of the domain.  Possible status values are
   described in section Section 3.1.

4.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP domain mapping
   [2].

4.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.

4.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <create> command
   or <create> response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <delete> command
   or <delete> response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <renew> command
   or <renew> response described in the EPP domain mapping [2].

4.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP domain mapping
   [2].

4.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <update>
   command and response described in the EPP domain mapping [2] for
   redemption grace period processing.

   The EPP <update> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to change the state of a domain object.  The registry grace
   period extension modifies base update processing to support
   redemption of domain names for which a <delete> command has been
   processed, but the name has not yet been purged.

   Section 3.2.5 of the EPP domain mapping describes the elements that
   have to be specified within an <update> command.  The requirement to
   provide at least one <domain:add>, <domain:rem>, or <domain:chg>
   element is updated by this extension such that at least one empty
   <domain:add>, <domain:rem>, or <domain:chg> element MUST be present
   if this extension is specified within an <update> command.  This
   requirement is updated to disallow the possibility of modifying a
   domain object as part of redemption grace period recovery processing.

   In addition to the EPP command elements described in the EPP domain
   mapping [2], the <update> command MUST contain an <extension>
   element.  The <extension> element MUST contain a child <rgp:update>
   element that identifies the registry grace period namespace and the
   location of the registry grace period schema.  The <rgp:update>

   element contains a single <rgp:restore> element that contains an
   OPTIONAL <rgp:report> element that MAY be used to deliver a
   redemption grace period restore report.

   The <rgp:restore> element contains a REQUIRED "op" attribute that
   describes the redemption grace period operation being requested.  Two
   values are defined: "request" is used to identify a restore request
   that does not include a restore report, and "report" is used to
   identify a restore request that contains a restore report.  A report
   MAY be submitted more than once if corrections are required.  If the
   value of the "op" attribute is "request" an <rgp:report> element MUST
   NOT be present.  If the value of the "op" attribute is "report" an
   <rgp:report> element MUST be present.

   The <rgp:report> element contains the following child elements:

   -  An <rgp:preData> element that contains a copy of the registration
      data that existed for the domain name prior to the domain name
      being deleted.  This element MAY contain both text and XML markup.

   -  An <rgp:postData> element that contains a copy of the registration
      data that exists for the domain name at the time the restore
      report is submitted.  This element MAY contain both text and XML
      markup.

   -  An <rgp:delTime> element that contains the date and time when the
      domain name delete request was sent to the server.

   -  An <rgp:resTime> element that contains the date and time when the
      original <rgp:restore> command was sent to the server.

   -  An <rgp:resReason> element that contains a brief explanation of
      the reason for restoring the domain name.

   -  An <rgp:statement> element that contains a text statement that the
      client has not restored the domain name in order to assume the
      rights to use or sell the domain name for itself or for any third
      party.  Supporting information related to this statement MAY be
      supplied in the <rgp:other> element described below.  An OPTIONAL
      "lang" attribute MAY be present to identify the language if
      English (value "en") is not used to represent the statement.

   -  A second <rgp:statement> element that contains a text statement
      that the information in the restore report is factual to the best
      of the client's knowledge.  An OPTIONAL "lang" attribute MAY be
      present to identify the language if English (value "en") is not
      used to represent the statement.

   -  An OPTIONAL <rgp:other> element that contains any information
      needed to support the statements provided by the client.  This
      element MAY contain both text and XML markup.

   More detailed information describing the information required to be
   provided in a restore report is available from ICANN.

   When an extended <update> command without a restore report has been
   processed successfully, the EPP response is as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [2] except that an extension element is added to
   describe grace period status as a result of processing the <update>
   command.  The extension element contains a single child element
   (<upData>) that itself contains a single child element (<rgpStatus>)
   that contains a single attribute "s" whose value MUST be
   "pendingRestore" if the <restore> request has been accepted.

   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

   When an extended <update> command with a restore report has been
   processed successfully, the EPP response is as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [2] with no registry grace period extension.  Registry
   grace period extension is not required because acceptance of the
   restore report completes redemption grace period processing.

5.  Formal Syntax

   An EPP object mapping is specified in XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation of
   the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding
   information using the Unicode character set and its more compact
   representations including UTF-8 [10].  Conformant XML processors
   recognize both UTF-8 and UTF-16 [11].  Though XML includes provisions
   to identify and use other character encodings through use of an
   "encoding" attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use of UTF-8 is
   RECOMMENDED in environments where parser encoding support
   incompatibility exists.

   As an extension of the EPP domain mapping [2], the elements, element
   content, attributes, and attribute values described in this document
   MUST inherit the internationalization conventions used to represent
   higher-layer domain and core protocol structures present in an XML
   instance that includes this extension.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in RFC 3688 [8].  Two
   URI assignments were requested and have been registered by the IANA.

   Registration request for the registry grace period namespace:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:rgp-1.0

   Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this
   document.

   XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the registry grace period XML schema:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:rgp-1.0

   Registrant Contact: See the "Author's Address" section of this

8.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [1], the EPP domain
   name mapping [2], and protocol layers used by EPP.  The security
   considerations described in these other specifications apply to this
   specification as well.

   As with other domain object updates, redemption of a deleted domain
   object MUST be restricted to the sponsoring client as authenticated
   using the mechanisms described in sections 2.9.1.1 and 7 of RFC 3730
   [1].  Any attempt to recover a deleted domain object by any client
   other than the sponsoring client MUST be rejected with an appropriate
   EPP authorization error.
