RFC 5179              Kerberos Domain-Based Names               May 2008


1.  Domain-Based Names for the Kerberos V GSS-API Mechanism

   In accordance with [RFC5178], this document provides the mechanism-
   specific details needed to implement GSS-API [RFC2743] domain-based
   service names with the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121].

   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE name SHOULD be mapped to Kerberos V
   principal names as follows:

   o  the <service> name becomes the first (0th) component of the
      Kerberos V principal name;

   o  the <hostname> becomes the second component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;

   o  the <domain> name becomes the third component of the Kerberos V
      principal name;

   o  the realm of the resulting principal name is that which
      corresponds to the domain name, treated as a hostname.

   The same name canonicalization considerations and methods as used
   elsewhere in the Kerberos V GSS-API mechanism [RFC4121] and Kerberos
   V [RFC4120] in general apply here.

   Implementations SHOULD use a Kerberos V name-type of
   NTT-SRVT-HST-DOMAIN (which has the value 12) but MAY use NT-UNKNOWN
   instead.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Internationalization Considerations

   It is unclear, at this time, how best to address internationalization
   of Kerberos V domain-based principal names.  This is because the
   Kerberos V core protocol internationalization project is incomplete.

   However, clearly the best way to interoperate when using Kerberos V
   domain-based principal names is to use ACE-encoded internationalized
   domain names [RFC3490] for the hostname and domain name slots of a
   Kerberos V domain-based principal name.  Therefore Kerberos V GSS-API
   mechanism implementations MUST do just that.

4.  Examples

   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,
      "ldap@foo.example@ds1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "ldap/ds1.foo.example/
      foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE"

   o  The domain-based name, of generic form,
      "kadmin@foo.example@kdc1.foo.example" may map to a Kerberos V
      principal name like: "kadmin/kdc1.foo.example/
      foo.example@FOO.EXAMPLE"

5.  Security Considerations

   See [RFC5178].

   It is important for the security of protocols using the Kerberos V
   GSS-API mechanism and domain-based names, that the realm of domain-
   based principal names be derived from the hostname, rather than the
   domain name slots of the input domain-based name string.
