1.  Introduction

   Globus (https://www.globus.org) is a software-as-a-service provider
   that develops and operates services and tools for the global research
   and education community.

   Globus provides multiple services for users across many institutions,
   primarily for research driven by high-performance computing.  Globus
   creates unique identifiers that will persist in external systems and
   must be identifiable as references to Globus entities.

   To address this need, this document requests that a formal URN space
   type be assigned as described in Section 4.3 of [RFC3406].

2.  Specification Template

   Namespace ID:

      globus

   Registration Information:

      Version 1
      Date: 2016-03-18

   Declared Registrant of the Namespace:

      Globus Project Lead
      401 N Michigan Ave
      Suite 900
      Chicago, Illinois  60611
      USA

      Email:  tuecke@globus.org

      The position of Globus Project Lead is currently filled by Steve
      Tuecke.

   Declaration of Syntactic Structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
      "globus" NID shall have the following structure:

      <URN> ::= "urn:" "globus" ":" <NSS>

      <NSS> ::= <SNID> | <SNID> ":" <subnamespace-specific-string>

      <SNID> ::= 1*<non-colon-chars>

      <subnamespace-specific-string> ::= 1*<URN chars>

      <non-colon-chars> ::= <non-colon-trans> | "%" <hex> <hex>

      <non-colon-trans> ::= <upper> | <lower> | <number> |
                            <non-colon-other>

      <non-colon-other> ::= "(" | ")" | "+" | "," | "-" | "." | "=" |
                            "@" | ";" | "$" | "_" | "!" | "*" | "'"

      The "SNID" is the top-level segment of the NSS.  It is a required
      US-ASCII string, subject to the above syntax, that conforms to the
      URN syntax requirements (see [RFC2141]).  It identifies a category

      of Globus entities, often associated with a particular Globus
      service.  For example "auth" could be used as an SNID for
      identifiers generated by the Globus authentication and
      authorization service (Globus Auth).

      The "subnamespace-specific-string" is an optional US-ASCII string
      and second-level segment of the NSS, belonging to the "SNID"
      context, subject to the above syntax and conformant to the URN
      syntax requirements (see [RFC2141]).  "subnamespace-specific-
      string" identifies a category of thing within that Globus service,
      such as "scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all"

   Relevant Ancillary Documentation:

      None.

   Identifier Uniqueness Considerations:

      Identifier uniqueness will be enforced by the Globus Project Lead.
      The Globus Project Lead may sub-delegate part of the namespace to
      third parties.  It will not be permissible, neither by the Globus
      Project Lead nor any third party, to reassign previously assigned
      URNs.  A practical consequence is that a previously assigned
      subnamespace cannot be reassigned, unless additional arrangements
      are made to prevent identifier reassignments.

   Identifier Persistence Considerations:

      Identifiers will never be reassigned, but in some circumstances
      they may be invalidated by the Globus Project Lead or by a third
      party.

   Process of Identifier Assignment:

      Assignment of subnamespace identifiers is limited to the Globus
      Project Lead and those authorities that are specifically
      designated by the Globus Project Lead.  The Globus Project Lead
      may assign portions of the globus namespace (specifically, those
      under designated subnamespace identifiers) for assignment by third
      parties.

   Process of Identifier Resolution:

      None currently.

      Future versions of this document may define resources that can be
      used to resolve Globus identifiers.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No additional rules beyond those specified in RFC 2141.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation Mechanism:

      None currently.

      Future versions of this document may define resources that can be
      used to validate Globus identifiers.

   Scope:

      Global.

3.  Examples (Informative)

   The following examples are based on plans for the Globus URN.  They
   are therefore not guaranteed to be valid.

   The Globus Auth service defines the "auth" SNID and contains the
   following URNs:

   o  urn:globus:auth:scope:transfer.api.globus.org:all

   o  urn:globus:auth:grants:dependent_token

   A hypothetical service, the Globus Groups service, would have a
   distinct SNID.  If that SNID were "groups", it might have URNs such
   as the following:

   o  urn:globus:groups:group:669b572e-9de4-11e5-966e-3c970e0c9cc4

   o  urn:globus:groups:memberships:72e1c6c6-9de4-11e5-966e-3c970e0c9cc4

4.  Namespace Considerations

   The current set of existing IANA namespaces are insufficient because
   Globus will be creating unique identifiers that will persist in the
   external system; these identifiers must be identifiable as references
   to Globus entities.

RFC 7853               A URN Namespace for Globus               May 2016


   The use of the Globus namespace is expected to be broad, including
   but not limited to usage for:

   o  OAuth2 scopes (see [RFC6749])

   o  OAuth2 custom extension grants

   o  Entity identification for Globus Services

5.  Community Considerations

   Members of the Globus community will benefit from persistent and
   globally unique identifiers for use in software and in conformance
   with protocols developed and used by Globus and third-party
   collaborators.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no special meanings for characters in the NSS.  Thus, there
   are no additional security considerations other than those normally
   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general, which are
   described in [RFC1737] and [RFC2141].

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the "globus" namespace identifier (NID) in the
   "Formal URN Namespaces" registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.
