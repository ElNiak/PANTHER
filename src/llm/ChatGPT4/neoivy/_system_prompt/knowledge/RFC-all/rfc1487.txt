              X.500 Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The protocol described in this document is designed to provide access
   to the Directory while not incurring the resource requirements of the
   Directory Access Protocol (DAP). This protocol is specifically
   targeted at simple management applications and browser applications
   that provide simple read/write interactive access to the Directory,
   and is intended to be a complement to the DAP itself.

   Key aspects of LDAP are:

   - Protocol elements are carried directly over TCP or other transport,
     bypassing much of the session/presentation overhead.

   - Many protocol data elements are encoding as ordinary strings (e.g.,
     Distinguished Names).

   - A lightweight BER encoding is used to encode all protocol elements.

1.  History

   The tremendous interest in X.500 [1,2] technology in the Internet has
   lead to efforts to reduce the high "cost of entry" associated with
   use of the technology, such as the Directory Assistance Service [3]
   and DIXIE [4]. While efforts such as these have met with success,
   they have been solutions based on particular implementations and as
   such have limited applicability.  This document continues the efforts
   to define Directory protocol alternatives but departs from previous
   efforts in that it consciously avoids dependence on particular

   implementations.

2.  Protocol Model

   The general model adopted by this protocol is one of clients
   performing protocol operations against servers. In this model, this
   is accomplished by a client transmitting a protocol request
   describing the operation to be performed to a server, which is then
   responsible for performing the necessary operations on the Directory.
   Upon completion of the necessary operations, the server returns a
   response containing any results or errors to the requesting client.
   In keeping with the goal of easing the costs associated with use of
   the Directory, it is an objective of this protocol to minimize the
   complexity of clients so as to facilitate widespread deployment of
   applications capable of utilizing the Directory.

   Note that, although servers are required to return responses whenever
   such responses are defined in the protocol, there is no requirement
   for synchronous behavior on the part of either client or server
   implementations: requests and responses for multiple operations may
   be exchanged by client and servers in any order, as long as clients
   eventually receive a response for every request that requires one.

   Consistent with the model of servers performing protocol operations
   on behalf of clients, it is also to be noted that protocol servers
   are expected to handle referrals without resorting to the return of
   such referrals to the client. This protocol makes no provisions for
   the return of referrals to clients, as the model is one of servers
   ensuring the performance of all necessary operations in the
   Directory, with only final results or errors being returned by
   servers to clients.

   Note that this protocol can be mapped to a strict subset of the
   directory abstract service, so it can be cleanly provided by the DAP.

3.  Mapping Onto Transport Services

   This protocol is designed to run over connection-oriented, reliable
   transports, with all 8 bits in an octet being significant in the data
   stream.  Specifications for two underlying services are defined here,
   though others are also possible.

3.1.  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

   The LDAPMessage PDUs are mapped directly onto the TCP bytestream.
   Server implementations running over the TCP should provide a protocol
   listener on port 389.

3.2.  Connection Oriented Transport Service (COTS)

   The connection is established.  No special special use of T-Connect
   is made.  Each LDAPMessage PDU is mapped directly onto T-Data.

4.  Elements of Protocol

   For the purposes of protocol exchanges, all protocol operations are
   encapsulated in a common envelope, the LDAPMessage, which is defined
   as follows:

     LDAPMessage ::=
         SEQUENCE {
              messageID      MessageID,
              protocolOp     CHOICE {
                                  bindRequest         BindRequest,
                                  bindResponse        BindResponse,
                                  unbindRequest       UnbindRequest
                                  searchRequest       SearchRequest,
                                  searchResponse      SearchResponse,
                                  modifyRequest       ModifyRequest,
                                  modifyResponse      ModifyResponse,
                                  addRequest          AddRequest,
                                  addResponse         AddResponse,
                                  delRequest          DelRequest,
                                  delResponse         DelResponse,
                                  modifyRDNRequest    ModifyRDNRequest,
                                  modifyRDNResponse   ModifyRDNResponse,
                                  compareDNRequest    CompareRequest,
                                  compareDNResponse   CompareResponse,
                                  abandonRequest      AbandonRequest
                             }
         }

     MessageID ::= INTEGER (0 .. MaxInt)

   The function of the LDAPMessage is to provide an envelope containing
   common fields required in all protocol exchanges. At this time the
   only common field is a message ID, which is required to have a value
   different from the values of any other requests outstanding in the
   LDAP session of which this message is a part.

   The message ID value must be echoed in all LDAPMessage envelopes
   encapsulting responses corresponding to the request contained in the
   LDAPMessage in which the message ID value was originally used.

   In addition to the LDAPMessage defined above, the following
   definitions are also used in defining protocol operations:

     IA5String ::= OCTET STRING

   The IA5String is a notational convenience to indicate that, although
   strings of IA5String type encode as OCTET STRING types, the legal
   character set in such strings is limited to the IA5 character set.

     LDAPDN ::= IA5String

     RelativeLDAPDN ::= IA5String

   An LDAPDN and a RelativeLDAPDN are respectively defined to be the
   representation of a Distinguished Name and a Relative Distinguished
   Name after encoding according to the specification in [5], such that

     <distinguished-name> ::= <name>

     <relative-distinguished-name> ::= <name-component>

   where <name> and <name-component> are as defined in [5].

     AttributeValueAssertion ::=
         SEQUENCE {
              attributeType       AttributeType
              attributeValue      AttributeValue
         }

   The AttributeValueAssertion type definition  is similar to the one in
   the Directory standards.

     AttributeType ::= IA5String

     AttributeValue ::= OCTET STRING

   An AttributeType value takes on as its value the textual string
   associated with that AttributeType in the Directory standards. For
   example, the AttributeType 'organizationName' with object identifier
   2.5.4.10 is represented as an AttributeType in this protocol by the
   string "organizationName".  In the event that a protocol
   implementation encounters an Attribute Type with which it cannot
   associate a textual string, an ASCII string encoding of the object
   identifier associated with the Attribute Type may be subsitituted.
   For example, the organizationName AttributeType may be represented by
   the ASCII string "2.5.4.10" if a protocol implementation is unable to
   associate the string "organizationName" with it.

   A field of type AttributeValue takes on as its value an octet string
   encoding of a Directory AttributeValue type. The definition of these
   string encodings for different Directory AttributeValue types may be

   found in companions to this document that define the encodings of
   various attribute syntaxes such as [6].

     LDAPResult ::=
         SEQUENCE {
             resultCode    ENUMERATED {

             matchedDN     LDAPDN,
             errorMessage  IA5String
         }

   The LDAPResult is the construct used in this protocol to return
   success or failure indications from servers to clients. In response
   to various requests, servers will return responses containing fields



Yeong, Howes & Kille                                            [Page 5]

RFC 1487                       X.500 LDAP                      July 1993


   of type LDAPResult to indicate the final status of a protocol
   operation request.  The errorMessage field of this construct may, at
   the servers option, be used to return an ASCII string containing a
   textual, human-readable error diagnostic. As this error diagnostic is
   not standardized, implementations should not rely on the values
   returned.  If the server chooses not to return a textual diagnostic,
   the errorMessage field of the LDAPResult type should contain a zero
   length string.

   For resultCodes of noSuchObject, aliasProblem, invalidDNSyntax,
   isLeaf, and aliasDereferencingProblem, the matchedDN field is set to
   the name of the lowest entry (object or alias) in the DIT that was
   matched and is a truncated form of the name provided or, if an alias
   has been dereferenced, of the resulting name.  The matchedDN field
   should be set to NULL DN (a zero length string) in all other cases.

4.1.  Bind Operation

   The function of the Bind Operation is to initiate a protocol session
   between a client and a server, and to allow the authentication of the
   client to the server. The Bind Operation must be the first operation
   request received by a server from a client in a protocol session.
   The Bind Request is defined as follows:

     BindRequest ::=
         [APPLICATION 0] SEQUENCE {
                             version   INTEGER (1 .. 127),
                             name      LDAPDN,
                             authentication CHOICE {
                                  simple        [0] OCTET STRING,
                                  krbv42LDAP    [1] OCTET STRING,
                                  krbv42DSA     [2] OCTET STRING
                             }
         }

   Parameters of the Bind Request are:

   - version: A version number indicating the version of the protocol to
     be used in this protocol session.  This document describes version
     2 of the LDAP protocol.  Note that there is no version negotiation,
     and the client should just set this parameter to the version it
     desires.

   - name: The name of the Directory object that the client wishes to
     bind as.  This field may take on a null value (a zero length
     string) for the purposes of anonymous binds.

   - authentication: information used to authenticate the name, if any,



Yeong, Howes & Kille                                            [Page 6]

     provided in the Bind Request. The "simple" authentication option
     provides minimal authentication facilities, with the contents of
     the authentication field consisting only of a cleartext password.
     This option should also be used when unauthenticated or anonymous
     binds are to be performed, with the field containing a zero length
     string in such cases. Kerberos version 4 [7] authentication to the
     LDAP server and the DSA is accomplished by using the "krbv42LDAP"
     and "krbv42DSA" authentication options, respectively.  Note that
     though they are referred to as separate entities here, there is no
     requirement these two entities be distinct (i.e., a DSA could speak
     LDAP directly).  Two separate authentication options are provided
     to support all implementations.  Each octet string should contain
     the kerberos ticket (e.g., as returned by krb_mk_req()) for the
     appropriate service.  The suggested service name for authentication
     to the LDAP server is "ldapserver".  The suggested service name for
     authentication to the DSA is "x500dsa".  In both cases, the
     suggested instance name for the service is the name of the host
     on which the service is running.  Of course, the actual service
     names and instances will depend on what is entered in the local
     kerberos principle database.

   The Bind Operation requires a response, the Bind Response, which is
   defined as:

     BindResponse ::= [APPLICATION 1] LDAPResult

   A Bind Response consists simply of an indication from the server of
   the status of the client's request for the initiation of a protocol
   session.

   Upon receipt of a Bind Request, a protocol server will authenticate
   the requesting client if necessary, and attempt to set up a protocol
   session with that client. The server will then return a Bind Response
   to the client indicating the status of the session setup request.

4.2.  Unbind Operation

   The function of the Unbind Operation is to terminate a protocol
   session.  The Unbind Operation is defined as follows:

     UnbindRequest ::= [APPLICATION 2] NULL

   The Unbind Operation has no response defined. Upon transmission of an
   UnbindRequest, a protocol client may assume that the protocol session
   is terminated. Upon receipt of an UnbindRequest, a protocol server
   may assume that the requesting client has terminated the session and
   that all outstanding requests may be discarded.

4.3.  Search Operation

   The Search Operation allows a client to request that a search be
   performed on its behalf by a server. The Search Request is defined as
   follows:

     SearchRequest ::=
         [APPLICATION 3] SEQUENCE {
             baseObject    LDAPDN,
             scope         ENUMERATED {
                                baseObject            (0),
                                singleLevel           (1),
                                wholeSubtree          (2)
                           },
             derefAliases  ENUMERATED {
                                        neverDerefAliases     (0),
                                        derefInSearching      (1),
                                        derefFindingBaseObj   (2),
                                        derefAlways           (3)
                                   },
             sizeLimit     INTEGER (0 .. MaxInt),
             timeLimit     INTEGER (0 .. MaxInt),
             attrsOnly     BOOLEAN,
             filter        Filter,
             attributes    SEQUENCE OF AttributeType
     }

     Filter ::=
         CHOICE {
             and                [0] SET OF Filter,
             or                 [1] SET OF Filter,
             not                [2] Filter,
             equalityMatch      [3] AttributeValueAssertion,

         }

   Parameters of the Search Request are:

   - baseObject: An LDAPDN that is the base object entry relative to
     which the search is to be performed.

   - scope: An indicator of the scope of the search to be performed. The
     semantics of the possible values of this field are identical to the
     semantics of the scope field in the Directory Search Operation.

   - derefAliases: An indicator as to how alias objects should be handled
     in searching.  The semantics of the possible values of this
     field are, in order of increasing value:

             neverDerefAliases: do not dereference aliases in searching
             or in locating the base object of the search;

             derefInSearching: dereference aliases in subordinates of
             the base object in searching, but not in locating the
             base object of the search;

             derefFindingBaseObject: dereference aliases in locating
             the base object of the search, but not when searching
             subordinates of the base object;

             derefAlways: dereference aliases both in searching and in
             locating the base object of the search.

   - sizelimit: A sizelimit that restricts the maximum number of entries
     to be returned as a result of the search. A value of 0 in this
     field indicates that no sizelimit restrictions are in effect for
     the search.

   - timelimit: A timelimit that restricts the maximum time (in seconds)
     allowed for a search. A value of 0 in this field indicates that no
     timelimit restrictions are in effect for the search.

   - attrsOnly: An indicator as to whether search results should contain
     both attribute types and values, or just attribute types.  Setting
     this field to TRUE causes only attribute types (no values) to be
     returned.  Setting this field to FALSE causes both attribute types
     and values to be returned.

   - filter: A filter that defines the conditions that must be fulfilled
     in order for the search to match a given entry.

   - attributes: A list of the attributes from each entry found as a

RFC 1487                       X.500 LDAP                      July 1993


     result of the search to be returned. An empty list signifies that
     all attributes from each entry found in the search are to be
     returned.

   The results of the search attempted by the server upon receipt of a
   Search Request are returned in Search Responses, defined as follows:

 Search Response ::=
     CHOICE {
          entry          [APPLICATION 4] SEQUENCE {
                              objectName     LDAPDN,
                              attributes     SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
                                                  AttributeType,
                                                  SET OF AttributeValue
                                             }
                         },
          resultCode     [APPLICATION 5] LDAPResult
      }

   Upon receipt of a Search Request, a server will perform the necessary
   search of the DIT.

   The server will return to the client a sequence of responses
   comprised of:

   - Zero or more Search Responses each consisting of an entry found
     during the search; with the response sequence terminated by

   - A single Search Response containing an indication of success, or
     detailing any errors that have occurred.

   Each entry returned will contain all attributes, complete with
   associated values if necessary, as specified in the 'attributes'
   field of the Search Request.

   Note that an X.500 "list" operation can be emulated by a one-level
   LDAP search operation with a filter checking for the existence of the
   objectClass attribute, and that an X.500 "read" operation can be
   emulated by a base object LDAP search operation with the same filter.

4.4.  Modify Operation

   The Modify Operation allows a client to request that a modification
   of the DIB be performed on its behalf by a server.  The Modify
   Request is defined as follows:






Yeong, Howes & Kille                                           [Page 10]

RFC 1487                       X.500 LDAP                      July 1993


 ModifyRequest ::=
     [APPLICATION 6] SEQUENCE {
          object         LDAPDN,
          modification   SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
                              operation      ENUMERATED {
                                                  add       (0),
                                                  delete    (1),
                                                  replace   (2)
                                             },
                              modification   SEQUENCE {
                                                type    AttributeType,
                                                values  SET OF
                                                          AttributeValue
                                             }
                         }
     }

   Parameters of the Modify Request are:

   - object: The object to be modified. The value of this field should
     name the object to be modified after all aliases have been
     dereferenced. The server will not perform any alias dereferencing in
     determining the object to be modified.

   - A list of modifications to be performed on the entry to be modified.
     The entire list of entry modifications should be performed
     in the order they are listed, as a single atomic operation.  While
     individual modifications may violate the Directory schema, the
     resulting entry after the entire list of modifications is performed
     must conform to the requirements of the Directory schema. The
     values that may be taken on by the 'operation' field in each
     modification construct have the following semantics respectively:

             add: add values listed to the given attribute, creating
             the attribute if necessary;

             delete: delete values listed from the given attribute,
             removing the entire attribute if no values are listed, or
             if all current values of the attribute are listed for
             deletion;

             replace: replace existing values of the given attribute
             with the new values listed, creating the attribute if
             necessary.

   The result of the modify attempted by the server upon receipt of a
   Modify Request is returned in a Modify Response, defined as follows:




Yeong, Howes & Kille                                           [Page 11]

RFC 1487                       X.500 LDAP                      July 1993


     ModifyResponse ::= [APPLICATION 7] LDAPResult

   Upon receipt of a Modify Request, a server will perform the necessary
   modifications to the DIB.

   The server will return to the client a single Modify Response
   indicating either the successful completion of the DIB modification,
   or the reason that the modification failed. Note that due to the
   requirement for atomicity in applying the list of modifications in
   the Modify Request, the client may expect that no modifications of
   the DIB have been performed if the Modify Response received indicates
   any sort of error, and that all requested modifications have been
   performed if the Modify Response indicates successful completion of
   the Modify Operation.

4.5.  Add Operation

   The Add Operation allows a client to request the addition of an entry
   into the Directory. The Add Request is defined as follows:

     AddRequest ::=
         [APPLICATION 8] SEQUENCE {
              entry          LDAPDN,
              attrs          SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {
                                  type          AttributeType,
                                  values        SET OF AttributeValue
                             }
         }

   Parameters of the Add Request are:

   - entry: the Distinguished Name of the entry to be added. Note that
     all components of the name except for the last RDN component must
     exist for the add to succeed.

   - attrs: the list of attributes that make up the content of the entry
     being added.

   The result of the add attempted by the server upon receipt of a Add
   Request is returned in the Add Response, defined as follows:

     AddResponse ::= [APPLICATION 9] LDAPResult

   Upon receipt of an Add Request, a server will attempt to perform the
   add requested. The result of the add attempt will be returned to the
   client in the Add Response.

4.6.  Delete Operation

   The Delete Operation allows a client to request the removal of an
   entry from the Directory. The Delete Request is defined as follows:

     DelRequest ::= [APPLICATION 10] LDAPDN

   The Delete Request consists only of the Distinguished Name of the
   entry to be deleted.  The result of the delete attempted by the
   server upon receipt of a Delete Request is returned in the Delete
   Response, defined as follows:

     DelResponse ::= [APPLICATION 11] LDAPResult

   Upon receipt of a Delete Request, a server will attempt to perform
   the entry removal requested. The result of the delete attempt will be
   returned to the client in the Delete Response. Note that only leaf
   objects may be deleted with this operation.

4.7.  Modify RDN Operation

   The Modify RDN Operation allows a client to change the last component
   of the name of an entry in the Directory. The Modify RDN Request is
   defined as follows:

     ModifyRDNRequest ::=
         [APPLICATION 12] SEQUENCE {
              entry          LDAPDN,
              newrdn         RelativeLDAPDN
         }

   Parameters of the Modify RDN Request are:

   - entry: the name of the entry to be changed.

   - newrdn: the RDN that will form the last component of the new name.

   The result of the name change attempted by the server upon receipt of
   a Modify RDN Request is returned in the Modify RDN Response, defined
   as follows:

     ModifyRDNResponse ::= [APPLICATION 13] LDAPResult

   Upon receipt of a Modify RDN Request, a server will attempt to
   perform the name change. The result of the name change attempt will
   be returned to the client in the Modify RDN Response. The attributes
   that make up the old RDN are deleted from the entry.

RFC 1487                       X.500 LDAP                      July 1993


4.8.  Compare Operation

   The Compare Operation allows a client to compare an assertion
   provided with an entry in the Directory. The Compare Request is
   defined as follows:

     CompareRequest ::=
         [APPLICATION 14] SEQUENCE {
              entry          LDAPDN,
              ava            AttributeValueAssertion
         }

   Parameters of the Compare Request are:

   - entry: the name of the entry to be compared with.

   - ava: the assertion with which the entry is to be compared.

   The result of the compare attempted by the server upon receipt of a
   Compare Request is returned in the Compare Response, defined as
   follows:

     CompareResponse ::= [APPLICATION 15] LDAPResult

   Upon receipt of a Compare Request, a server will attempt to perform
   the requested comparison. The result of the comparison will be
   returned to the client in the Compare Response. Note that errors and
   the result of comparison are all returned in the same construct.

4.9.  Abandon Operation

   The function of the Abandon Operation is to allow a client to request
   that the server abandon an outstanding operation.  The Abandon
   Request is defined as follows:

     AbandonRequest ::= [APPLICATION 16] MessageID

   There is no response defined in the Abandon Operation. Upon
   transmission of an Abandon Operation, a client may expect that the
   operation identified by the Message ID in the Abandon Request has
   been abandoned. In the event that a server receives an Abandon
   Request on a Search Operation in the midst of transmitting responses
   to that search, that server should cease transmitting responses to
   the abandoned search immediately.

5.  Protocol Element Encodings

   The protocol elements of LDAP are encoded for exchange using the
   Basic Encoding Rules (BER) [11] of ASN.1 [10]. However, due to the
   high overhead involved in using certain elements of the BER, the
   following additional restrictions are placed on BER-encodings of LDAP
   protocol elements:

   (1)  Only the definite form of length encoding will be used.

   (2)  Bitstrings and octet strings will be encoded in the primitive form
        only.

6.  Security Considerations

   This version of the protocol provides facilities only for simple
   authentication using a cleartext password, and for kerberos version 4
   authentication.  Future versions of LDAP will likely include support
   for other authentication methods.
