RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


1.  Introduction

   There are many entities, such as registrars, resellers, DNS service
   operators, and privacy proxies, involved in the domain registration
   business.  These kinds of entities have not been formally defined as
   having an object in Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP).  This
   document provides a way to specify them as "organization" entities.

   This document describes an organization object mapping for version
   1.0 of the EPP [RFC5730].  This mapping is specified using XML 1.0 as
   described in [W3C.REC-xml-20081126] and XML Schema notation as
   described in [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028] and
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client, and
   "S:" represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a required feature of this specification.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented.

   The XML namespace prefix "org" is used for the namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0", but implementations MUST NOT
   depend on it; instead, they should employ a proper namespace-aware
   XML parser and serializer to interpret and output the XML documents.

3.  Object Attributes

   An EPP organization object has attributes and associated values that
   can be viewed and modified by the sponsoring client or the server.
   This section describes each attribute type in detail.  The formal
   syntax for the attribute values described here can be found in the
   "Formal Syntax" section of this document and in the appropriate
   normative references.

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


3.1.  Organization Identifier

   All EPP organizations are identified by a server-unique identifier.
   Organization identifiers are character strings with a specified
   minimum length, a specified maximum length, and a specified format.
   Organization identifiers use the "clIDType" client identifier syntax
   described in [RFC5730].  The corresponding element is <org:id>.

3.2.  Organization Roles

   The organization roles are used to represent the relationship an
   organization could have.  The corresponding element is <org:role>.
   An organization object MUST always have at least one associated role.
   Roles can be set only by the client that sponsors an organization
   object.  A client can change the role of an organization object using
   the EPP <update> command (see Section 4.2.5).

3.2.1.  Role Type

   An organization role MUST have a type field, which may have any of
   the values listed in Section 7.3.  The corresponding element is
   <org:type>.  An organization could have multiple roles with different
   role types.

3.2.2.  Role Status

   A role of an organization object MAY have its own statuses.  The
   corresponding element is <org:status>.  The possible values for the
   role status are defined in Section 3.5.

3.2.3.  Role Identifier

   A role MAY have a third-party-assigned identifier such as the IANA ID
   for registrars.  The corresponding element is <org:roleID>.

   Example of organization role identifier:

   <org:role>
     <org:type>registrar</org:type>
     <org:status>ok</org:status>
     <org:status>linked</org:status>
     <org:roleID>1362</org:roleID>
   </org:role>

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


3.3.  Contact and Client Identifiers

   All EPP contacts are identified by server-unique identifiers.
   Contact identifiers are character strings with a specified minimum
   length, a specified maximum length, and a specified format.  Contact
   identifiers use the "clIDType" client identifier syntax described in
   [RFC5730].

3.4.  Organization Status Values

   An organization object MUST always have at least one associated
   status value.  Status values can be set only by the client that
   sponsors an organization object and by the server on which the object
   resides.  A client can change the status of an organization object
   using the EPP <update> command.  Each status value MAY be accompanied
   by a string of human-readable text that describes the rationale for
   the status applied to the object.

   A client MUST NOT alter server status values set by the server.  A
   server MAY alter or override status values set by a client, subject
   to local server policies.  The status of an object MAY change as a
   result of either a client-initiated transform command or an action
   performed by a server operator.

   Status values that can be added or removed by a client are prefixed
   with "client".  Corresponding server status values that can be added
   or removed by a server are prefixed with "server".  The "hold" and
   "terminated" status values are server managed when the organization
   has no parent identifier (Section 3.6) and otherwise MAY be client
   managed based on server policy.  Other status values that do not
   begin with either "client" or "server" are server managed.

   Status Value Descriptions:

   o  ok: This is the normal status value for an object that has no
      operations pending or active prohibitions.  This value is set and
      removed by the server as other status values are added or removed.

   o  hold: Organization transform commands and new links MUST be
      rejected.

   o  terminated: The organization that has been terminated MUST NOT be
      linked.  Organization transform commands and new links MUST be
      rejected.







Zhou, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


   o  linked: The organization object has at least one active
      association with another object.  The "linked" status is not
      explicitly set by the client.  Servers should provide services to
      determine existing object associations.

   o  clientLinkProhibited, serverLinkProhibited: Requests to add new
      links to the organization MUST be rejected.

   o  clientUpdateProhibited, serverUpdateProhibited: Requests to update
      the object (other than to remove this status) MUST be rejected.

   o  clientDeleteProhibited, serverDeleteProhibited: Requests to delete
      the object MUST be rejected.

   o  pendingCreate, pendingUpdate, pendingDelete: A transform command
      has been processed for the object, but the action has not been
      completed by the server.  Server operators can delay action
      completion for a variety of reasons, such as to allow for human
      review or third-party action.  A transform command that is
      processed, but whose requested action is pending, is noted with
      response code 1001.

   "pendingCreate", "ok", "hold", and "terminated" are mutually
   exclusive statuses.  An organization MUST have exactly one of these
   statuses set.

   "ok" status MAY only be combined with "linked" status.

   A client or server MAY combine "linked" with either
   "clientLinkProhibited" or "serverLinkProhibited" if new links must be
   prohibited.

   "pendingDelete" status MUST NOT be combined with either
   "clientDeleteProhibited" or "serverDeleteProhibited" status.

   The "pendingCreate", "pendingDelete", and "pendingUpdate" status
   values MUST NOT be combined with each other.

   If "clientUpdateProhibited" or "serverUpdateProhibited" is set, the
   client will not be able to update the object.  For
   "clientUpdateProhibited", the client will first need to remove
   "clientUpdateProhibited" prior to attempting to update the object.
   The server can modify the object at any time.

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


3.5.  Role Status Values

   A role SHOULD have at least one associated status value.  Valid
   values include "ok", "linked", "clientLinkProhibited", and
   "serverLinkProhibited".

   Status Value Descriptions:

   o  ok: This is the normal status value for a role that has no
      operations pending or active prohibitions.  This value is set and
      removed by the server as other status values are added or removed.

   o  linked: The role of an organization object has at least one active
      association with another object.  The "linked" status is not
      explicitly set by the client.  Servers SHOULD provide services to
      determine existing object associations.

   o  clientLinkProhibited, serverLinkProhibited: Requests to add new
      links to the role MUST be rejected.

3.6.  Parent Identifier

   Organizations can have more than one layer.  The parent identifier,
   as defined with the <org:parentId> element, represents the parent
   organization identifier in a child organization.

   The case of reseller organizations provides an example.  The parent
   identifier is not defined for the top-level reseller, namely the
   registrar of the registry.  An N-tier reseller has a parent reseller
   and at least one child reseller.  A reseller customer has a parent
   reseller and no child resellers.

   Loops MUST be prohibited.  For example: if organization A has
   organization B as its parent identifier, organization B cannot have
   organization A as its parent identifier.  The same is true for larger
   loops involving three or more organizations.

3.7.  URL

   The URL represents the organization web home page, as defined with
   the <org:url> element.

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


3.8.  Dates and Times

   Date and time attribute values MUST be represented in Coordinated
   Universal Time (UTC) using the Gregorian calendar.  The extended
   date-time form using uppercase "T" and "Z" characters defined in
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028] MUST be used to represent date-time
   values, as XML Schema does not support truncated date-time forms or
   lowercase "T" and "Z" characters.

4.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing organization information via EPP.

4.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides two commands to retrieve organization information:
   <check> to determine if an organization object can be provisioned
   within a repository and <info> to retrieve detailed information
   associated with an organization object.  This document does not
   define a mapping for the EPP <transfer> command to retrieve
   organization-object transfer status information.

4.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   The EPP <check> command is used to determine if an object can be
   provisioned within a repository.  It provides a hint that allows a
   client to anticipate the success or failure of provisioning an object
   using the <create> command, as object-provisioning requirements are
   ultimately a matter of server policy.

   In addition to the standard EPP command elements, the <check> command
   MUST contain an <org:check> element.  This element or its ancestor
   element MUST identify the organization namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0".  The <org:check> element
   contains the following child elements:

   o  One or more <org:id> elements that contain the server-unique
      identifier of the organization objects to be queried.










Zhou, et al.                 Standards Track                    [Page 8]

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


   Example <check> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <check>
   C:      <org:check
   C:        xmlns:org="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0">
   C:        <org:id>res1523</org:id>
   C:        <org:id>re1523</org:id>
   C:        <org:id>1523res</org:id>
   C:      </org:check>
   C:    </check>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>

   When a <check> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child <org:chkData> element.  This
   element or its ancestor element MUST identify the organization
   namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0".  The <org:chkData>
   element contains one or more <org:cd> elements that contain the
   following child elements:

   o  An <org:id> element that identifies the queried object.  This
      element MUST contain an "avail" attribute whose value indicates
      object availability (can it be provisioned or not) at the moment
      the <check> command was completed.  A value of "1" or "true" means
      that the object can be provisioned.  A value of "0" or "false"
      means that the object cannot be provisioned.

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:reason> element that may be provided when an
      object cannot be provisioned.  If present, this element contains
      server-specific text to help explain why the object cannot be
      provisioned.  This text MUST be represented in the response
      language previously negotiated with the client; an OPTIONAL "lang"
      attribute as defined in [RFC5646] may be present to identify the
      language if the negotiated value is something other than the
      default value of "en"(English).

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


   Example <check> response:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1000">
   S:      <msg lang="en">Command completed successfully</msg>
   S:    </result>
   S:    <resData>
   S:      <org:chkData
   S:        xmlns:org="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0">
   S:        <org:cd>
   S:          <org:id avail="1">res1523</org:id>
   S:        </org:cd>
   S:        <org:cd>
   S:          <org:id avail="0">re1523</org:id>
   S:          <org:reason lang="en">In use</org:reason>
   S:        </org:cd>
   S:        <org:cd>
   S:          <org:id avail="1">1523res</org:id>
   S:        </org:cd>
   S:      </org:chkData>
   S:    </resData>
   S:    <trID>
   S:      <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   S:      <svTRID>54322-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:    </trID>
   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if a <check> command cannot be
   processed for any reason.

4.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   The EPP <info> command is used to retrieve information associated
   with an organization object.  In addition to the standard EPP command
   elements, the <info> command MUST contain an <org:info> element.
   This element or its ancestor element MUST identify the organization
   namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0".  The <org:info>
   element contains the following child element:

   o  An <org:id> element that contains the server-unique identifier of

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain a child <org:infData> element.  This
   element or its ancestor element MUST identify the organization
   namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0".  The <org:infData>
   element contains the following child elements:

   o  An <org:id> element that contains the server-unique identifier of
      the organization object, as defined in Section 3.1.

   o  An <org:roid> element that contains the Repository Object
      Identifier assigned to the organization object when the object was
      created.

   o  Zero to two <org:postalInfo> elements that contain postal-address
      information.  Two elements are provided so that address
      information can be provided in both internationalized and
      localized forms; a "type" attribute is used to identify the two
      forms.  If an internationalized form (type="int") is provided,
      element content MUST be represented in a subset of Unicode
      [UNICODE] in the range U+0020 - U+007E.  If a localized form

4.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Query Command

   The transfer semantics do not apply to organization objects.  No EPP
   <transfer> query command is defined in this document.

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


4.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   This document provides three commands to transform organization
   object information: <create> to create an instance of an organization
   object, <delete> to delete an instance of an organization object, and
   <update> to change information associated with an organization
   object.  This document does not define a mapping for the EPP
   <transfer> and <renew> command.

   Transform commands are typically processed and completed in real
   time.  Server operators MAY receive and process transform commands
   but defer completing the requested action if human or third-party
   review is required before the requested action can be completed.  In
   such situations, the server MUST return a 1001 response code to the
   client to note that the command has been received and processed but
   that the requested action is pending.  The server MUST also manage
   the status of the object that is the subject of the command to
   reflect the initiation and completion of the requested action.  Once
   the action has been completed, the client MUST be notified using a
   service message that the action has been completed and the status of
   the object has changed.  Other notification methods MAY be used in
   addition to the required service message.

4.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   The EPP <create> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to create an organization object.  In addition to the standard
   EPP command elements, the <create> command MUST contain an
   <org:create> element.  This element or its ancestor element MUST
   identify the organization namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-
   1.0".  The <org:create> element contains the following child
   elements:

   o  An <org:id> element that contains the desired server-unique
      identifier for the organization to be created, as defined in
      Section 3.1.

   o  One or more <org:role> elements that contain the role type, role
      statuses, and optional role ID of the organization.

      *  An <org:type> element that contains the type of the
         organization, as defined in Section 3.2.

      *  Zero or more <org:status> elements that contain the role
         statuses.  The possible values of the role statuses are defined
         in Section 3.5.

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


      *  An OPTIONAL <org:roleID> element that contains a third-party-
         assigned identifier, such as IANA ID for registrars, as defined
         in Section 3.2.3.

   o  Zero or more <org:status> elements that contain the operational
      status of the organization, as defined in Section 3.4.

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:parentId> element that contains the identifier of
      the parent object, as defined in Section 3.6.

   o  Zero to two <org:postalInfo> elements that contain postal-address
      information.  Two elements are provided so that address
      information can be provided in both internationalized and
      localized forms; a "type" attribute is used to identify the two
      forms.  If an internationalized form (type="int") is provided,
      element content MUST be represented in a subset of Unicode
      [UNICODE] in the range U+0020 - U+007E.  If a localized form
      (type="loc") is provided, element content MAY be represented in
      unrestricted UTF-8.  The <org:postalInfo> element contains the
      following child elements:

      *  An <org:name> element that contains the name of the
         organization.

      *  An OPTIONAL <org:addr> element that contains address
         information associated with the organization.  An <org:addr>
         element contains the following child elements:

         +  One, two, or three <org:street> elements that contain the
            organization's street address.

         +  An <org:city> element that contains the organization's city.

         +  An OPTIONAL <org:sp> element that contains the
            organization's state or province.

         +  An OPTIONAL <org:pc> element that contains the
            organization's postal code.

         +  An <org:cc> element that contains the alpha-2 organization's
            country code.  The detailed format of this element is
            described in Section 2.4.3 of [RFC5733].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:voice> element that contains the organization's
      voice telephone number.  The detailed format of this element is
      described in Section 2.5 of [RFC5733].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:fax> element that contains the organization's
      facsimile telephone number.  The detailed format of this element
      is described in Section 2.5 of [RFC5733].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:email> element that contains the organization's
      email address.  The detailed format of this element is described
      of [RFC5322].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:url> element that contains the URL to the website
      of the organization.  The detailed format of this element is
      described in [RFC3986].

   o  Zero or more <org:contact> elements that contain identifiers for
      the contact objects associated with the organization object.

4.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   The EPP <delete> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to delete an organization object.  In addition to the standard
   EPP command elements, the <delete> command MUST contain an
   <org:delete> element.  This element or its ancestor element MUST
   identify the organization namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-
   1.0".  The <org:delete> element MUST contain the following child
   element:

   o  An <org:id> element that contains the server-unique identifier of
      the organization object to be deleted, as defined in Section 3.1.

   An organization object MUST NOT be deleted if it is associated with
   other known objects.  An associated organization MUST NOT be deleted
   until associations with other known objects have been broken.  A
   server MUST notify clients that object relationships exist by sending
   a 2305 error response code when a <delete> command is attempted and
   fails due to existing object relationships.

   Example <delete> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <delete>
   C:      <org:delete
   C:       xmlns:org="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0">
   C:        <org:id>res1523</org:id>
   C:      </org:delete>
   C:    </delete>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C:</epp>

   When a <delete> command has been processed successfully, a server
   MUST respond with an EPP response with no <resData> element.

   Example <delete> response:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1000">

   S:      <svTRID>54321-XYZ</svTRID>
   S:    </trID>
   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if a <delete> command cannot
   be processed for any reason.

4.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   Renewal semantics do not apply to organization objects, so there is
   no mapping defined for the EPP <renew> command.

4.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   Transfer semantics do not apply to organization objects, so there is
   no mapping defined for the EPP <transfer> command.

4.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   The EPP <update> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to modify the attributes of an organization object.  In
   addition to the standard EPP command elements, the <update> command
   MUST contain an <org:update> element.  This element or its ancestor
   element MUST identify the organization namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0".  The <org:update> element
   contains the following child elements:

   o  An <org:id> element that contains the server-unique identifier of
      the organization object to be updated, as defined in Section 3.1.

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:add> element that contains attribute values to be
      added to the object.

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:rem> element that contains attribute values to be
      removed from the object.

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


   o  An OPTIONAL <org:chg> element that contains attribute values to be
      changed.

   At least one <org:add>, <org:rem>, or <org:chg> element MUST be
   provided if the command is not being extended.  All of these elements
   MAY be omitted if an <update> extension is present.  The OPTIONAL
   <org:add> and <org:rem> elements contain the following child
   elements:

   o  Zero or more <org:contact> elements that contain the identifiers
      for contact objects to be associated with or removed from the
      organization object.  Contact object identifiers MUST be known to
      the server before the contact object can be associated with the
      organization object.

   o  Zero or more <org:role> elements that contain the role type, role
      statuses, and optional role ID of the organization.

      *  An <org:type> element that contains the role type of the
         organization, as defined in Section 3.2.  The role type
         uniquely identifies the role to update.

      *  Zero or more <org:status> elements that contain the role
         statuses.  The values of the role status are defined in
         Section 3.5.

      *  An OPTIONAL <org:roleID> element that contains a third-party-
         assigned identifier, such as IANA ID for registrars, as defined
         in Section 3.2.3.

   o  Zero or more <org:status> elements that contain the operational
      status of the organization.

   An OPTIONAL <org:chg> element contains the following child elements,
   where at least one child element MUST be present:

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:parentId> element that contains the identifier of
      the parent object.

   o  Zero to two <org:postalInfo> elements that contain postal-address
      information.  Two elements are provided so that address
      information can be provided in both internationalized and
      localized forms; a "type" attribute is used to identify the two
      forms.  If an internationalized form (type="int") is provided,
      element content MUST be represented in a subset of Unicode
      [UNICODE] in the range U+0020 - U+007E.  If a localized form
      (type="loc") is provided, element content MAY be represented in
      unrestricted UTF-8.  The change of the postal info is defined as a

      replacement of that postal info element with the contents of the
      sub-elements included in the <update> command.  An empty
      <org:postalInfo> element is supported to allow a type of postal
      info to be removed.  The <org:postalInfo> element contains the
      following child elements:

      *  An <org:name> element that contains the name of the
         organization.

      *  An OPTIONAL <org:addr> element that contains address
         information associated with the organization.  An <org:addr>
         element contains the following child elements:

         +  One, two, or three <org:street> elements that contain the
            organization's street address.

         +  An <org:city> element that contains the organization's city.

         +  An OPTIONAL <org:sp> element that contains the
            organization's state or province.

         +  An OPTIONAL <org:pc> element that contains the
            organization's postal code.

         +  An <org:cc> element that contains the alpha-2 organization's
            country code.  The detailed format of this element is
            described in Section 2.4.3 of [RFC5733].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:voice> element that contains the organization's
      voice telephone number.  The detailed format of this element is
      described in Section 2.5 of [RFC5733].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:fax> element that contains the organization's
      facsimile telephone number.  The detailed format of this element
      is described in Section 2.5 of [RFC5733].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:email> element that contains the organization's
      email address.  The detailed format of this element is described
      in [RFC5322].

   o  An OPTIONAL <org:url> element that contains the URL to the website
      of the organization.  The detailed format of this element is
      described in [RFC3986].

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if an <update> command cannot
   be processed for any reason.

4.3.  Offline Review of Requested Actions

   Commands are processed by a server in the order they are received
   from a client.  Though an immediate response confirming receipt and
   processing of the command is produced by the server, a server
   operator MAY perform an offline review of requested transform
   commands before completing the requested action.  In such situations,
   the response from the server MUST clearly note that the transform
   command has been received and processed, but the requested action is
   pending.  The status in the response of the corresponding object MUST
   clearly reflect processing of the pending action.  The server MUST
   notify the client when offline processing of the action has been
   completed.

   Examples describing a <create> command that requires offline review
   are included here.  Note the result code and message returned in
   response to the <create> command.

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>
   S:    <result code="1001">

   S:    </trID>
   S:  </response>
   S:</epp>

   The status of the organization object after returning this response
   MUST include "pendingCreate".  The server operator reviews the
   request offline and informs the client of the outcome of the review
   by queuing a service message for retrieval via the <poll> command; it
   MAY additionally use an out-of-band mechanism to inform the client of
   the outcome.

   The service message MUST contain text that describes the notification
   in the child <msg> element of the response <msgQ> element.  In
   addition, the EPP <resData> element MUST contain a child
   <org:panData> element.  This element or its ancestor element MUST
   identify the organization namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-
   1.0".  The <org:panData> element contains the following child
   elements:

   o  An <org:id> element that contains the server-unique identifier of
      the organization object.  The <org:id> element contains a REQUIRED
      "paResult" attribute.  A positive boolean value indicates that the
      request has been approved and completed.  A negative boolean value
      indicates that the request has been denied and the requested
      action has not been taken.

   o  An <org:paTRID> element that contains the client transaction
      identifier and server transaction identifier returned with the
      original response to process the command.  The client transaction
      identifier is OPTIONAL and will only be returned if the client
      provided an identifier with the original <create> command.

   o  An <org:paDate> element that contains the date and time describing
      when review of the requested action was completed.

   Example "review completed" service message:

   S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   S:  <response>

5.  Formal Syntax

   An EPP object mapping is specified in XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation of
   the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

6.  Internationalization Considerations

   EPP is represented in XML, which provides native support for encoding
   information using the Unicode character set [UNICODE] and its more
   compact representations, including UTF-8.  Conformant XML processors
   recognize both UTF-8 [RFC3629] and UTF-16 [RFC2781].  Though XML
   includes provisions to identify and use other character encodings
   through use of an "encoding" attribute in an <?xml?> declaration, use
   of UTF-8 is RECOMMENDED.

   As an extension of the EPP organization object mapping, the elements
   and element content described in this document MUST inherit the
   internationalization conventions used to represent higher-layer
   domain and core protocol structures present in an XML instance that
   includes this extension.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  XML Namespace

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  IANA has
   assigned the following URI.

   The organization namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:org-1.0

      Registrant Contact: IESG

      XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   The organization XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:epp:org-1.0

      Registrant Contact: IESG

      XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of RFC 8543 (this document).

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


7.2.  EPP Extension Registry

   The EPP extension described in this document has been registered by
   IANA in the "Extensions for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
   (EPP)" registry described in [RFC7451].  The details of the
   registration are as follows:

      Name of Extension: Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
      Organization Mapping

      Document status: Standards Track

      Reference: RFC 8543

      Registrant Name and Email Address: IESG, iesg@ietf.org

      TLDs: Any

      IPR Disclosure: None

      Status: Active

      Notes: None

7.3.  Role Type Values Registry

   IANA has created a new category of protocol registry for values of
   the organization roles.  The name of this registry is "EPP
   Organization Role Values".  The registration policy for this registry
   is "Expert Review" [RFC8126].

7.3.1.  Registration Template

   Value: The string value being registered.

   Description: Brief description of the organization role values.

   Registrant Name: For RFC specifications, state "IESG".  For other
   specifications, give the name of the responsible party.

   Registrant Contact Information: An email address, postal address, or
   some other information to be used to contact the registrant.

RFC 8543                EPP Organization Mapping              March 2019


7.3.2.  Initial Registry Contents

   The following are the initial registry contents:

      Value: registrar

      Description: The entity object instance represents the authority
      responsible for the registration in the registry.

      Registrant: IESG, iesg@ietf.org

      Value: reseller

      Description: The entity object instance represents a third party
      through which the registration was conducted (i.e., not the
      registry or registrar).

      Registrant: IESG, iesg@ietf.org

      Value: privacyproxy

      Description: The entity object instance represents a third party
      who could help to register a domain without exposing the
      registrants' private information.

      Registrant: IESG, iesg@ietf.org

      Value: dns-operator

      Description: The entity object instance represents a third-party
      DNS operator that maintains the name servers and zone data on
      behalf of a registrant.

      Registrant: IESG, iesg@ietf.org

8.  Security Considerations

   The organization object may have personally identifiable information,
   such as <org:contact>.  This information is not a required element in
   this document that can be provided on a voluntary basis.  If it is
   provided, both client and server MUST ensure that authorization
   information is stored and exchanged with high-grade encryption
   mechanisms to provide privacy services, which are specified in
   [RFC5733].  The security considerations described in [RFC5730] or
   those caused by the protocol layers used by EPP will apply to this
   specification as well.
