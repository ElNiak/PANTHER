1.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16, RFC 1155 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used
      for describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.
      STD 16, RFC 1212 [7] defines a more concise description mechanism,
      which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17, RFC 1213 [4] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15, RFC 1157 [3] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

   Instances of the object types defined in this document represent
   attributes of an IEEE 802.3 MAU.  Several types of MAUs are defined
   in the IEEE 802.3/ISO 8802-3 CSMA/CD standard [9].

   These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3 repeaters or to 802.3
   (Ethernet-like) interfaces.  For convenience this document refers to
   these devices as "repeater MAUs" and "interface MAUs."

   The definitions presented here are based on Draft 5 of Section 20 of
   IEEE P802.3p, "Layer Management for 10 Mb/s Medium Attachment Units

RFC 1515                     802.3 MAU MIB                September 1993


   (MAUs), Section 20" [10] dated 11 July 1992.

3.1.  Terminology

   Refer to Section 3.1.2 of [13] for simple definitions of the terms
   "repeater," "port," and "MAU" as used in the context of this
   document.  For a more complete and precise definition of these terms,
   refer to Section 9 of [9].

3.2.  Structure of MIB

   Objects in this MIB are arranged into MIB groups.  Each MIB group is
   organized as a set of related objects.

3.2.1.  The Repeater MAU Basic Group Definitions

   This group contains all repeater MAU-related configuration, status,
   and control objects.  Implementation of the dot3RpMauBasicGroup is
   mandatory for MAUs attached to repeaters.

3.2.2.  The Interface MAU Basic Group Definitions

   This group contains all interface MAU-related configuration, status,
   and control objects.  Implementation of the dot3IfMauBasicGroup is
   mandatory for MAUs attached to interfaces.

3.2.3.  The Broadband MAU Basic Group Definitions

   This group contains all broadband-specific MAU-related configuration
   objects.  Implementation of the dot3BroadMauBasicGroup is mandatory
   for 10BROAD36 MAUs, and is not appropriate for other types of MAUs.

3.3.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   It is assumed that an agent implementing this MIB will also implement
   (at least) the 'system' group defined in MIB-II [4].  The following
   sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should implement.

3.3.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

   In MIB-II, the 'system' group is defined as being mandatory for all
   systems such that each managed entity contains one instance of each
   object in the 'system' group.  Thus, those objects apply to the
   entity even if the entity's sole functionality is management of a
   MAU.

RFC 1515                     802.3 MAU MIB                September 1993


3.3.2.  Relationship to the 'interfaces' group

   The sections of this document that define interface MAU-related
   objects specify an extension to the 'interfaces' group of MIB-II [4].
   An agent implementing these interface-MAU related objects must also
   implement the 'interfaces' group of MIB-II.  The value of the same as
   the value of 'ifIndex' used to instantiate the interface to which the
   given MAU is connected.

   It is expected that an agent implementing the interface-MAU related
   objects in this MIB will also implement the Ethernet-like Interfaces
   MIB [11].

   (Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the
   sense of MIB-II's 'interfaces' group.  See section 3.4.2 of the
   repeater MIB [12] for more details.)

3.3.3.  Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB

   The section of this document that defines repeater MAU-related
   objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in
   [13].  An agent implementing these repeater-MAU related objects must
   also implement the 802.3 Repeater MIB.

   The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to
   instantiate a repeater MAU variable shall be the same as the values
   of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the
   port to which the given MAU is connected.

3.4.  Management of Internal MAUs

   In some situations, a MAU can be "internal" -- i.e., its
   functionality is implemented entirely within a device.  For example,
   a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater- MAU and/or an
   internal interface-MAU through which management communications
   originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass in order to
   reach the management agent associated with the repeater.  Such
   internal MAUs may or may not be managed.  If they are managed,
   objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate
   MIB group -- dot3RpMauBasicGroup for internal repeater-MAUs and
   dot3IfMauBasicGroup for internal interface-MAUs.

                    true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                    being initialized.

                    A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                    functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                    attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to its
                    specification.

                    A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI and the
                    media transmitter to idle.  Standby(4) mode only
                    applies to link type MAUs.  The state of
                    rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                    A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                    condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter as
                    though it were powered down.  The MAU may return
                    other(1) value for the mauJabber and
                    rpMauMediaAvailable objects when it is in this
                    state.  For an AUI, this state will remove power
                    from the AUI.

                    Setting this variable to the value reset(6) resets
                    the MAU in the same manner as a power-off, power-
                    on cycle of at least one-half second would.  The
                    agent is not required to return the value reset
                    (6).

                    Setting this variable to the value operational(3),
                    standby(4), or shutdown(5) causes the MAU to

                    mixing-type MAU or an AUI to standby(4) will cause

                    link test fail state/low light function.  For an
                    AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU this
                    indicates whether or not loopback is detected on
                    the DI circuit.  The value of this attribute
                    persists between packets for MAU types AUI,

                    The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's

                    for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For these MAUs
                    loopback will be tested on each transmission
                    during which no collision is detected.  If DI is

                    A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully

                    attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to its
                    specification.

                    A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI and the

                    condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter as

                    ifMauMediaAvailable objects when it is in this

                    Setting this variable to the value reset(6) resets

                    Setting this variable to the value operational(3),

            STATUS    mandatory
            DESCRIPTION
                    "If the MAU is a link or fiber type (FOIRL,
                    10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to the
                    link test fail state/low light function.  For an
                    AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU this
                    indicates whether or not loopback is detected on
                    the DI circuit.  The value of this attribute
                    persists between packets for MAU types AUI,
                    10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                    The value other(1) is returned if the
                    mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 6.

                    The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                    true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                    being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                    reset, the value of this attribute will be unknown
                    for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For these MAUs
                    loopback will be tested on each transmission
                    during which no collision is detected.  If DI is
                    receiving input when DO returns to IDL after a
                    transmission and there has been no collision
                    during the transmission then loopback will be
                    detected.  The value of this attribute will only
                    change during non-collided transmissions for AUI,
                    coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.

                    The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                    light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                    notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light, or
                    no loopback.

                    The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                    has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                    The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                    invalid signal has been received from the other
                    end of the link.  Both remoteFault(5) and
                    invalidSignal(6) apply only to MAUs of type
                    10BASE-FB."
