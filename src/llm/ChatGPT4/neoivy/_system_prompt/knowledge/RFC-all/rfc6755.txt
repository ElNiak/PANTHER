1.  Introduction

   Various extensions and companion specifications to the OAuth 2.0
   Authorization Framework [OAUTH-V2] utilize URIs to identify the
   extension in use or other relevant context.  This document creates
   and registers an IETF URN Sub-namespace, as documented in RFC 3553
   [RFC3553], for use with such specifications.  The new 'oauth' Sub-
   namespace is urn:ietf:params:oauth, and OAuth relevant parameters
   will be established underneath it.

2.  Registration Template

   If a registrant wishes to have an OAuth URI registered, then a URN of
   the form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<value> will be requested where
   <value> is a suitable representation of the functionality or concept
   being registered.

   The registration procedure for new entries requires a request in the
   form of the following template and is "Specification Required" per
   RFC 5226 [RFC5226].

   URN:
      The URI that identifies the registered functionality.

   Common Name:
      The name by which the functionality being registered is generally
      known.

   Change Controller:  For Standards Track RFCs, state "IETF".  For
      others, give the name of the responsible party.  Other details
      (e.g., postal address, email address, and home page URI) may also
      be included.

RFC 6755           An IETF URN Sub-Namespace for OAuth      October 2012


   Specification Document(s):  Reference to the document that specifies
      the URI, preferably including a URI that can be used to retrieve a
      copy of the document.  An indication of the relevant sections may
      also be included but is not required.

   The registration request for the urn:ietf:params:oauth URN Sub-
   namespace is found in the IANA Considerations section of this
   document (Section 4).

2.1.  Example Registration Request

   The following is an example registration request for a URI underneath
   the urn:ietf:params:oauth Sub-namespace.  The requested URI
   represents a new OAuth 2.0 grant type.

   This is a request to IANA to please register the value
   "grant-type:example" in the registry urn:ietf:params:oauth
   established in an IETF URN Sub-namespace for OAuth.

   o  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:example

   o  Common Name: An Example Grant Type for OAuth 2.0

   o  Change controller: IETF

   o  Specification Document: [the document URI]

3.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations beyond those already
   inherent to using URNs.  Security considerations for URNs in general
   can be found in RFC 2141 [RFC2141].

   Any work that is related to OAuth would benefit from familiarity with
   the security considerations of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework
   [OAUTH-V2].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the following:

   o  The registration of a new IANA URN Sub-namespace,
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:, per RFC 3553 [RFC3553].  The registration
      request can be found in Section 4.1 below.

   o  A new registry called the "OAuth URI" registry for URNs
      subordinate to urn:ietf:params:oauth.  The registry "OAuth URI"
      has been added to a new top-level registry called "OAuth

      Parameters" as defined by [OAUTH-V2].  Instructions for a
      registrant to request the registration of such a URN are in
      Section 2.

4.1.  IETF URN Sub-Namespace Registration urn:ietf:params:oauth

   Per RFC 3553 [RFC3553], IANA has registered a new URN Sub-namespace,
   urn:ietf:params:oauth.

   o  Registry name: oauth

   o  Specification: [this document]

   o  Repository: [The registry created in Section 2.]

   o  Index value: values subordinate to urn:ietf:params:oauth are of
      the form urn:ietf:params:oauth:<value> with <value> as the index
      value.  It is suggested that <value> include both a "class" and an
      "identifier-within-class" component, with the two components being
      separated by a colon (":"); other compositions of the <value> may
      also be used.
