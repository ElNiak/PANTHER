         IANA Registry for P-Multicast Service Interface (PMSI)
                        Tunnel Type Code Points

Abstract

   RFC 6514 created a space of Tunnel Type code points for a new BGP
   attribute called the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI
   Tunnel) attribute".  However, the RFC did not create a corresponding
   IANA registry.

   There now is need to make further code point allocations from this
   name space.  This document serves to update RFC 6514 in that it
   creates an IANA registry for that purpose.

1.  Introduction

   In 'BGP Encodings and Procedures for Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs'
   [RFC6514], an optional transitive BGP attribute called the
   "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute" is
   specified.  This BGP attribute uses an octet field to specify the
   PMSI tunnel type.  RFC 6514 allocates the values 0-7.

   There is now a need to make further code point allocations from this
   name space.  In particular, "Inter-Area P2MP Segmented LSPs"
   [SEAMLESS-MCAST] needs to make such an allocation.  However, the RFC
   did not create an IANA registry for these code points.

   This document creates a new IANA registry called "P-Multicast Service
   Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel Types" for these code points.
   The registry is created in the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" registry.

   Creating this registry is an update of RFC 6514 [RFC6514].

2.  Security Considerations

   This document simply creates an IANA registry from a table in RFC
   6514.  Thus, there are no security concerns.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created a new registry called "P-Multicast Service Interface
   Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) Tunnel Types" in the "Border Gateway Protocol
   (BGP) Parameters" registry.

   The allocation policy for values 0x00 to 0xFA is IETF Review
   [RFC5226].  Values 0xFB to 0xFE are experimental and are not to be
   assigned. 0xFF is reserved, the status of 0xFF may only be changed
   through Standards Action [RFC5226].

   The initial registry should appear as:

      Value        Meaning                        Reference

      0x00         no tunnel information present  [RFC6514]
      0x01         RSVP-TE P2MP LSP               [RFC6514]
      0x02         mLDP P2MP LSP                  [RFC6514]
      0x03         PIM-SSM Tree                   [RFC6514]
      0x04         PIM-SM Tree                    [RFC6514]
      0x05         BIDIR-PIM Tree                 [RFC6514]
      0x06         Ingress Replication            [RFC6514]
      0x07         mLDP MP2MP LSP                 [RFC6514]
      0x08 - 0xFA  Unassigned
      0xFB - 0xFE  Experimental                   [RFC7385]
      0xFF         Reserved                       [RFC7385]
