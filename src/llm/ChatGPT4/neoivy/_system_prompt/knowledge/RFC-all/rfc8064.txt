          Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers

Abstract

   This document changes the recommended default Interface Identifier
   (IID) generation scheme for cases where Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is used to generate a stable IPv6 address.
   It recommends using the mechanism specified in RFC 7217 in such
   cases, and recommends against embedding stable link-layer addresses
   in IPv6 IIDs.  It formally updates RFC 2464, RFC 2467, RFC 2470, RFC
   2491, RFC 2492, RFC 2497, RFC 2590, RFC 3146, RFC 3572, RFC 4291, RFC
   4338, RFC 4391, RFC 5072, and RFC 5121.  This document does not
   change any existing recommendations concerning the use of temporary
   addresses as specified in RFC 4941.

RFC 8064              Default Interface Identifiers        February 2017


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring one or
   more "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a
   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that
   typically embeds a stable link-layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC
   address).

   In some network technologies and adaptation layers, the use of an IID
   based on a link-layer address may offer some advantages.  For
   example, [RFC6282] allows for the compression of IPv6 datagrams over
   IEEE 802.15.4-based networks [RFC4944] when the IID is based on the
   underlying link-layer address.

   The security and privacy implications of embedding a stable link-
   layer address in an IPv6 IID have been known for some time now and
   are discussed in great detail in [RFC7721].  They include:

   o  Network-activity correlation

   o  Location tracking

   o  Address scanning

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation

   More generally, the reuse of identifiers that have their own
   semantics or properties across different contexts or scopes can be
   detrimental for security and privacy [NUM-IDS].  In the case of
   traditional stable IPv6 IIDs, some of the security and privacy
   implications are dependent on the properties of the underlying link-
   layer addresses (e.g., whether the link-layer address is ephemeral or
   randomly generated), while other implications (e.g., reduction of the
   entropy of the IID) depend on the algorithm for generating the IID
   itself.  In standardized recommendations for stable IPv6 IID
   generation meant to achieve particular security and privacy
   properties, it is necessary to recommend against embedding stable
   link-layer addresses in IPv6 IIDs.

   Furthermore, some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated
   from the traditional stable IID generation scheme to mitigate the
   aforementioned security and privacy implications [Microsoft].

   As a result of the aforementioned issues, this document changes the
   recommended default IID generation scheme for generating stable IPv6
   addresses with SLAAC to that specified in [RFC7217] and recommends
   against embedding stable link-layer addresses in IPv6 Interface

RFC 8064              Default Interface Identifiers        February 2017


   Identifiers, such that the aforementioned issues are mitigated.  That
   is, this document simply replaces the default algorithm that is
   recommended to be employed when generating stable IPv6 IIDs.

   NOTE:
      [RFC4291] defines the "Modified EUI-64 format" for IIDs.
      Appendix A of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform an IEEE
      EUI-64 identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from which an
      EUI-64 identifier is derived, into an IID in the Modified EUI-64
      format.

   In a variety of scenarios, addresses that remain stable for the
   lifetime of a host's connection to a single subnet are viewed as
   desirable.  For example, stable addresses may be viewed as beneficial
   for network management, event logging, enforcement of access control,
   provision of quality of service, or for server or router interfaces.
   Similarly, stable addresses (as opposed to temporary addresses
   [RFC4941]) allow for long-lived TCP connections and are also usually
   desirable when performing server-like functions (i.e., receiving
   incoming connections).

   The recommendations in this document apply only in cases where
   implementations otherwise would have configured a stable IPv6 IID
   containing a link-layer address.  For example, this document does not
   change any existing recommendations concerning the use of temporary
   addresses as specified in [RFC4941] and the recommendations do not
   apply to cases where SLAAC is employed to generate non-stable IPv6
   addresses (e.g., by embedding a link-layer address that is
   periodically randomized); in addition, this document does not
   introduce any new requirements regarding when stable addresses are to
   be configured.  Thus, the recommendations in this document simply
   improve the security and privacy properties of stable addresses.

2.  Terminology

   Stable address:
      An address that does not vary over time within the same network
      (as defined in [RFC7721]).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers with SLAAC

   Nodes SHOULD implement and employ [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.  A link layer MAY also
   define a mechanism for stable IPv6 address generation that is more
   efficient and does not address the security and privacy
   considerations discussed in Section 1.  The choice of whether or not
   to enable the security- and privacy-preserving mechanism SHOULD be
   configurable in such a case.

   By default, nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes
   that embed a stable link-layer address in the IID.  In particular,
   this document RECOMMENDS that nodes do not generate stable IIDs with
   the schemes specified in [RFC2464], [RFC2467], [RFC2470], [RFC2491],
   [RFC2492], [RFC2497], [RFC2590], [RFC3146], [RFC3572], [RFC4338],
   [RFC4391], [RFC5072], and [RFC5121].

4.  Future Work

   At the time of this writing, the mechanisms specified in the
   following documents might require updates to be fully compatible with
   the recommendations in this document:

   o  "Compression Format for IPv6 Datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4-Based
      Networks" [RFC6282]

   o  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over IEEE 802.15.4 Networks"
      [RFC4944]

   o  "Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless
      Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs)" [RFC6775]

   o  "Transmission of IPv6 Packets over ITU-T G.9959 Networks"
      [RFC7428]

   Future revisions or updates of these documents should consider the
   issues of privacy and security mentioned in Section 1 and explain any
   design and engineering considerations that lead to the use of stable
   IIDs based on a node's link-layer address.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends against the (default) use of predictable
   Interface Identifiers in IPv6 addresses.  It recommends [RFC7217] as
   the default scheme for generating IPv6 stable addresses with SLAAC,
   such that the security and privacy issues of IIDs that embed stable
   link-layer addresses are mitigated.
