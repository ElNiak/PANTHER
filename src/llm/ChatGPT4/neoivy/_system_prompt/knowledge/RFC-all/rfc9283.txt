1.  Introduction

   In version 3 of the RFC Editor Model defined by [RFC9280], the RFC
   Series is governed by its own mechanisms.  This requires a
   modification to the Internet Architecture Board Charter [RFC2850].

   Also, RFC 2850 states that the RFC Editor appoints a liaison member
   to the IAB.  This is no longer necessary.

2.  Changed Text

   In Section 1.2 ("Ex-Officio and Liaison members") of [RFC2850], the
   phrase "the RFC Editor," is deleted.

   In Section 2 ("The Role of the IAB") of [RFC2850], under the heading
   "(d) RFC Series and IANA", the following sentence:

   |  The IAB must approve the appointment of an organization to act as
   |  RFC Editor and the general policy followed by the RFC Editor.

   is replaced by:

   |  The RFC Editor function is defined under the authority of the IAB
   |  by [RFC9280].

3.  Approval

   This document is published as an IETF Best Current Practice.  It has
   also been approved by the IAB and acknowledged by the Board of
   Trustees of the Internet Society.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document should not affect the security of the Internet.
