              Subcodes for BGP Finite State Machine Error

Abstract

   This document defines several subcodes for the BGP Finite State
   Machine (FSM) Error that could provide more information to help
   network operators in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating
   network events.  This document updates RFC 4271.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines several subcodes for the BGP [RFC4271] Finite
   State Machine (FSM) Error that could provide more information to help
   network operators in diagnosing BGP FSM issues and correlating
   network events.  This information is also helpful to developers in
   lab situations.  This document updates [RFC4271] by requiring that
   BGP implementations insert appropriate FSM Error subcodes in
   NOTIFICATION messages for BGP FSM errors.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Definition of Finite State Machine Error Subcodes

   This document defines the following subcodes for the BGP Finite State
   Machine Error:

   0 - Unspecified Error

   1 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State

   2 - Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State

   3 - Receive Unexpected Message in Established State

4.  Usage of FSM Error Subcodes

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g., KEEPALIVE/
   UPDATE/ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenSent state, it MUST
   send to the neighbor a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code

RFC 6608                  BGP FSM Error Subcode                 May 2012


   Finite State Machine Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected
   Message in OpenSent State".  The Data field is a 1-octet, unsigned
   integer that indicates the type of the unexpected message.

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g., OPEN/UPDATE/
   ROUTE-REFRESH message) on a session in OpenConfirm state, it MUST
   send a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Finite State Machine
   Error and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in
   OpenConfirm State" to the neighbor.  The Data field is a 1-octet,
   unsigned integer that indicates the type of the unexpected message.

   If a BGP speaker receives an unexpected message (e.g., OPEN message)
   on a session in Established State, it MUST send to the neighbor a
   NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code Finite State Machine Error
   and the Error Subcode "Receive Unexpected Message in Established
   State".  The Data field is a 1-octet, unsigned integer that indicates
   the type of the unexpected message.

5.  Security Considerations

   Specification, implementation, and deployment of the proposed BGP FSM
   Error subcodes could make BGP implementation fingerprinting easier
   and probably more accurate.  Operators using BGP need to consider
   this as an operational security consideration of their BGP deployment
   decisions.

   [BFMR2010] discusses a number of BGP security issues and potential
   solutions that might be relevant both to BGP implementers and BGP
   operators.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the registry "BGP Finite State Machine Error
   Subcodes", within the "BGP Error Subcodes" registry, with a
   Registration Procedure of "Standards Action" as defined in [RFC5226]
   (early allocation of such subcodes is allowed, in accordance with
   [RFC4020]).

   The registry has been populated with the following values:

   Value      Name
     0        Unspecified Error
     1        Receive Unexpected Message in OpenSent State
     2        Receive Unexpected Message in OpenConfirm State
     3        Receive Unexpected Message in Established State
