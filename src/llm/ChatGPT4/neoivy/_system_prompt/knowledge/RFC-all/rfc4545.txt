                 IP Storage User Identity Authorization

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing user identities and
   the names, addresses, and credentials required manage access control,
   for use with various protocols.  This document was motivated by the
   need for the configuration of authorized user identities for the
   iSCSI protocol, but has been extended to be useful for other
   protocols that have similar requirements.  It is important to note
   that this MIB module provides only the set of identities to be used
   within access lists; it is the responsibility of other MIB modules
   making use of this one to tie them to their own access lists or other
   authorization control methods.

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


1.  Introduction

   This MIB module will be used to configure and/or look at the
   configuration of user identities and their credential information.
   For the purposes of this MIB module, a "user" identity does not need
   to be an actual person; a user can also be a host, an application, a
   cluster of hosts, or any other identifiable entity that can be
   authorized to access a resource.

   Most objects in this MIB module have a MAX-ACCESS of read-create;
   this module is intended to allow configuration of user identities and
   their names, addresses, and credentials.  MIN-ACCESS for all objects
   is read-only for those implementations that configure through other
   means, but require the ability to monitor user identities.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The IPS-AUTH-MIB module does not directly address objects within
   other modules.  The identity address objects contain IPv4, IPv6, or
   other address types, and as such they may be indirectly related to
   objects within the IP [RFC4293] MIB module.

   This MIB module does not provide actual authorization or access
   control lists; it provides a means to identify entities that can be
   included in other authorization lists.  This should generally be done
   in MIB modules that reference identities in this one.  It also does
   not cover login or authentication failure statistics or



Bakke & Muchow              Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


   notifications, as these are all fairly application specific and are
   not generic enough to be included here.

   The user identity objects within this module are typically referenced
   from other modules by a RowPointer within that module.  A module
   containing resources for which it requires a list of authorized user
   identities may create such a list, with a single RowPointer within
   each list element pointing to a user identity within this module.
   This is neither required nor restricted by this MIB module.

5.  Relationship to the USM MIB Module

   The User-based Security Model (USM) [RFC3414] also defines the
   concept of a user, defining authentication and privacy protocols and
   their credentials.  The definition of USM includes the SNMP-USER-
   BASED-SM-MIB module allows configuration of SNMPv3 user credentials
   to protect SNMPv3 messages.  Although USM's users are not related to
   the user identities managed by the IPS-AUTH-MIB module defined in
   this document, USM will often be implemented on the same system as
   the IPS-AUTH-MIB module, with the SNMP-USER-BASED-SM-MIB module used
   to manage the security protecting SNMPv3 messages, including those
   that access the IPS-AUTH-MIB module.

   The term "user" in this document is distinct from an SNMPv3 user and
   is intended to include, but is not limited to, users of IP storage
   devices.  A "user" in this document is a collection of user names
   (unique identifiers), user addresses, and credentials that can be
   used together to determine whether an entity should be allowed access
   to a resource.  Each user can have multiple names, addresses, and
   credentials.  As a result, this MIB module is particularly suited to
   managing users of storage resources, which are typically given access
   control lists consisting of potentially multiple identifiers,
   addresses, and credentials.  This MIB module provides for
   authorization lists only and does not include setting of data privacy
   parameters.

   In contrast, an SNMPv3 user as defined in [RFC3414] has exactly one
   user-name, one authentication protocol, and one privacy protocol,
   along with their associated information and SNMP-specific
   information, such as an engine ID.  These objects are defined to
   support exactly the information needed for SNMPv3 security.

   For the remainder of this document, the term "user" means an IPS-
   AUTH-MIB user identity.

6.  Relationship to SNMP Contexts

   Each non-scalar object in the IPS-AUTH-MIB module is indexed first by
   an instance.  Each instance is a collection of identities that can be
   used to authorize access to a resource.  The use of an instance works
   well with partitionable or hierarchical devices and fits in logically
   with other management schemes.  Instances do not replace SNMP
   contexts; however, they do provide a very simple way to assign a
   collection of identities within a device to one or more SNMP
   contexts, without having to do so for each identity's row.

7.  Discussion

   This MIB module structure is intended to allow the configuration of a
   list of user identities, each with a list of names, addresses,
   credentials, and certificates that, when combined, will distinguish
   that identity.

   The IPS-AUTH-MIB module is structured around two primary "objects",
   the authorization instance and the identity, which serve as
   containers for the remainder of the objects.  This section contains a
   brief description of the "object" hierarchy and a description of each
   object, followed by a discussion of the actual SNMP table structure
   within the objects.

7.1.  Authorization MIB Object Model

   The top-level object in this structure is the authorization instance,
   which "contains" all of the other objects.  The indexing hierarchy of
   this module looks like:

   ipsAuthInstance
      -- A distinct authorization entity within the managed system.
      -- Most implementations will have just one of these.
      ipsAuthIdentity
         -- A user identity, consisting of a set of identity names,
         -- addresses, and credentials reflected in the following
         -- objects:
         ipsAuthIdentityName
            -- A name for a user identity.  A name should be globally
            -- unique, and unchanging over time.  Some protocols may
            -- not require this one.
         ipsAuthIdentityAddress
            -- An address range, typically but not necessarily an
            -- IPv4, IPv6, or Fibre Channel address range, at which
            -- the identity is allowed to reside.
         ipsAuthCredential
            -- A single credential, such as a CHAP username,

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


            -- which can be used to verify the identity.
            ipsAuthCredChap
               -- CHAP-specific attributes for an ipsAuthCredential
            ipsAuthCredSrp
               -- SRP-specific attributes
            ipsAuthCredKerberos
               -- Kerberos-specific attributes

   Each identity contains the information necessary to identify a
   particular end-point that wishes to access a service, such as iSCSI.

   An identity can contain multiple names, addresses, and credentials.
   Each of these names, addresses, and credentials exists in its own
   row.  If multiple rows of one of these three types are present, they
   are treated in an "OR" fashion; an entity to be authorized need only
   match one of the rows.  If rows of different types are present (e.g.,
   a name and an address), these are treated in an "AND" fashion; an
   entity to be authorized must match at least one row from each
   category.  If there are no rows present of a category, this category
   is ignored.

   For example, if an ipsAuthIdentity contains two rows of
   ipsAuthIdentityAddress, one row of ipsAuthCredential, and no rows of
   ipsAuthIdentityName, an entity must match the Credential row and at
   least one of the two Address rows to match the identity.

   Index values such as ipsAuthInstIndex and ipsAuthIdentIndex are
   referenced in multiple tables, and rows can be added and deleted.  An
   implementation should therefore attempt to keep all index values
   persistent across reboots; index values for rows that have been
   deleted must not be reused before a reboot.

7.2.  ipsAuthInstance

   The ipsAuthInstanceAttributesTable is the primary table of the IPS-
   AUTH-MIB module.  Every other table entry in this module includes the
   index of an ipsAuthInstanceAttributesEntry as its primary index.  An
   authorization instance is basically a managed set of identities.

   Many implementations will include just one authorization instance row
   in this table.  However, there will be cases where multiple rows in
   this table may be used:

      - A large system may be "partitioned" into multiple, distinct
        virtual systems, perhaps sharing the SNMP agent but not their
        lists of identities.  Each virtual system would have its own
        authorization instance.




Bakke & Muchow              Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


      - A set of stackable systems, each with its own set of identities,
        may be represented by a common SNMP agent.  Each individual
        system would have its own authorization instance.

      - Multiple protocols, each with its own set of identities, may
        exist within a single system and be represented by a single SNMP
        agent.  In this case, each protocol may have its own
        authorization instance.

   An entry in this table is often referenced by its name
   (ipsAuthInstDescr), which should be displayed to the user by the
   management station.  When an implementation supports only one entry
   in this table, the description may be returned as a zero-length
   string.

7.3.  ipsAuthIdentity

   The ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable contains one entry for each
   configured user identity.  The identity contains only a description
   of what the identity is used for; its attributes are all contained in
   other tables, since they can each have multiple values.

   Other MIB modules containing lists of users authorized to access a
   particular resource should generally contain a RowPointer to the
   ipsAuthIdentAttributesEntry that will, if authenticated, be allowed
   access to the resource.

   All other table entries make use of the indices to this table as
   their primary indices.

7.4.  ipsAuthIdentityName

   The ipsAuthIdentNameAttributesTable contains a list of UTF-8 names,
   each of which belongs to, and may be used to identify, a particular
   identity in the authIdentity table.

   Implementations making use of the IPS-AUTH-MIB module may identify
   their resources by names, addresses, or both.  A name is typically a
   unique (within the required scope), unchanging identifier for a
   resource.  It will normally meet some or all of the requirements for
   a Uniform Resource Name [RFC1737], although a name in the context of
   this MIB module does not need to be a URN.  Identifiers that
   typically change over time should generally be placed into the
   ipsAuthIdentityAddress table; names that have no uniqueness
   properties should usually be placed into the description attribute
   for the identity.





Bakke & Muchow              Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


   An example of an identity name is the iSCSI Name, defined in
   [RFC3720].  Any other MIB module defining names to be used as
   ipsAuthIdentityName objects should specify how its names are unique,
   and the domain within which they are unique.

   If this table contains no entries associated with a particular user
   identity, the implementation does not need to check any name
   parameters when verifying that identity.  If the table contains
   multiple entries associated with a particular user identity, the
   implementation should consider a match with any one of these entries
   to be valid.

7.5.  ipsAuthIdentityAddress

   The ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable contains a list of addresses at
   which the identity may reside.  For example, an identity may be
   allowed access to a resource only from a certain IP address, or only
   if its address is in a certain range or set of ranges.

   Each entry contains a starting and ending address.  If a single
   address is desired in the list, both starting and ending addresses
   must be identical.

   Each entry contains an AddrType attribute.  This attribute contains
   an enumeration registered as an IANA Address Family type [IANA-AF].
   Although many implementations will use IPv4 or IPv6 address types for
   these entries, any IANA-registered type may be used, as long as it
   makes sense to the application.

   Matching any address within any range within the list associated with
   a particular identity is considered a valid match.  If no entries are
   present in this list for a given identity, its address is
   automatically assumed to match the identity.

   Netmasks are not supported, since an address range can express the
   same thing with more flexibility.  An application specifying
   addresses using network masks may do so, and convert to and from
   address ranges when reading or writing this MIB module.

7.6.  ipsAuthCredential

   The ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable contains a list of credentials,
   each of which may be used to verify a particular identity.








Bakke & Muchow              Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


   Each credential contains an authentication method to be used, such as
   CHAP [RFC1994], SRP [RFC2945], or Kerberos [RFC4120].  This attribute
   contains an object identifier instead of an enumerated type, allowing
   other MIB modules to add their own authentication methods, without
   modifying this MIB module.

   For each entry in this table, there will exist an entry in another
   table containing its attributes.  The table in which to place the
   entry depends on the AuthMethod attribute:

   CHAP     If the AuthMethod is set to the CHAP OID, an entry using the
            same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredChap table, which contains the CHAP username.

   SRP      If the AuthMethod is set to the SRP OID, an entry using the
            same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredSrp table, which contains the SRP username.

   Kerberos If the AuthMethod is set to the Kerberos OID, an entry using
            the same indices as the ipsAuthCredential will exist in the
            ipsAuthCredKerberos table, which contains the Kerberos
            principal.

   Other    If the AuthMethod is set to any OID not defined in this
            module, an entry using the same indices as the
            ipsAuthCredential entry should be placed in the other module
            that define whatever attributes are needed for that type of
            credential.

   An additional credential type can be added to this MIB module by
   defining a new OID in the ipsAuthMethodTypes subtree, and defining a
   new table specific to that credential type.

7.7.  IP, Fibre Channel, and Other Addresses

   The IP addresses in this MIB module are represented by two
   attributes, one of type AddressFamilyNumbers, and the other of type
   AuthAddress.  Each address can take on any of the types within the
   list of address family numbers; the most likely being IPv4, IPv6, or
   one of the Fibre Channel address types.

   The type AuthAddress is an octet string.  If the address family is
   IPv4 or IPv6, the format is taken from the InetAddress specified in
   [RFC4001].  If the address family is one of the Fibre Channel types,
   the format is identical to the FcNameIdOrZero type defined in
   [RFC4044].

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


7.8.  Descriptors: Using OIDs in Place of Enumerated Types

   Some attributes, particularly the authentication method attribute,
   would normally require an enumerated type.  However, implementations
   will likely need to add new authentication method types of their own,
   without extending this MIB module.  To make this work, this module
   defines a set of object identities within ipsAuthDescriptors.  Each
   of these object identities is basically an enumerated type.

   Attributes that make use of these object identities have a value that
   is an OID instead of an enumerated type.  These OIDs can either
   indicate the object identities defined in this module, or object
   identities defined elsewhere, such as in an enterprise MIB module.
   Those implementations that add their own authentication methods
   should also define a corresponding object identity for each of these
   methods within their own enterprise MIB module, and return its OID
   whenever one of these attributes is using that method.

7.9.  Notifications

   Monitoring of authentication failures and other notification events
   are outside the scope of this MIB module, as they are generally
   application specific.  No notifications are provided or required.

       DESCRIPTION
           "IP Storage requires the use of address information
           that uses not only the InetAddress type defined in the
           INET-ADDRESS-MIB, but also Fibre Channel type defined
           in the Fibre Channel Management MIB.  Although these
           address types are recognized in the IANA Address Family
           Numbers MIB, the addressing mechanisms have not been
           merged into a well-known, common type.  This data type,
           the IpsAuthAddress, performs the merging for this MIB
           module.

           The formats of objects of this type are determined by
           a corresponding object with syntax AddressFamilyNumbers,
           and thus every object defined using this TC must
           identify the object with syntax AddressFamilyNumbers
           that specifies its type.

           The syntax and semantics of this object depend on the
           identified AddressFamilyNumbers object as follows:

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  MIB Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  in the ipsAuthInstanceAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthInstDescr could be modified to camouflage the existence
        of a rogue authorization instance;

   o  in the ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthIdentDescription could be modified to camouflage the
        existence of a rogue identity;

      - ipsAuthIdentRowStatus could be modified to add or delete a rogue
        identity;

      - ipsAuthIdentStorageType could be modified to make temporary rows
        permanent, or permanent rows temporary;

   o  in the ipsAuthIdentNameAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthIdentName could be modified to change the name of an
        existing identity;

      - ipsAuthIdentNameRowStatus could be modified to add or delete a
        name of an existing identity;

      - ipsAuthIdentNameStorageType could be modified to make temporary
        rows permanent, or permanent rows temporary;

   o  in the ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthIdentAddrType could be modified to change the type of
        address checking performed;

      - ipsAuthIdentAddrStart could be modified to change the start of
        the allowed range;

      - ipsAuthIdentAddrEnd could be modified to change the end of the
        allowed range;

      - ipsAuthIdentAddrRowStatus could be modified to add or delete the
        checking of an address range;

      - ipsAuthIdentAddrStorageType could be modified to make temporary
        rows permanent, or permanent rows temporary;

   o  in the ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthCredAuthMethod could be modified to change the type of
        authentication to be used;

      - ipsAuthCredRowStatus could be modified to add or delete checking
        of credentials;

      - ipsAuthCredStorageType could be modified to make temporary rows
        permanent, or permanent rows temporary;

   o  in the ipsAuthCredChapAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthCredChapUserName could be modified to change the CHAP
        user name for a credential;

      - ipsAuthCredChapRowStatus could be modified to add or delete CHAP
        attributes for credentials;

      - ipsAuthCredChapStorageType could be modified to make temporary
        rows permanent, or permanent rows temporary;

   o  in the ipsAuthCredSrpAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthCredSrpUserName could be modified to change the SRP user
        name for a credential;

      - ipsAuthCredSrpRowStatus could be modified to add or delete SRP
        attributes for credentials;

      - ipsAuthCredSrpStorageType could be modified to make temporary
        rows permanent, or permanent rows temporary;

   o  in the ipsAuthCredKerbAttributesTable:

      - ipsAuthCredKerbPrincipal could be modified to change the
        Kerberos principal for a credential;





Bakke & Muchow              Standards Track                    [Page 36]

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


      - ipsAuthCredKerbRowStatus could be modified to add or delete
        Kerberos attributes for credentials;

      - ipsAuthCredKerbStorageType could be modified to make temporary
        rows permanent, or permanent rows temporary;

   Note that removal of legitimate credentials can result in either
   denial of service or weakening the requirements for access of a
   particular service.  Note also that some types of credentials, such
   as CHAP or SRP, also require passwords or verifiers to be associated
   with the credential.  These are managed outside this MIB module.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  All tables (specifically: ipsAuthInstanceAttributesTable,
      ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable, ipsAuthIdentNameAttributesTable,
      ipsAuthIdentAddrAttributesTable, ipsAuthCredentialAttributesTable,
      ipsAuthCredChapAttributesTable, ipsAuthCredSrpAttributesTable, and
      ipsAuthCredKerbAttributesTable) provide the ability to find out
      which names, addresses, and credentials would be required to
      access services on the managed system.  If these credentials are
      easily spoofed (particularly the name or address), read access to
      this MIB module must be tightly controlled.  When used with
      pointers from another MIB module to rows in the
      ipsAuthIdentAttributesTable, this MIB module provides information
      about which entities are authorized to connect to which entities.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   In many implementations, the objects in this MIB module can be read
   and modified via other mechanisms or protocols in addition to this
   MIB module.  For the system to be secure, other mechanisms that can
   read and modify the contents of this MIB module must also address the
   above issues, and handle the threats outlined in [RFC3411], section
   1.4.

   Given the sensitivity of information contained in this MIB module, it
   is strongly recommended that encryption (SNMPv3 with a securityLevel
   of authPriv [RFC3411]) be used for all access to objects in this MIB
   module.

9.2.  Other Security Considerations

   An identity consists of a set of names (e.g., an iSCSI Initiator
   Name), addresses (e.g., an IP address or Fibre Channel World Wide
   Name (WWN)), and credentials (e.g., a CHAP user name).

   To match an identity, one must match:

   o  One of the IdentNames belonging to the IdentIndex, unless there
      are no IdentNames for the IdentIndex, and

   o  One of the IdentAddrs belonging to the IdentIndex, unless there
      are no IdentAddrs for the IdentIndex, and

   o  One of the IdentCreds belonging to the IdentIndex, unless there
      are no Creds for the IdentIndex.

   Note that if any of the above lists are empty for a given IdentIndex,
   any identifier of that type is considered to match the identity.  The
   non-empty lists will still be checked.  For example, if the
   IdentAddrs list is empty for the IndentIndex, but there are entries
   in IdentNames and IdentCreds, any address will be considered a match,
   as long as the offered name and credential match one of the
   IdentNames and IdentCreds, respectively.

   This leaves a possible security window while adding and removing
   entries from one of these lists.  For example, an identity could
   consist of no IdentNames, no IdentAddrs, and exactly one IdentCred.
   If that IdentCred was to be updated, several methods could be used:






Bakke & Muchow              Standards Track                    [Page 38]

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


   o  The UserName or Principal could be simply written in the
      appropriate table, if the credential's type remained the same
      (recommended).

   o  The new credential could be added, then the old deleted
      (recommended).

   o  The new credential could be added, and the old deleted in the same
      SNMP request (recommended, but do the add first).

   o  The old credential could be deleted, then the new added (Don't
      use!).

   Of the above methods, the last leaves a window in which the list is
   empty, possibly allowing unconstrained access to the resource making
   use of this MIB.  This method should never be used for Names, Addrs,
   or Creds.

   The use of the third method, adding and deleting within the same
   request, should be used with care.  It is recommended that within the
   request, the add be done first.  Otherwise, an implementation may
   attempt to perform these operations in order, potentially leaving a
   window.

   The first two methods are recommended.

   Care must also be taken when updating the IdentAddrs for an identity.
   Each IdentAddr specifies a range of addresses that match the
   identity, and has an address type, starting address, and ending
   address.  Modifying these one at a time can open a temporary window
   where a larger range of addresses are allowed.  For example, a single
   address is specified using IdentAddrType = ipv4, IdentAddrStart =
   IdentAddrEnd = 192.0.2.5.  We want to update this to specify the
   single address 192.0.2.34.  If the end address is updated first, we
   temporarily allow the range 192.0.2.5 .. 192.0.2.34, which is not
   what we want.  Similarly, if we change from 192.0.2.34 back to
   192.0.2.5, and we update IdentAddrStart first, we end up with the
   range again.  To handle this, an application must either:

   o  update both IdentAddrStart and IdentAddrEnd in the same SNMP set
      request, or

   o  add the new IdentAddrStart and IdentAddrEnd with a new
      IdentAddrIndex, then delete the old one, using the methods shown
      before.

RFC 4545                 IPS Authorization MIB                  May 2006


   Since the value of IdentAddrType specifies the formats of
   IdentAddrStart and IdentAddrEnd, modification of IdentAddrType is not
   allowed for an existing row.
