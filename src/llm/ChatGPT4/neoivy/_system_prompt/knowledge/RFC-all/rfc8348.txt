RFC 8348                YANG Hardware Management              March 2018


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model [RFC7950] for the management
   of hardware on a single server.

   The data model includes configuration and system state (status
   information and counters for the collection of statistics).

   The data model in this document is designed to be compliant with the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  For
   implementations that do not yet support NMDA, a temporary module with
   system state data only is defined in Appendix A.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  server

   o  configuration

   o  system state

   o  operational state

   o  intended configuration

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  Objectives

   This section describes some of the design objectives for the hardware
   data model.

   o  The hardware data model needs to support many common properties
      used to identify hardware components.

   o  Important information and states about hardware components need to
      be collected from devices that support the hardware data model.

   o  The hardware data model should be suitable for new implementations
      to use as is.

   o  The hardware data model defined in this document can be
      implemented on a system that also implements ENTITY-MIB; thus, the
      mapping between the hardware data model and ENTITY-MIB should be
      clear.

   o  The data model should support pre-provisioning of hardware
      components.

3.  Hardware Data Model

   following structure:

3.1.  The Components Lists

   The data model for hardware presented in this document uses a flat
   list of components.  Each component in the list is identified by its
   name.  Furthermore, each component has a mandatory "class" leaf.

   The "iana-hardware" module defines YANG identities for the hardware
   types in the IANA-maintained "IANA-ENTITY-MIB" registry.

   The "class" leaf is a YANG identity that describes the type of the
   hardware.  Vendors are encouraged to either directly use one of the
   common IANA-defined identities or derive a more specific identity
   from one of them.

RFC 8348                YANG Hardware Management              March 2018


4.  Relationship to ENTITY-MIB

   If the device implements the ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933], each entry in the
   "/hardware/component" list in the operational state is mapped to one
   EntPhysicalEntry.  Objects that are writable in the MIB are mapped to
   "config true" nodes in the "/hardware/component" list, except
   entPhysicalSerialNum, which is writable in the MIB but "config false"
   in the YANG module.

   The "physical-index" leaf MUST contain the value of the corresponding
   entPhysicalEntry's entPhysicalIndex.

   The "class" leaf is mapped to both entPhysicalClass and
   entPhysicalVendorType.  If the value of the "class" leaf is an
   identity that either is derived from or is one of the identities in
   the "iana-hardware" module, then entPhysicalClass contains the
   corresponding IANAPhysicalClass enumeration value.  Otherwise,
   entPhysicalClass contains the IANAPhysicalClass value "other(1)".
   Vendors are encouraged to define an identity (derived from an
   identity in "iana-hardware" if possible) for each enterprise-specific
   registration identifier used for entPhysicalVendorType and use that
   identity for the "class" leaf.

   The following table lists the YANG data nodes with corresponding
   objects in the ENTITY-MIB.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
   "iana-hardware" YANG module.

   The "iana-hardware" YANG module is intended to reflect the
   "IANA-ENTITY-MIB" MIB module so that if a new enumeration is added to
   the "IANAPhysicalClass" textual convention, the same class is added
   as an identity derived from "ianahw:hardware-class".

   When the "iana-hardware" YANG module is updated, a new "revision"
   statement must be added in front of the existing revision statements.

8.1.  URI Registrations

   This document registers three URIs in the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688].  Per the format in RFC 3688, the following registrations
   have been made.

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-hardware
     Registrant Contact: The IESG.
     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-hardware
     Registrant Contact: The IESG.
     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-hardware-state
     Registrant Contact: The IESG.
     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

8.2.  YANG Module Registrations

   This document registers three YANG modules in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020].

     name:         iana-hardware
     namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-hardware
     prefix:       ianahw
     reference:    RFC 8348

     name:         ietf-hardware
     namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-hardware
     prefix:       hw
     reference:    RFC 8348

     name:         ietf-hardware-state
     namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-hardware-state
     prefix:       hw-state
     reference:    RFC 8348

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module
   "ietf-hardware" that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config
   true, which is the default).  These data nodes may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  Write
   operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /hardware/component/admin-state:  Setting this node to 'locked' or
      'shutting-down' can cause disruption of services ranging from
      those running on a port to those on an entire device, depending on
      the type of component.




Bierman, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 39]

RFC 8348                YANG Hardware Management              March 2018


   Some of the readable data nodes in these YANG modules may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /hardware/component:  The leafs in this list expose information about
      the physical components in a device, which may be used to identify
      the vendor, model, version, and specific device-identification
      information of each system component.

   /hardware/component/sensor-data/value:  This node may expose the
      values of particular physical sensors in a device.

   /hardware/component/state:  Access to this node allows one to figure
      out what the active and standby resources in a device are.

       "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
        monitoring hardware.

        This data model is designed as a temporary solution for
        implementations that do not yet support the Network Management
        Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in RFC 8342.  Such an
        implementation cannot implement the module 'ietf-hardware'
        properly, since without NMDA support, it is not possible to
        distinguish between instances of nodes in the running
        configuration and operational states.

        The data model in this module is the same as the data model in
        'ietf-hardware', except all nodes are marked as 'config false'.

        If a server that implements this module but doesn't support NMDA
        also supports configuration of hardware components, it SHOULD
        also implement the module 'ietf-hardware' in the configuration
        datastores.  The corresponding state data is found in the
        '/hw-state:hardware' subtree.

RFC 8348                YANG Hardware Management              March 2018


            When the server detects a new hardware component, it
            initializes a list entry in the operational state.

            If the server does not support configuration of hardware
            components, list entries in the operational state are
            initialized with values for all nodes as detected by the
            implementation.

            Otherwise, this procedure is followed:

              1. If there is an entry in the '/hardware/component' list
                 in the intended configuration with values for the nodes
                 'class', 'parent', and 'parent-rel-pos' that are equal
                 to the detected values, then:

              1a. If the configured entry has a value for 'mfg-name'
                  that is equal to the detected value or if the
                  'mfg-name' value cannot be detected, then the list
                  entry in the operational state is initialized with the
                  configured values for all configured nodes, including
                  the 'name'.

                  Otherwise, the list entry in the operational state is
                  initialized with values for all nodes as detected by
                  the implementation.  The implementation may raise an
                  alarm that informs about the 'mfg-name' mismatch
                  condition.  How this is done is outside the scope of
                  this document.

              1b. Otherwise (i.e., there is no matching configuration
                  entry), the list entry in the operational state is
                  initialized with values for all nodes as detected by
                  the implementation.

            If the '/hardware/component' list in the intended
            configuration is modified, then the system MUST behave as if
            it re-initializes itself and follow the procedure in (1).";
