1.  Introduction

   This memo defines an update to RFC 1354, "IP Forwarding Table MIB",
   for Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).  That document was
   developed by the Router Requirements Working Group as an update to
   RFC 1213's ipRouteTable, with the display of multiple routes as
   a primary objective.  The significant difference between this MIB and
   RFC 1354 is the recognition (explicitly discussed but by consensus
   left to future work) that CIDR routes may have the
   same network number but different network masks.  Note that this MIB
   obsoletes a number of objects from RFC 1354.  The reader should pay
   careful attention to the STATUS field.

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of three
   major components.  They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [1], - the mechanisms used
        for describing and naming objects for the purpose of
        management.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2], - the core set of
        managed objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o    the protocol, RFC 1157 [6] and/or RFC 1905 [4], - the
        protocol for accessing managed information.

   Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [3], and conformance
   statements are defined in RFC 1904 [5].

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB
   are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For
   human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
   descriptor, to refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

   The MIB consists of two tables and two global objects.

   (1)  The object ipForwardNumber indicates the number of
        current routes.  This is primarily to avoid having to
        read the table in order to determine this number.

   (2)  The ipForwardTable updates the RFC 1213 ipRouteTable to
        display multipath IP Routes.  This is in turn obsoleted
        by the ipCidrRouteTable.

   (3)  The ipCidrRouteTable updates the RFC 1213 ipRouteTable to
        display multipath IP Routes having the same network
        number but differing network masks.
