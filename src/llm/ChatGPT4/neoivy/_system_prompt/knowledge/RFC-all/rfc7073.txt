1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a response set for describing the reputation
   of an email identifier.  A "response set" in this context is defined
   in [RFC7070] and is used to describe assertions a reputation service
   provider can make about email identifiers as well as metadata that
   can be included in such a reply beyond the base set specified there.

   An atomic reputation response is called a "reputon", defined in
   [RFC7071].  That document also defines a media type to contain a
   reputon for transport, and creates a registry for reputation
   applications and the interesting parameters of each.

2.  Terminology and Definitions

   This section defines terms used in the rest of the document.

2.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [KEYWORDS].

2.2.  Email Definitions

   Commonly used definitions describing entities in the email
   architecture are defined and discussed in [EMAIL-ARCH].

2.3.  Other Definitions

   Other terms of importance in this document are defined in [RFC7070],
   the base document for the reputation services work.

3.  Discussion

   The expression of reputation about an email identifier requires
   extensions of the base set defined in [RFC7070].  This document
   defines and registers some common assertions about an entity found in
   a piece of [MAIL].

3.1.  Assertions

   The "email-id" reputation application recognizes the following
   assertions:

   abusive:  The subject identifier is associated with sending or
      handling email of a personally abusive, threatening, or otherwise
      harassing nature

   fraud:  The subject identifier is associated with the sending or
      handling of fraudulent email, such as "phishing" (some good
      discussion on this topic can be found in [IODEF-PHISHING])

   invalid-recipients:  The subject identifier is associated with
      delivery attempts to nonexistent recipients

   malware:  The subject identifier is associated with the sending or
      handling of malware via email

   spam:  The subject identifier is associated with the sending or
      handling of unwanted bulk email

   For all assertions, the "rating" scale is linear: a value of 0.0
   means there is no data to support the assertion, a value of 1.0 means
   all accumulated data support the assertion, and the intervening
   values have a linear relationship (i.e., a score of "x" is twice as
   strong of an assertion as a value of "x/2").

3.2.  Response Set Extensions

   The "email-id" reputation application recognizes the following
   OPTIONAL extensions to the basic response set defined in [RFC7071]:

   email-id-identity:  A token indicating the source of the identifier;
      that is, where the subject identifier was found in the message.
      This MUST be one of:

      dkim: The signing domain, i.e., the value of the "d=" tag, found
            on a valid DomainKeys Identified Mail [DKIM] signature in
            the message

      ipv4: The IPv4 address of the client

      ipv6: The IPv6 address of the client

      rfc5321.helo:  The RFC5321.HELO value used by the client (see
            [SMTP])

      rfc5321.mailfrom:  The RFC5321.MailFrom value of the envelope of
            the message (see [SMTP])

      rfc5322.from:  The RFC5322.From field of the message (see [MAIL])

      spf:  The domain name portion of the identifier (RFC5321.MailFrom
            or RFC5321.HELO) verified by [SPF]

   sources:  A token relating a count of the number of sources of data
      that contributed to the reported reputation.  This is in contrast
      to the "sample-size" parameter, which indicates the total number
      of reports across all reporting sources.

   A reply that does not contain the "identity" or "sources" extensions
   is making a non-specific statement about how the reputation returned
   was developed.  A client can use or ignore such a reply at its
   discretion.

3.3.  Identifiers

   In evaluating an email message on the basis of reputation, there can
   be more than one identifier in the message needing to be validated.
   For example, a message may have different email addresses in the
   RFC5321.MailFrom parameter and the RFC5322.From header field.  The
   RFC5321.Helo identifier will obviously be different.  Consequently,
   the software evaluating the email message may need to query for the
   reputation of more than one identifier.

RFC 7073             Email Identifiers Response Set        November 2013


   The purpose of including the identity in the reply is to expose to
   the client the context in which the identifier was extracted from the
   message under evaluation.  In particular, several of the items listed
   are extracted verbatim from the message and have not been subjected
   to any kind of validation, while a domain name present in a valid
   DKIM signature has some more reliable semantics associated with it.
   Computing or using reputation information about unauthenticated
   identifiers has substantially reduced value, but can sometimes be
   useful when combined.  For example, a reply that indicates a message
   contained one of these low-value identifiers with a high "spam"
   rating might not be worthy of notice, but a reply that indicates a
   message contained several of them could be grounds for suspicion.

   A client interested in checking these weaker identifiers would issue
   a query about each of them using the same assertion (e.g., "spam"),
   and then collate the results to determine which ones and how many of
   them came back with ratings indicating content of concern, and take
   action accordingly.  For stronger identifiers, decisions can
   typically be made based on a few or even just one of them.

3.4.  Query Extensions

   A query within this application can include the OPTIONAL query
   parameter "identity" to indicate which specific identity is of
   interest to the query.  Legal values are the same as those listed in
   Section 3.2.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo presents one action for IANA, namely the registration of
   the reputation application "email-id".

4.1.  Registration of 'email-id' Reputation Application

   This section registers the "email-id" reputation application, as per
   the IANA Considerations section of [RFC7071].  The registration
   parameters are as follows:

   o  Application symbolic name: email-id

   o  Short description: Evaluates DNS domain names or IP addresses
      found in email identifiers

   o  Defining document: [RFC7073]

   o  Status: current

RFC 7073             Email Identifiers Response Set        November 2013


   o  Subject: A string appropriate to the identifier of interest (see
      Section 3.2 of this document)

   o  Application-specific query parameters:

      identity:  (current) as defined in Section 3.4 of this document

   o  Application-specific assertions:

      abusive:  (current) as defined in Section 3.1 of this document

      fraud:  (current) as defined in Section 3.1 of this document

      invalid-recipients:  (current) as defined in Section 3.1 of this
            document

      malware:  (current) as defined in Section 3.1 of this document

      spam: (current) as defined in Section 3.1 of this document

   o  Application-specific response set extensions:

      identity:  (current) as defined in Section 3.2 of this document

5.  Security Considerations

   This document is primarily an IANA action and doesn't describe any
   protocols or protocol elements that might introduce new security
   concerns.

   Security considerations relevant to email and email authentication
   can be found in most of the documents listed in the References
   sections below.  Information specific to use of reputation services
   can be found in [CONSIDERATIONS].

Appendix A.  Positive vs. Negative Assertions

   [CONSIDERATIONS] some current theories about reputation, namely that
   it will possibly have more impact to develop positive reputations and
   focus on giving preferential treatment to content or sources that
   earn those.  However, the assertions defined in this document are all
   clearly negative in nature.

   In effect, this document is recording current use of reputation and
   of this framework in particular.  It is expected that, in the future,
   the application being registered here will be augmented, and other
   applications registered, that focus more on positive assertions
   rather than negative ones.
