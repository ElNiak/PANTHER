1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes a set of managed objects that allow the
   delegation of management scripts to distributed managers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [21].

2.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

      o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

      o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for
          the purpose of management. The first version of this Structure
          of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described
          in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215
          [4]. The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58,
          RFC 2578 [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


      o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
          first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1
          and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the
          SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
          track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
          [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message
          protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC
          2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

      o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
          first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
          described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
          operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
          [13].

      o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14]
          and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC
          2275 [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   The Script MIB module defined in this memo can be used to delegate
   management functions to distributed managers. Management functions
   are defined as management scripts written in a management scripting
   language. This MIB makes no assumptions about the language itself and
   even allows distribution of compiled native code, if an
   implementation is able to execute native code under the control of
   this MIB.

   The Script MIB defines a standard interface for the delegation of
   management functions based on the Internet management framework. In
   particular, it provides the following capabilities:

   1.   Capabilities to transfer management scripts to a distributed
        manager.



Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   2.   Capabilities for initiating, suspending, resuming and
        terminating management scripts.

   3.   Capabilities to transfer arguments for management scripts.

   4.   Capabilities to monitor and control running management scripts.

   5.   Capabilities to transfer the results produced by running
        management scripts.

   This memo does not address any additional topics like the generation
   of notifications or how to address remote agents from a Script MIB
   implementation.

3.1.  Terms

   This section defines the terms used throughout this memo.

   o    A `distributed manager' is a processing entity which is capable
        of performing network management functions. For the scope of
        this memo, a distributed manager is assumed to implement the
        Script MIB.

   o    A `higher-level manager', or just `manager', is a processing
        entity or human who initiates and controls the operations
        performed by one or more distributed managers.

   o    A `management script' is a set of instructions written in an
        executable language which implements a management function.

   o    A `management scripting language' is a language used to write
        management scripts. Note, the term scripting language does not
        imply that the language must have the characteristics of
        scripting languages (e.g. string orientation, interpretation,
        weak typing). The MIB defined in this memo also allows to
        control management scripts written in arbitrary compiled system
        programming languages.

   o    A `distributed manager' can be decomposed into an `SNMP entity'
        which implements the Script MIB defined in this memo and the
        `runtime system' that executes scripts. The Script MIB sees the
        runtime system as the managed resource which is controlled by
        the MIB.

        The runtime system can act as an SNMP application, according to
        the SNMP architecture defined in RFC 2271 [1]. For example, a
        runtime system which sends SNMP requests to other SNMP entities
        will act as a command generator application. The SNMP



Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


        applications in the runtime system may use the same SNMP engine
        which also serves the command responder application used to
        implement the Script MIB, but they are not required to do so.

   o    A `launch button' is the conceptual button used to start the
        execution of a management script. It assignes control parameters
        to a management script. In particular, it defines the ownership
        of the scripts started from a launch button. The ownership can
        be used by the language runtime system to enforce security
        profiles on a running management script.

4.  Requirements and Design Issues

   This section discusses some general requirements that have influenced
   the design of the Script MIB.

   o    The Script MIB must not make any assumptions about specific
        languages or runtime systems.

   o    The Script MIB must provide mechanisms that help to avoid new
        management problems (e.g. script version problems).

   o    The Script MIB must provide SNMP interfaces to all functions
        required to delegate management scripts. However, other
        protocols might be used in addition if they provide a
        significant improvement in terms of convenience for
        implementation or performance.

   o    The Script MIB must be organized so that access can be
        controlled effectively by using view-based access control [15].

   The following sections discuss some design issues in more detail.

4.1.  Script Languages

   The Script MIB defined in this memo makes no assumption about the
   script language. This MIB can therefore be used in combination with
   different languages (such as Tcl or Java) and/or different versions
   of the same language. No assumptions are made about the format in
   which management scripts are transferred.

   The Script MIB provides access to information about the language
   versions supported by a Script MIB implementation so that a manager
   can learn about the capabilities provided by an implementation.
   Languages and language versions are identified as follows:






Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   1.   The language is identified by an object identifier. Object
        identifier for well-known languages will be registered by the
        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Enterprise specific
        languages can also be registered in the enterprise specific OID
        subtree.

   2.   A particular version of a language is identified by a language
        version number. The combination of a language object identifier
        and a language version is in most cases sufficient to decide
        whether a script can be executed or not.

   3.   Different implementations of the same language version might
        have differences due to ambiguities in the language definition
        or additional language features provided by an implementor. An
        additional object identifier value is provided which identifies
        the organization which provides the implementation of a
        language. This might be used by scripts that require a
        particular implementation of a language.

   4.   Finally, there might be different versions of a language
        implementation. A version number for the language implementation
        is provided so that the manager can also distinguish between
        different implementations from the same organization of a
        particular language version.

   The version numbers can either be used by a manager to select the
   language version required to execute a particular script or to select
   a script that fits the language versions supported by a particular
   Script MIB implementation.

   An additional table lists language extensions that provide features
   not provided by the core language. Language extensions are usually
   required to turn a general purpose language into a management
   language. In many cases, language extensions will come in the form of
   libraries that provide capabilities like sending SNMP requests to
   remote SNMP agents or accessing the local MIB instrumentation. Every
   extension is associated with a language and carries its own version
   numbers.

4.2.  Script Transfer

   There are two different ways to transfer management scripts to a
   distributed manager. The first approach requires that the manager
   pushes the script to the distributed manager. This is therefore
   called the `push model'. The second approach is the `pull model'
   where the manager tells the distributed manager the location of the
   script and the distributed manager retrieves the script itself.




Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   The MIB defined in this memo supports both models. The `push model'
   is realized by a table which allows a manager to write scripts by
   sending a sequence of SNMP set requests. The script can be split into
   several fragments in order to deal with SNMP message size
   limitations.

   The `pull model' is realized by the use of Uniform Resource Locators
   (URLs) [17] that point to the script source. The manager writes the
   URL which points to the script source to the distributed manager by
   sending an SNMP set request. The distributed manager is then
   responsible for retrieving the document using the protocol specified
   in the URL. This allows the use of protocols like FTP [18] or HTTP
   [19] to transfer large management scripts efficiently.

   The Script MIB also allows management scripts that are hard-wired
   into the Script MIB implementation. Built-in scripts can either be
   implemented in a language runtime system, or they can be built
   natively into the Script MIB implementation. The implementation of
   the `push model' or the `pull model' is not required.

   Scripts can be stored in non-volatile storage. This allows a
   distributed manager to restart scripts if it is restarted (off-line
   restart). A manager is not required to push scripts back into the
   distributed manager after a restart if the script is backed up in
   non-volatile storage.

   Every script is identified by an administratively assigned name. This
   name may be used to derive the name which is used to access the
   script in non-volatile storage. This mapping is implementation
   specific. However, the mapping must ensure that the Script MIB
   implementation can handle scripts with the same administrative name
   owned by different managers. One way to achieve this is to use the
   script owner in addition to the script name in order to derive the
   internal name used to refer to a particular script in non-volatile
   storage.

4.3.  Script Execution

   The Script MIB permits execution of several instances of the same or
   different management scripts. Script arguments are passed as OCTET
   STRING values. Scripts return a single result value which is also an
   OCTET STRING value. The semantic interpretation of result values is
   left to the invoking manager or other management scripts. A script
   invoker must understand the format and semantics of both the
   arguments and the results of the scripts that it invokes.






Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   Scripts can also export complex results through a MIB interface. This
   allows a management application to access and use script results in
   the same manner as it processes any other MIB data. However, the
   Script MIB does not provide any special support for the
   implementation of MIBs through scripts.

   Runtime errors terminate active scripts. An exit code and a human
   readable error message is left in the MIB. A notification containing
   the exit code, the error message and a timestamp is generated when a
   script terminates with an error exit code.

   Script arguments and results do not have any size limitations other
   than the limits imposed by the SMI and the SNMP protocol. However,
   implementations of this MIB might have further restrictions. A script
   designer might therefore choose to return the results via other
   mechanisms if the script results can be very large. One possibility
   is to return a URL as a script result which points to the file
   containing the script output.

   Executing scripts have a status object attached which allows script
   execution to be suspended, resumed, or aborted.  The precise
   semantics of the suspend and resume operations are language and
   runtime system dependent. Some runtime systems may choose to not
   implement the suspend/resume operations.

   A history of finished scripts is kept in the MIB. A script invoker
   can collect results at a later point in time (offline operation).
   Control objects can be used to control how entries in the history are
   aged out if the table fills up.

5.  The Structure of the MIB

   This section presents the structure of the MIB. The objects are
   arranged into the following groups:

   o    language group (smLanguageGroup)

   o    script group (smScriptGroup)

   o    script code group (smCodeGroup)

   o    script launch group (smLaunchGroup)

   o    running script group (smRunGroup)

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


5.1.  The smLanguageGroup

   The smLanguageGroup is used to provide information about the
   languages and the language extensions supported by a Script MIB
   implementation.  This group includes two tables.  The smLangTable
   lists all languages supported by a Script MIB implementation and the
   smExtsnTable lists the extensions that are available for a given
   language.

5.2.  The smScriptGroup

   The smScriptGroup consists of a single table, called the
   smScriptTable. The smScriptTable lists all scripts known to a Script
   MIB implementation. The smScriptTable contains objects that allow the
   following operations:

   o    download scripts from a URL (pull model)

   o    read scripts from local non-volatile storage

   o    store scripts in local non-volatile storage

   o    delete scripts from local non-volatile storage

   o    list permanent scripts (that can not be changed or removed)

   o    read and modify the script status (enabled, disabled, editing)

   A status object called smScriptOperStatus allows a manager to obtain
   the current status of a script. It is also used to provide an error
   indication if an attempt to invoke one of the operations listed above
   fails. The status change of a script can be requested by modifying
   the associated smScriptAdminStatus object.

   The source of a script is defined by the smScriptSource object. This
   object may contain a URL pointing to a remote location which provides
   access to the management script. The script source is read from the
   smCodeTable (described below) or from non-volatile storage if the
   smScriptSource object contains an empty URL. The smScriptStorageType
   object is used to distinguish between scripts read from non-volatile
   storage and scripts read from the smCodeTable.

   Scripts are automatically loaded once the smScriptAdminStatus object
   is set to `enabled'.  Loading a script includes retrieving the script
   (probably from a remote location), compiling the script for languages
   that require a compilation step, and making the code available to the
   runtime system.  The smScriptOperStatus object is used to indicate
   the status of the loading process. This object will start in the



Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                     [Page 9]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   state `retrieving', switch to the state `compiling' and finally reach
   the state `enabled'. Errors during the retrieval or compilation phase
   will result in an error state such as `compilationFailed'.

5.3.  The smCodeGroup

   The smCodeGroup consists of a single table, called the smCodeTable,
   which provides the ability to transfer and modify scripts via SNMP
   set requests.  In particular, the smCodeTable allows the following
   operations:

   o    download scripts via SNMP (push model)

   o    modify scripts via SNMP (editing)

   The smCodeTable lists the code of a script. A script can be
   fragmented over multiple rows of the smCodeTable in order to handle
   SNMP message size limitations. Modifications of the smCodeTable are
   only possible if the associated smScriptOperStatus object has the
   value `editing'.  The Script MIB implementation reloads the modified
   script code once the smScriptOperStatus changes to `enabled' again.

   The implementation of the smCodeGroup is optional.

5.4.  The smLaunchGroup

   The smLaunchGroup contains a single table, the smLaunchTable. An
   entry in the smLaunchTable represents a launch button which can be
   used to start a script. The smLaunchTable allows the following
   operations:

   o    associate a script with an owner used during script execution

   o    provide arguments and parameters for script invocation

   o    invoke scripts with a single set operation

   The smLaunchTable describes scripts and their parameters that are
   ready to be launched. An entry in the smLaunchTable attaches an
   argument to a script and control values which, for example, define
   the maximum number of times that a script invoked from a particular
   row in the smLaunchTable may be running concurrently.

   An entry in the smLaunchTable also defines the owner which will be
   used to associate permissions with the script execution.

5.5.  The smRunGroup

   The smRunGroup contains a single table, called the smRunTable, which
   lists all scripts that are currently running or have terminated
   recently. The smRunTable contains objects that allow the following
   operations:

   o    retrieve status information from running scripts

   o    control running scripts (suspend, resume, abort)

   o    retrieve results from recently terminated scripts

   o    control the remaining maximum lifetime of a running script

   o    control how long script results are accessible

   Every row in the smRunTable contains the argument passed during
   script invocation, the result produced by the script and the script
   exit code.  The smRunTable also provides information about the
   current run state as well as start and end time-stamps. There are
   three writable objects in the smRunTable. The smRunLifeTime object
   defines the maximum time a running script may run before it is
   terminated by the Script MIB implementation. The smRunExpireTime
   object defines the time that a completed script can stay in the
   smRunTable before it is aged out. The smRunControl object allows
   running scripts to be suspended, resumed, or aborted.

            The script controlled by this row is written into local

            (a) the URL contained in the smScriptSource object is empty

            Setting this object to the special value 0 will start
            the script with a self-generated smRunIndex value. The
            consequence is that the script invoker has no reliable
            way to determine the smRunIndex value for this script
            invocation and that the invoker has therefore no way
            to obtain the results from this script invocation. The
            special value 0 is however useful for scheduled script
            invocations.

            If this object is set, the following checks must be
            performed:

            1) The value of the smLaunchOperStatus object in this
               entry of the smLaunchTable must be `enabled'.
            2) The values of smLaunchScriptOwner and
               smLaunchScriptName of this row must identify an
               existing entry in the smScriptTable.
            3) The value of smScriptOperStatus of this entry must
               be `enabled'.
            4) The principal performing the set operation must have
               read access to the script. This must be checked by
               calling the isAccessAllowed abstract service interface
               defined in RFC 2271 on the row in the smScriptTable
               identified by smLaunchScriptOwner and smLaunchScriptName.
               The isAccessAllowed abstract service interface must be
               called on all columnar objects in the smScriptTable with
               a MAX-ACCESS value different than `not-accessible'. The
               test fails as soon as a call indicates that access is
               not allowed.
            5) If the value provided by the set operation is not 0,
               a check must be made that the value is currently not
               in use. Otherwise, if the value provided by the set
               operation is 0, a suitable unused value must be
               generated.
            6) The number of currently executing scripts invoked
               from this smLaunchTable entry must be less than
               smLaunchMaxRunning.

            Attempts to start a script will fail with an
            inconsistentValue error if one of the checks described
            above fails.

            Otherwise, if all checks have been passed, a new entry
            in the smRunTable will be created indexed by smLaunchOwner,
            smLaunchName and the new value for smRunIndex. The value

7.  Usage Examples

   This section presents some examples that explain how a manager can
   use the Script MIB defined in this memo. The purpose of these
   examples is to explain the steps that are normally used to delegate
   management scripts.

7.1.  Pushing a script via SNMP

   This example explains the steps performed by a manager to push a
   script into a distributed manager.

   1.   The manager first checks the smLanguageTable and the
        smExtensionTable in order to select the appropriate script or
        language.

   2.   The manager creates a row in the smScriptTable by issuing an
        SNMP set-request. The smScriptRowStatus object is set to
        `createAndWait' and the smScriptSource object is set to an empty
        string. The smScriptLanguage object is set to the language in
        which the script was written. The smScriptStorageType object is
        set to `volatile' to indicate that the script will be loaded via
        the smCodeTable.  The smScriptOwner is set to a string which
        identifies the principal who owns the new row. The smScriptName
        defines the administratively assigned unique name for the
        script.

   3.   The manager sets the smScriptRowStatus object to `active' and
        the smScriptAdminStatus object to `editing'.

   4.   The manager pushes the script to the distributed manager by
        issuing a couple of SNMP set-requests to fill the smCodeTable.

   5.   Once the whole script has been transferred, the manager sends a
        set-request to set the smScriptAdminStatus object to `enabled'.
        The Script MIB implementation now makes the script accessible to
        the runtime system. This might include the compilation of the
        script if the language requires a compilation step.

   6.   The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value
        is either `enabled' or one of the error status codes.  The
        script can only be used if the value of smScriptOperStatus is
        `enabled'.

   7.   If the manager wants to store the script in local non-volatile
        storage, it should send a set-request which changes the
        smScriptStorageType object to `nonVolatile'.

7.2.  Pulling a script from a URL

   This example explains the steps performed by a manager to cause a
   distributed manager to pull a script from a URL.

   1.   The manager first checks the smLanguageTable and the
        smExtensionTable in order to select the appropriate script or
        language.

   2.   The manager creates a row in the smScriptTable by issuing an
        SNMP set-request. The smScriptRowStatus object is set to
        `createAndWait' and the smScriptSource object is set to the URL
        which points to the script source. The smScriptLanguage object
        is set to the language in which the script was written. The
        smScriptOwner is set to a string which identifies the principal
        who owns the new row. The smScriptName defines the
        administratively assigned unique name for the script.

   3.   The manager sets the smScriptRowStatus object to `active'.

   4.   The manager sends a set-request to set the smScriptAdminStatus
        object to `enabled'. The Script MIB implementation now makes the
        script accessible to the runtime system. This causes a retrieval
        operation to pull the script from the URL stored in
        smScriptSource. This retrieval operation might be followed by a
        compile operation if the language requires a compilation step.

   5.   The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value
        is either `enabled' or one of the error status codes.  The
        script can only be used if the value of smScriptOperStatus is
        `enabled'.

   6.   If the manager wants to store the script in local non-volatile
        storage, it should send a set-request which changes the
        smScriptStorageType object to `nonVolatile'.

7.3.  Modifying an existing script

   This section explains how a manager can modify a script by sending
   SNMP set-requests.

   1.   First, the script is de-activated by setting the
        smScriptAdminStatus to `disabled'.

   2.   The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value
        is `disabled'.

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   3.   The manager sets smScriptSource to an empty string and
        smScriptAdminStatus to `editing'. This makes the script source
        available in the smCodeTable.

   4.   The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value
        is `editing'.

   5.   The manager sends SNMP set-requests to modify the script in the
        smCodeTable.

   6.   The manager sends a set-request to set the smScriptAdminStatus
        object to `enabled'. The Script MIB implementation now makes the
        script accessible to the runtime system. This might include the
        compilation of the script if the language requires a compilation
        step.

   7.   The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value
        is either `enabled' or one of the error status codes.  The
        script can only be used if the value of smScriptOperStatus is
        `enabled'.

7.4.  Removing an existing script

   This section explains how a manager can remove a script from a
   distributed manager.

   1.   First, the manager sets the smScriptAdminStatus to `disabled'.
        This will ensure that no new scripts can be started while
        running scripts finish their execution.

   2.   The manager polls the smScriptOperStatus object until the value
        is `disabled'.

   3.   The manager sends an SNMP set-request to change the
        smScriptRowStatus object to `destroy'. This will remove the row
        and all associated resources from the Script MIB implementation.

7.5.  Creating a launch button

   This section explains how a manager can create a launch button for
   starting a script.

   1.   The manager, who is identified by an smLaunchOwner value, first
        chooses a name for the new row in the smLaunchTable. The manager
        sends an SNMP set-request to set the smLaunchRowStatus object
        for this smLaunchOwner and smLaunchName to `createAndWait'.

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   2.   The manager fills the new smLaunchTable row with all required
        parameters. The smLaunchScriptOwner and smLaunchScriptName
        values point to the script that should be started from this
        launch button.

   3.   The manager sends a set-request to change smLaunchAdminStatus to
        `enabled' once the new smLaunchTable row is complete.

   4.   The manager polls the smLaunchOperStatus object until the value
        is `enabled'.

7.6.  Launching a script

   This section explains the suggested way to launch a script from a
   given launch button.

   1.   The manager first retrieves the value of smLaunchRunIndexNext
        from the launch button selected to start the script.

   2.   The manager sends an SNMP set-request to set the smLaunchStart
        object to the value obtained in step 1. This will launch the
        script if all necessary pre-conditions are satisfied (see the
        definition of smLaunchStart for more details). The manager can
        also provide the smLaunchArgument in the same set-request that
        is used to start the script. Upon successful start, a new row
        will be created in the smRunTable indexed by smLaunchOwner,
        smLaunchName and the value written to smLaunchStart.

   Note, the first step is not required. A manager can also try to guess
   an unused value for smRunIndex if he wants to start script in a
   single transaction. A manager can also use the special value 0 if he
   does not care about the results produced by the script.

7.7.  Terminating a script

   This section explains two ways to terminate a running script. The
   first approach is as follows:

   1.   The manager sets the smRunControl object of the running script
        or the smLaunchControl object of the launch button used to start
        the running script to `abort'. Setting smLaunchControl will
        abort all running scripts started from the launch button while
        smRunControl will only abort the running script associated with
        the smRunControl instance.







Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                    [Page 44]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   The second way to terminate a script is to set the smRunLifeTime to
   zero which causes the runtime system to terminate the script with a
   `lifeTimeExceeded' exit code:

   1.   The manager changes the value of smRunLifeTime to 0. This causes
        the Script MIB implementation to abort the script because the
        remaining life time has expired.

   Note, changing the smRunLifeTime value can also be used to increase
   the permitted lifetime of a running script. For example, a manager
   can choose to set smRunLifeTime to a small fixed time interval and
   increase the value periodically. This strategy has the nice effect
   that scripts terminate automatically if the manager loses contact
   with the Script MIB engine.

7.8.  Removing a launch button

   This section explains how a manager can remove a launch button from a
   distributed manager.

   1.   First, the manager sets the smLaunchAdminStatus to
        `disabled'. This will ensure that no new scripts can be started
        from this launch button while running script will finish their
        execution.

   2.   The manager polls the smLaunchOperStatus object until the value
        is `disabled'.

   3.   The manager sends an SNMP set-request to change the
        smLaunchRowStatus object to `destroy'. This will remove the row
        and all associated resources from the Script MIB implementation.

8.  VACM Configuration Examples

   This section shows how the view-based access control model defined in
   RFC 2275 [15] can be configured to control access to the script MIB.

8.1.  Sandbox for guests

   The first example demonstrates how to configure VACM to give the
   members of the VACM group "guest" limited access to the script MIB.
   The MIB views defined below give the members of the "guest" group a
   sandbox where they can install and start their own scripts, but not
   access any other scripts maintained by the Script MIB implementation.

      vacmAccessReadView."guest"."".usm.authNoPriv = "guestReadView"
      vacmAccessWriteView."guest"."".usm.authNoPriv = "guestWriteView"

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   The guestReadView grants read access to the smLangTable, the
   smExtsnTable and to all the table entries owned by "guest":

      guestReadView:
          smLangTable                       (included)
          smExtsnTable                      (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."guest"     (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."guest"        (included)

   The guestWriteView grants write access to all the table entries owned
   by "guest":

      guestWriteView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."guest"     (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."guest"        (included)

8.2.  Sharing scripts

   This example demonstrates how VACM can be used to share a repository
   of scripts between the members of the "senior" and the members of the
   "junior" VACM group:

      vacmAccessReadView."junior"."".usm.authNoPriv = "juniorReadView"
      vacmAccessWriteView."junior"."".usm.authNoPriv = "juniorWriteView"

      juniorReadView:
          smLangTable                       (included)
          smExtsnTable                      (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."junior"    (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."junior"       (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."utils"     (included)

      juniorWriteView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."junior"    (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."junior"       (included)

   The definitions above allow the members of the "junior" VACM group to
   start the scripts owned by "utils" in addition to the script the
   members of the "junior" VACM group installed themself.  This is
   accomplished by giving the members of "junior" read access to scripts
   in "utils".  This allows members of "junior" to create entries in the
   smLauchTable which refer to scripts in "utils", and to launch those
   scripts using these entries in the smLaunchTable.

      vacmAccessReadView."senior"."".usm.authNoPriv = "seniorReadView"
      vacmAccessWriteView."senior"."".usm.authNoPriv = "seniorWriteView"

      seniorReadView:
          smLangTable                       (included)
          smExtsnTable                      (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."senior"    (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."senior"       (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."utils"     (included)

      seniorWriteView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."senior"    (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."senior"       (included)
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."utils"     (included)

   The definitions for the members of the "senior" VACM group allow to
   start the scripts owned by "utils" in addition to the script the
   members of the "senior" VACM group installed themself. The third
   write access rule in the seniorWriteView also grants the permission
   to install scripts owned by "utils". The members of the "senior" VACM
   group therefore have the permissions to install and modify scripts
   that can be called by the members of the "junior" VACM group.

8.3.  Emergency scripts


   This example demonstrates how VACM can be used to allow the members
   of the "junior" VACM group to launch scripts that are executed with
   the permissions associated with the "emergency" owner. This works by
   adding the following rules to the juniorReadView and the
   juniorWriteView:

      juniorReadView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."emergency" (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."emergency"    (included)

      juniorWriteView
          smLaunchStart."emergency"         (included)
          smLaunchArgument."emergency"      (included)

   The rules added to the juniorReadView grant read access to the
   scripts, the launch buttons and the results owned by "emergency". The
   rules added to the juniorWriteView grant write permissions to the
   smLaunchStart and smLaunchArgument variables ownded by "emergency".
   Members of the "junior" VACM group can therefore start scripts that
   will execute under the owner "emergency".

          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."emergency" (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."emergency"    (included)

      seniorWriteView:
          smScriptObjects.*.*.*."emergency" (included)
          smRunObjects.*.*.*."emergency"    (included)

   The rules added to the seniorReadView and the seniorWriteView will
   give the members of the "senior" VACM group the rights to install
   emergency scripts and to configure appropriate launch buttons.

9.  IANA Considerations

   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for
   maintaining a MIB module which provides OID registrations for well-
   known languages. The IANA language registry is intented to reduce
   interoperability problems by providing a single list of well-known
   languages. However, it is of course still possible to register
   languages in private OID spaces. Registering languages in private
   spaces is especially attractive if a language is used for
   experimentation or if a language is only used in environments where
   the distribution of MIB modules with the language registration does
   not cause any maintenance problems.

   Any additions or changes to the list of languages registered via IANA
   require Designated Expert Review as defined in the IANA guidelines
   [20]. The Designated Expert will be selected by the IESG Area
   Director for the IETF Operations and Management Area.

10.  Security Considerations

   This MIB provides the ability to distribute applications written in
   an arbitrary language to remote systems in a network.  The security
   features of the languages available in a particular implementation
   should be taken into consideration when deploying an implementation
   of this MIB.

   To facilitate the provisioning of access control by a security
   administrator using the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM)
   defined in RFC 2275 [15] for tables in which multiple users may need
   to independently create or modify entries, the initial index is used
   as an "owner index". Such an initial index has a syntax of
   SnmpAdminString, and can thus be trivially mapped to a securityName
   or groupName as defined in VACM, in accordance with a security
   policy.





Levi & Schoenwaelder        Standards Track                    [Page 48]

RFC 2592                       Script MIB                       May 1999


   All entries in related tables belonging to a particular user will
   have the same value for this initial index.  For a given user's
   entries in a particular table, the object identifiers for the
   information in these entries will have the same subidentifiers
   (except for the "column" subidentifier) up to the end of the encoded
   owner index. To configure VACM to permit access to this portion of
   the table, one would create vacmViewTreeFamilyTable entries with the
   value of vacmViewTreeFamilySubtree including the owner index portion,
   and vacmViewTreeFamilyMask "wildcarding" the column subidentifier.
   More elaborate configurations are possible.

   The VACM access control mechanism described above provides control
   over SNMP access to Script MIB objects. There are a number of other
   access control issues that are outside of the scope of this MIB. For
   example, access control on URLs, especially those that use the file
   scheme, must be realized by the underlying operating system. A
   mapping of the owner index value to a local operating system security
   user identity should be used by an implementation of this MIB to
   control access to operating system resources when resolving URLs or
   executing scripts.
