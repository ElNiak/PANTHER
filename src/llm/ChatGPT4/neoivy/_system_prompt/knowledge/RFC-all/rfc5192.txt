       DHCP Options for Protocol for Carrying Authentication for
              Network Access (PANA) Authentication Agents

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document defines new DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 options that contain a
   list of IP addresses to locate one or more PANA (Protocol for
   carrying Authentication for Network Access) Authentication Agents
   (PAAs).  This is one of the methods that a PANA Client (PaC) can use
   to locate PAAs.

RFC 5192                    PAA DHCP Options                    May 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
   [RFC5191] defines a new Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
   [RFC3748] lower layer that uses IP between the protocol end-points.

   The PANA protocol is run between a PANA Client (PaC) and a PANA
   Authentication Agent (PAA) in order to perform authentication and
   authorization for the network access service.

   This document specifies DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options
   that allow PANA clients (PaCs) to discover PANA Authentication Agents
   (PAAs).  This is one of the methods for locating PAAs.

   The DHCP options defined in this document are used only as a PAA
   discovery mechanism.  These DHCP options MUST NOT be used to perform
   any negotiation of the use of PANA between the PaC and a PAA.

2.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the DHCP terminology defined in [RFC2131],
   [RFC2132], and [RFC3315].

   This document uses the PANA terminology defined in [RFC5191].  In
   particular, the following terms are defined:

      PANA Client (PaC):

         The client side of the protocol that resides in the access
         device (e.g., laptop, PDA, etc.).  It is responsible for
         providing the credentials in order to prove its identity
         (authentication) for network access authorization.  The PaC and
         the EAP peer are co-located in the same access device.

      PANA Authentication Agent (PAA):

         The protocol entity in the access network whose responsibility
         it is to verify the credentials provided by a PANA client (PaC)
         and authorize network access to the access device.  The PAA and

         the EAP authenticator (and optionally the EAP server) are
         colocated in the same node.

4.  PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv4 Option

   This DHCPv4 option carries a list of 32-bit (binary) IPv4 addresses
   indicating PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs) available to the PANA
   client (PaC).

   The DHCPv4 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown
   in Figure 1.

      option-code:        OPTION_PANA_AGENT (136).

      option-length:      Length of the 'options' field in octets;
                          MUST be a multiple of four (4).

      PAA IPv4 Address:   IPv4 address of a PAA for the client to use.
                          The PAAs are listed in the order of preference
                          for use by the client.


   A PaC (DHCPv4 client) SHOULD request the PAA DHCPv4 Option in a
   Parameter Request List, as described in [RFC2131] and [RFC2132].

   If configured with a (list of) PAA address(es), a DHCPv4 server
   SHOULD send a client the PAA DHCPv4 option, even if this option is
   not explicitly requested by the client.

   A PaC (DHCPv4 client) receiving the PAA DHCPv4 option SHOULD use the
   (list of) IP address(es) to locate PAA(s).

   The PaC (DHCPv4 client) MUST try the records in the order listed in
   the PAA DHCPv4 option received from the DHCPv4 server.

5.  PANA Authentication Agent DHCPv6 Option

   This DHCPv6 option carries a list of 128-bit (binary) IPv6 addresses
   indicating PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs) available to the PANA
   client (PaC).

   The DHCPv6 option for PANA Authentication Agent has the format shown
   in Figure 2.

      option-length:      Length of the 'options' field in octets;
                          MUST be a multiple of sixteen (16).

      PAA IPv6 Address:   IPv6 address of a PAA for the client to use.
                          The PAAs are listed in the order of preference
                          for use by the client.

   A PaC DHCPv6 client SHOULD request the PAA DHCPv6 option in an
   Options Request Option (ORO) as described in the DHCPv6 specification
   [RFC3315].

   If configured with a (list of) PAA address(es), a DHCPv6 server
   SHOULD send a client the PAA DHCPv6 option, even if this option is
   not explicitly requested by the client.

   A PaC (DHCPv6 client) receiving the PAA DHCPv6 option SHOULD use the
   (list of) IP address(es) to locate PAA(s).

   The PaC (DHCPv6 client) MUST try the records in the order listed in
   the PAA DHCPv6 option received from the DHCPv6 server.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The following DHCPv4 option code for PANA Authentication Agent
   options has been assigned by IANA:

      Option  Name           Value       Described in
      -----------------------------------------------
      OPTION_PANA_AGENT       136         Section 4

   The following DHCPv6 option code for PANA Authentication Agent
   options has been assigned by IANA:

      Option  Name            Value       Described in
      ------------------------------------------------
      OPTION_PANA_AGENT        40         Section 5

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC2131], [RFC2132], and [RFC3315]
   apply.  If an adversary manages to modify the response from a DHCP
   server or insert its own response, a PANA Client could be led to
   contact a rogue PANA Authentication Agent, possibly one that then
   intercepts authentication requests and/or denies network access to
   the access device.

   In most networks, the DHCP exchange that delivers the options prior
   to network access authentication is neither integrity protected nor
   origin authenticated.  Therefore, the options defined in this
   document MUST NOT be used to perform any negotiation on the use of
   PANA between the PANA Client and a PANA Authentication Agent.  Using
   the presence (or absence) of these DHCP options as an indication of
   network mandating PANA authentication (or not) is an example of such
   a negotiation mechanism.  This negotiation would allow bidding-down
   attacks by making the clients choose to use a lower-grade security
   mechanism (or even no security at all).
