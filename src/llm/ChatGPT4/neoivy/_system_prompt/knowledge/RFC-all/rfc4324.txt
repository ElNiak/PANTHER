Abstract

   The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) described in this memo permits a
   Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent (CUA) to access
   an iCAL-based Calendar Store (CS).  At the time of this writing,
   three vendors are implementing CAP, but it has already been
   determined that some changes are needed.  In order to get
   implementation experience, the participants felt that a CAP
   specification is needed to preserve many years of work.  Many
   properties in CAP which have had many years of debate, can be used by
   other iCalendar protocols.

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the Calendar Access Protocol (CAP).  CAP
   permits a Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent (CUA)
   to access an iCAL-based Calendar Store (CS) and manage calendar
   information.  In particular, the document specifies how to query,
   create, modify, and delete iCalendar components (e.g., events, to-
   dos, or daily journal entries).  It further specifies how to search
   for available busy time information.  Synchronization with CUAs is
   not covered, but it is believed to be possible using CAP.

   At the time of this writing, three vendors are implementing CAP.  It
   has already been determined that some changes are needed.  In order
   to get implementation experience, the participants felt that a CAP
   specification is needed to preserve many years of work.  Many
   properties in CAP can be used by other iCalendar protocols and have
   had many years of debate.

   CAP is specified as a BEEP (Block Extensible Exchange Protocol)
   "profile" [BEEP] [BEEPGUIDE].  Many aspects of the protocol (e.g.,
   authentication and privacy) are provided within BEEP.  The protocol
   data units of CAP leverage the standard iCalendar format iCAL [iCAL]
   to convey calendar-related information.

   CAP can also be used to store and fetch iCalendar Transport-
   Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP) objects [iTIP].  iTIP
   objects used are exactly as defined in [iTIP].  When iCalendar
   objects are transferred between the CUA and a CS, some additional
   properties and parameters may be added; the CUA is responsible for
   correctly generating iCalendar objects to non-CAP processes.

   The definition of new components, properties, parameters, and value
   types are broken into two parts.  The first part summarizes and
   defines the new objects.  The second part provides detail and ABNF
   for those objects.  The ABNF rules for CAP, as for other iCalendar
   specifications, are order-independent.  That is, properties in a
   component may occur in any order, and parameters in any property may
   occur in any order.

1.1.  Formatting Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Calendaring and scheduling roles are referred to in quoted-strings of
   text with the first character of each word in upper case.  For
   example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User" (CU)



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                      [Page 5]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   within the protocol defined by [iTIP].  Calendar components defined
   by [iCAL] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text.
   All iCalendar components should start with the letter "V".  For
   example, "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component, "VTODO"
   refers to the to-do component, and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily
   journal component.

   Scheduling methods defined by [iTIP] are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text.  For example, "REPLY" refers to
   the method for replying to a "REQUEST".

   CAP commands are referred to by upper-case, quoted-strings of text,
   followed by the word "command".  For example, '"CREATE" command'
   refers to the command for creating a calendar entry, '"SEARCH"
   command' refers to the command for reading calendar components.  CAP
   commands are named using the "CMD" property.

   Properties defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property".  For
   example, '"ATTENDEE" property' refers to the iCalendar property used
   to convey the calendar address that has been invited to a "VEVENT" or
   "VTODO" component.

   Property parameters defined by this memo are referred to with
   capitalized, quoted-strings of text, followed by the word
   "parameter".  For example, "PARTSTAT" parameter refers to the
   iCalendar property parameter used to specify the participation status
   of an attendee.  Enumerated values defined by this memo are referred
   to with capitalized text, either alone or followed by the word
   "value".

   Object states defined by this memo are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "state".  For example,
   '"BOOKED" state' refers to an object in the booked state.

   Within a query, the different parts are referred to as a "clause" and
   its value as "clause value" and the clause name will be in uppercase
   enclosed in quotes, for example, 'The "SELECT" claus' or 'if the
   "SELECT" clause value contains ...'.

   In tables, the quoted-string text is specified without quotes in
   order to minimize the table length.

1.2.  Related Documents

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this one, describe the Internet calendaring and scheduling
   standards.  These documents are as follows.



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                      [Page 6]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


      [iCAL] (RFC2445) specifies the objects, data types, properties and
         property parameters used in the protocols, along with the
         methods for representing and encoding them.

      [iTIP] (RFC2446) specifies an interoperability protocol for
         scheduling between different installations.

      [iMIP] (RFC2447) specifies the Internet email binding for [iTIP].

      [GUIDE] (RFC3283) is a guide to implementers and describes the
         elements of a calendaring system, how they interact with each
         other, how they interact with end users, and how the standards
         and protocols are used.

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts
   and definitions from these earlier memos.  Where possible, references
   are made to the memo that provides the specification of these
   concepts and definitions.

1.3  Definitions

   UNPROCESSED, BOOKED, DELETED -  A conceptual state of an object in
      the calendar store.  There are three conceptual states:
      "UNPROCESSED" state, "BOOKED" state, and marked for deletion,
      which is the "DELETED" state.  How the implementation stores the
      state of any object is not a protocol issue and is not discussed.
      An object can be said to be booked, unprocessed, or marked for
      deletion.

      1.  An "UNPROCESSED" state scheduling object has been stored in
          the calendar store but has not been acted on by a CU or CUA.
          All scheduled entries are [iTIP] objects.  No [iTIP] objects
          in the store are in the "BOOKED" state.  To retrieve any
          [iTIP] object, simply do a query asking for any objects that
          are stored in the "UNPROCESSED" state.

      2.  A "BOOKED" state entry is stored with the "CREATE" command.
          It is an object that has been acted on by a CU or CUA and
          there has been a decision to store an object.  To retrieve any
          booked object, simply do a query asking for any objects that
          were stored in the "BOOKED" state.

      3.  A "DELETED" state entry is created by sending a "DELETE"
          command with the "OPTION" parameter value set to "MARK".  To
          retrieve any deleted object, simply do a query asking for any
          objects that were stored in the "DELETED" state.  By default
          objects marked for delete are not returned.  The CUA must
          specifically ask for marked-for-deletion objects.  You cannot



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                      [Page 7]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


          ask for components in the "DELETED" state and in other states
          in the same "VQUERY" component, as there would be no way to
          distinguish between them in the reply.

   Calendar -  A collection of logically related objects or entities
      each of which may be associated with a calendar date and possibly
      time of day.  These entities can include calendar properties or
      components.  In addition, a calendar might be related to other
      calendars with the "RELATED-TO" property.  A calendar is
      identified by its unique calendar identifier.  The [iCAL] defines
      the initial calendar properties, calendar components and
      properties that make up the contents of a calendar.

   Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) -  The Internet protocol that permits
      a CUA to access and manipulate calendars residing on a Calendar
      Store.  (This memo.)

   Calendar Access Rights (VCAR) -  The mechanism for specifying the CAP
      operations ("PERMISSION") that a particular calendar user ("UPN",
      defined below) is granted or denied permission to perform on a
      given calendar object ("SCOPE").  The calendar access rights are
      specified with a "VCAR" component.  (Section 9.3)

   Calendar Address -  Also see Calendar URL, which is the same as a CAP
      address.  The calendar address can also be the value to the
      "ATTENDEE" and "ORGANIZER" properties, as defined in [iCAL].
      Calendar URL -  A calendar URL is a URL, defined in this memo,
      that specifies the address of a CS or Calendar.

   Component -  Any object that conforms to the iCalendar object format
      and that is either defined in an Internet Draft, registered with
      IANA, or is an experimental object that is prefixed with "x-".
      Some types of components include calendars, events, to-dos,
      journals, alarms, and time zones.  A component consists of
      properties and possibly other contained components.  For example,
      an event may contain an alarm component.

   Container -  This is a generic name for VCALSTORE or VAGENDA.

   Properties -  An attribute of a particular component.  Some
      properties are applicable to different types of components.  For
      example, the "DTSTART" property is applicable to the "VEVENT",
      "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" components.  Other components are
      applicable only to an individual type of calendar component.  For
      example, the "TZURL" property may only be applicable to the
      "VTIMEZONE" components.

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   Calendar Identifier (CALID) -  A globally unique identifier
      associated with a calendar.  Calendars reside within a CS.  See
      Qualified Calendar Identifier and Relative Calendar Identifier.
      All CALIDs start with "cap:".

   Calendar Policy -  A CAP operational restriction on the access or
      manipulation of a calendar.  These may be outside the scope of the
      CAP protocol.  An example of an implementation or site policy is,
      "events MUST be scheduled in unit intervals of one hour".

   Calendar Property -  An attribute of a calendar ("VAGENDA").  The
      attribute applies to the calendar, as a whole.  For example, the
      "CALSCALE" property specifies the calendar scale (e.g., the
      "GREGORIAN" value) for the all entries within the calendar.

   Calendar Store (CS) -  The data and service model definitions for a
      Calendar Store as defined in this memo.  This memo does not
      specify how the CS is implemented.

   Calendar Server -  An implementation of a Calendar Store (CS) that
      manages one or more calendars.

   Calendar Store Identifier (CSID) -  The globally unique identifier
      for an individual CS.  A CSID consists of the host and port
      portions of a "Common Internet Scheme Syntax" part of a URL, as
      defined by [URL].  The CSID excludes any reference to a specific
      calendar.  (Section 8.9)

   Calendar Store Components -  Components maintained in a CS specify a
      grouping of calendar store-wide information.

   Calendar Store Properties -  Properties maintained in a Calendar
      Store represent store-wide information.

   Calendar User (CU) -  An entity (often biological) that uses a
      calendaring system.

   Calendar User Agent (CUA) -  The client application that a CU
      utilizes to access and manipulate a calendar.

   CAP Session -  An open communication channel between a CUA and a CS.
      If the CAP session is authenticated, the CU is "authenticated" and
      it is an "authenticated CAP session".

   Contained Component / Contained Properties -  A component or property
      that is contained inside of another component.  For example, a
      "VALARM" component may be contained inside a "VEVENT" component,

      and a "TRIGGER" property could be a contained property of a
      "VALARM" component.

   Delegate -  A CU (sometimes called the delegatee) who has been
      assigned participation in a scheduled component (e.g., VEVENT) by
      one of the attendees in the scheduled component (sometimes called
      the delegator).  An example of a delegate is a team member told to
      go to a particular meeting in place of another invitee who is
      unable to attend.

   Designate -  A CU who is authorized to act on behalf of another CU.
      An example of a designate is an assistant.

   Experimental -  The CUA and CS may implement experimental extensions
      to the protocol.  They might also have experimental components,
      properties, and parameters.  These extensions MUST start with "x-"
      (or "X-") and should include a vendor prefix (such as "x-
      myvendor-").  There is no guarantee that these experimental
      extensions will interoperate with other implementations.  There is
      no guarantee that they will not interact in unpredictable ways
      with other vendor experimental extensions.  There is no guarantee
      that the same specific experimental extension is not used by
      multiple vendors in incompatible ways.  Implementations should
      limit sending those extensions to other implementations.

   Object -  A generic name for any component, property, parameter, or
      value type to be used in iCalendar.

   Overlapped Booking -  A policy that indicates whether or not
      components with a "TRANSP" property not set to "TRANSPARENT-
      NOCONFLICT" or "OPAQUE-NOCONFLICT" value can overlap one another.
      When the policy is applied to a calendar it indicates whether or
      not the time span of any component (VEVENT, VTODO, ...) in the
      calendar can overlap the time span of any other component in the
      same calendar.  When applied to an individual object, it indicates
      whether or not any other component's time span can overlap that
      individual component.  If the CS does not allow overlapped
      booking, then the CS is unwilling to allow any overlapped bookings
      within any calendar or entry in the CS.

   Owner -  One or more CUs or UGs that are listed in the "OWNER"
      property in a calendar.  There can be more than one owner.

   Qualified Calendar Identifier (Qualified CALID) -  A CALID in which
      both the scheme and CSID of the CAP URI are present.

   Realm -  A collection of calendar user accounts, identified by a
      string.  The name of the Realm is only used in UPNs.  In order to

      avoid namespace conflict, the Realm SHOULD be postfixed with an
      appropriate DNS domain name (e.g., the foobar Realm could be
      called foobar.example.com).

   Relative Calendar Identifier (Relative CALID) -  An identifier for an
      individual calendar in a calendar store.  It MUST be unique within
      a calendar store.  A Relative CALID consists of the "URL path" of
      the "Common Internet Scheme Syntax" portion of a URL, as defined
      by [URI] and [URLGUIDE].

   Session Identity -  A UPN associated with a CAP session.  A session
      gains an identity after successful authentication.  The identity
      is used in combination with VCAR to determine access to data in
      the CS.

   User Group (UG) -  A collection of Calendar Users and/or User Groups.
      These groups are expanded by the CS and may reside either locally
      or in an external database or directory.  The group membership may
      be fixed or dynamic over time.

   Username -  A name that denotes a Calendar User within a Realm.  This
      is part of a UPN.

   User Principal Name (UPN) -  A unique identifier that denotes a CU or
      a group of CUs.  (Section 6.1.2)

2.  Additions to iCalendar

   Several new components, properties, parameters, and value types are
   added in CAP.  This section summarizes those new objects.

   This memo extends the properties that can go into 'calprops' as
   defined in [iCAL] section 4.6 page 51, to allow [iTIP] objects
   transmitted between a CAP aware CUA and the CS to contain the
   "TARGET" and "CMD" properties.  This memo also adds to the [iCAL]
   ABNF to allow IANA and experimental extensions.  This memo does not
   address how a CUA transmits [iTIP] or [iMIP] objects to non-CAP
   programs.  What follows is ABNF, as described in [ABNF].

      calprops= 2*(

                    ; 'prodid' and 'version' are both REQUIRED,
                    ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                    ;
                prodid /version /
                    ;
                    ; These are optional, but MUST NOT occur
                    ; more than once.

      iana-prop   = ; Any property registered by IANA directly or
                    ; included in an RFC that may be applied to

      calscale    = ; As defined in [iCAL].
                    ;

   Another change is that the 'component' part of the 'icalbody' ABNF as
   described in [iCAL] section 4.6 is optional when sending a command,
   as shown in the following updated ABNF:

      icalbody = calprops component

                ; If the "VCALENDAR" component contains the "CMD"
                ; property then the 'component' is optional:
                ;
                / calprops     ; Which MUST include a "CMD" property
                ;
      component = ; As defined in [iCAL].

   In addition, a problem exists with the control of "VALARM" components
   and their "TRIGGER" properties.  A CU may wish to set its own alarms
   (local alarms) on components.  These local alarms are not to be
   forwarded to other CUs, CUAs, or CSs.  Similarly, the "SEQUENCE"
   property and the "ENABLE" parameter in local alarms are not to be
   forwarded to other CUs, CUAs, or CSs.  Therefore, for the protocol
   between a CUA and a CS, the following changes from [iCAL] section
   4.6.6 page 67 apply to the CAP protocol:

        alarmc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VALARM" CRLF



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 12]

                     (audioprop / dispprop / emailprop / procprop)

                     ;
       alarmseqparams = other-params [";" local-param] other-params
                     ;
                     ; Where DIGIT is defined in [iCAL]
                     ;
       posint0     = 1*DIGIT
       posint1     = posintfirst 1*DIGIT
                     ;
                     ; A number starting with 1 through 9.
                     ;
       posintfirst = %x31-39
                     ;
       other-params = *(";" xparam) *(";" iana-params)
                                    *(";" other-params)
                     ;
       iana-params = ; Any parameter registered by IANA directly or
                     ; included in an RFC that may be applied to
                     ; the property and within the rules published.
                     ;
       xparam        ; As defined in [iCAL].
                     ;

   The CUA adds a "SEQUENCE" property to each "VALARM" component as it
   books the component.  This property, along with the "LOCAL" and
   "ENABLE" parameters, allows the CUA to uniquely identify any VALARM
   in any component.  The CUA should remove those before forwarding to
   non-CAP-aware CUAs.

   In addition, if a CUA wished to ignore a "TRIGGER" property in a
   "VALARM" component that was supplied to it by the "Organizer", the
   CUA needs a common way to tag that trigger as disabled.  So the
   following is a modification to [iCAL] section 4.8.6.3 page 127:

      trigger    = "TRIGGER" 1*(";" enable-param) (trigrel / trigabs)



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 13]

      trigrel    = ; As defined in [iCAL].
                   ;
      trigabs    = ; As defined in [iCAL].

   See Section 7.2 and Section 7.5.

2.1.  New Value Types (Summary)

   UPN: The UPN value type is a text value type restricted to only UPN
      values (see Section 6.1.2).

   UPN-FILTER: Like the UPN value type, but also includes filter rules
      that allow wildcards (see Section 6.1.3).

   CALQUERY: The "CAL-QUERY" value type is a query syntax that is used
      by the CUA to specify the rules that apply to a CAP command (see
      Section 6.1.1).

2.1.1.  New Parameters (summary)

   ACTION -  The "ACTION" parameter informs the endpoint if it should
         abort or ask to continue on timeout.  (Section 7.1)

   ENABLE -  The "ENABLE" parameter in CAP is used to tag a property in
      a component as disabled or enabled.  (Section 7.2)

   ID -  The "ID" parameter specifies a unique identifier to be used for
      any outstanding commands.

   LATENCY -  The "LATENCY" parameter supplies the timeout value for
      command completion to the other endpoint.  (Section 7.4)

   LOCAL -  The "LOCAL" parameter in CAP is used to tag a property in a
      component to signify that the component is local or to be
      distributed.  (Section 7.5)

   LOCALIZE -  The "LOCALIZE" parameter specifies the locale to be used
      in error and warning messages.

   OPTIONS -  The "OPTIONS" parameter passes optional information for
      the command being sent.

2.1.2.  New or Updated Properties (summary)

   ALLOW-CONFLICT -  Some entries in a calendar might not be valid if
      other entries were allowed to overlap the same time span.
      (Section 8.1)

   ATT-COUNTER -  When storing a "METHOD" property with the "COUNTER"
      method, there needs to be a way to remember the "ATTENDEE" value
      that sent the COUNTER.  (Section 8.2)

   CAP-VERSION -  The version of CAP that the implementation supports.
      (Section 8.5)

   CAR-LEVEL -  The level of calendar access supported.  (Section 8.7)

   COMPONENTS -  The list of components supported.  (Section 8.8)

   CSID -  The Calendar Store IDentifier (CSID) uniquely identifies a
      CAP server.  (Section 8.9)

   CALID -  Each calendar within a CS needs to be uniquely identifiable.
      The "CALID" property identifies a unique calendar within a CS.  It
      can be a full CALID or a relative CALID.  (Section 8.3)

   CALMASTER -  The "CALMASTER" property specifies the contact
      information for the CS.  (Section 8.4)

   CARID -  Access rights can be saved and fetched by unique ID - the
      "CARID" property.  (Section 8.6)

   CMD -  The CAP commands, as well as replies are transmitted using the
      "CMD" property.  (Section 10.1)

   DECREED -  Some access rights are not changeable by the CUA.  When
      that is the case, the "DECREED" property value in the "VCAR"
      component will be "TRUE".  (Section 8.10)

   DEFAULT-CHARSET -  The list of charsets supported by the CS.  The
      first entry is the default for the CS.  (Section 8.11)

   DEFAULT-LOCALE -  The list of locales supported by the CS.  The first
      entry in the list is the default locale.  (Section 8.12)

   DEFAULT-TZID -  This is the list of known timezones supported.  The
      first entry is the default.  (Section 8.13)

   DEFAULT-VCARS -  A list of the "CARID" properties that will be used
      to create new calendars.  (Section 8.14)

   DENY -  The UPNs listed in the "DENY" property of a "VCAR" component
      will be denied access, as described in the "VRIGHT" component.
      (Section 8.15)

   EXPAND -  This property tells the CS if the query reply should expand
      components into multiple instances.  The default is "FALSE" and is
      ignored for CSs that cannot expand recurrence rules.  (Section
      8.16)

   GRANT -  The UPNs listed in the "GRANT" property of a "VCAR"
      component will be allowed access as described in the "VRIGHT"
      component.  (Section 8.17)

   MAXDATE -  The maximum date supported by the CS.  (Section 8.20)

   MAX-COMP-SIZE -  The largest component size allowed in the
      implementation including attachments in octets.  (Section 8.19)

   MINDATE -  The minimum date supported by the CS.  (Section 8.21)

   MULTIPART -  Passed in the capability messages to indicate which MIME
      multipart types the sender supports.  (Section 8.22)

   NAME -  The "NAME" property is used to add locale-specific
      descriptions into components.  (Section 8.23)

   OWNER -  Each calendar has at least one "OWNER" property.  (xref
      target="OWNER"/>) Related to the "CAL-OWNERS()" query clause.
      (Section 6.1.1.1)

   PERMISSION -  This property specifies the permission being granted or
      denied.  Examples are the "SEARCH" and "MODIFY" values.  (Section
      8.25)

   QUERY -  Used to hold the CAL-QUERY (Section 8.26) for the component.

   QUERYID -  A unique id for a stored query.  (Section 8.27)

   QUERY-LEVEL -  The level of the query language supported.  (Section
      8.28)

   RECUR-ACCEPTED -  If the implementation support recurrence rules.
      (Section 8.29)

   RECUR-EXPAND -  If the implementation support expanding recurrence
      rules.  (Section 8.31)

   RECUR-LIMIT -  Any maximum limit on the number of instances the
      implementation will expand recurring objects.  (Section 8.30)

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   REQUEST-STATUS -  The [iCAL] "REQUEST-STATUS" property is extended to
      include new error numbers.

   RESTRICTION -  In the final check when granting calendar access
      requests, the CS test the results of a command for the value of
      the "RESTRICTION" property in the corresponding "VRIGHT"
      component, to determine if the access meets that restriction.
      (Section 8.32)

   SCOPE -  The "SCOPE" property is used in "VRIGHT"s component to
      select the subset of data that may be acted upon when checking
      access rights.  (Section 8.33)

   SEQUENCE -  When the "SEQUENCE" property is used in a "VALARM"
      component, it uniquely identifies the instances of the "VALARM"
      within that component.

   STORES-EXPANDED -  Specifies if the implementation stores recurring
      objects expanded or not.  (Section 8.34)

   TARGET -  The new "VCALENDAR" component property "TARGET" (Section
      8.35) is used to specify which calendar(s) will be the subject of
      the CAP command.

   TRANSP -  This is a modification of the [iCAL] "TRANSP" property and
      it allows more values.  The new values are related to conflict
      control.  (Section 8.36)

2.1.3.  New Components (summary)

   VAGENDA -  CAP allows the fetching and storing of the entire contents
      of a calendar.  The "VCALENDAR" component is not sufficient to
      encapsulate all of the needed data that describes a calendar.  The
      "VAGENDA" component is the encapsulating object for an entire
      calendar.  (Section 9.1)

   VCALSTORE -  Each CS contains one or more calendars (VAGENDAs), the
      "VCALSTORE" component is the encapsulating object that can hold
      all of the "VAGENDA" components along with any components and
      properties that are unique to the store level.  (Section 9.2)

   VCAR -  Calendar Access Rights are specified and encapsulated in the
      new iCalendar "VCAR" component.  The "VCAR" component holds some
      new properties and at least one "VRIGHT" component.  (Section 9.3)

      VRIGHT -  This component encapsulates a set of instructions to the
      CS to define the rights or restrictions needed.  (Section 9.4)




Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 17]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   VREPLY -  This component encapsulates a set of data that can consist
      of an arbitrary number of properties and components.  Its contents
      are dependent on the command that was issued.  (Section 9.5)

   VQUERY -  The search operation makes use of a new component, called
      "VQUERY" and a new value type "CAL-QUERY" (Section 6.1.1).  The
      "VQUERY" component is used to fetch objects from the CS.  (Section
      9.6)

2.2.  Relationship of RFC-2446 (ITIP) to CAP

   [iTIP] describes scheduling methods that result in indirect
   manipulation of components.  In CAP, the "CREATE" command is used to
   deposit entities into the store.  Other CAP commands, such as
   "DELETE", "MODIFY", and "MOVE" command values, provide direct
   manipulation of components.  In the CAP calendar store model,
   scheduling messages are conceptually kept separate from other
   components by their state.

   All scheduling operations are as defined in [iTIP].  This memo makes
   no changes to any of the methods or procedures described in [iTIP].
   In this memo, referring to the presence of the "METHOD" property in
   an object is the same as saying an [iTIP] object.

   A CUA may create a "BOOKED" state object by depositing an iCalendar
   object into the store.  This is done by depositing an object that
   does not have a "METHOD" property.  The CS then knows to set the
   state of the object to the "BOOKED" state.  If the object has a
   "METHOD" property, then the object is stored in the "UNPROCESSED"
   state.

   If existing "UNPROCESSED" state objects exist in the CS for the same
   UID (UID is defined in [iCAL]), then a CUA may wish to consolidate
   the objects into one "BOOKED" state object.  The CUA would fetch the
   "UNPROCESSED" state objects for that UID and process them in the CUA
   as described in [iTIP].  Then, if the CUA wished to book the UID, the
   CUA would issue a "CREATE" command to create the new "BOOKED" state
   object in the CS, followed by a "DELETE" command to remove any
   related old [iTIP] objects from the CS.  It might also involve the
   CUA sending some [iMIP] objects or contacting other CSs and
   performing CAP operations on those CSs.

   The CUA could also decide not to book the object.  In this case, the
   "UNPROCESSED" state objects could be removed from the CS, or the CUA
   could set those objects to the marked-for-delete state.  The CUA
   could also ignore objects for later processing.





Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 18]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   The marked-for-delete state is used to keep the object around so that
   the CUA can process duplicate requests automatically.  If a duplicate
   [iTIP] object is deposited into the CS and there exists identical
   marked-for-delete objects, then a CUA acting on behalf of the "OWNER"
   can silently drop those duplicate entries.

   Another purpose for the marked-for-delete state is so that, when a CU
   decides they do not wish to have the object show in their calendar,
   the CUA can book the object by changing the "PARTSTAT" parameter to
   "DECLINED" in the "ATTENDEE" property that corresponds to their UPN.
   Then the CUA can perform [iTIP] processing such as sending back a
   decline, and then mark that object as marked-fo-delete.  The CUA
   might be configurable to automatically drop any updates for that
   object, knowing the CU has already declined.

   When synchronizing with multiple CUAs, the marked-for-delete state
   could be used to inform the synchronization process that an object is
   to be deleted.  How synchronization is done is not specified in this
   memo.

   Several "UNPROCESSED" state entries can be in the CS for the same
   UID.  However, once consolidated, only one object exists in the CS
   and that is the booked object.  The other objects MUST be removed or
   have their state changed to "DELETED".

   There MUST NOT be more than one "BOOKED" state object in a calendar
   for the same "UID".  The "ADD" method value may create multiple
   objects in the "BOOKED" state for the same UID; however, for the
   purpose of this memo, they are the same object and simply have
   multiple "VCALENDAR" components.

   For example, if you were on vacation, you could have received a
   "REQUEST" method to attend a meeting and several updates to that
   meeting.  Your CUA would have to issue "SEARCH" commands to find them
   in the CS using CAP, process them, and determine the final state of
   the object from a possible combination of user input and programmed
   logic.  Then the CUA would instruct the CS to create a new booked
   object from the consolidated results.  Finally, the CUA could do a
   "DELETE" command to remove the related "UNPROCESSED" state objects.
   See [iTIP] for details on resolving multiple [iTIP] scheduling
   entries.

3.  CAP Design

3.1.  System Model

   The system model describes the high level components of a calendar
   system and how they interact with each other.

   CAP is used by a CUA to send commands to, and receive responses from,
   a CS.

   The CUA prepares a [MIME] encapsulated message, sends it to the CS,
   and receives a [MIME] encapsulated response.  The calendaring-related
   information within these messages are represented by iCalendar
   objects.  In addition, the "GET-CAPABILITY" command can be sent from
   the CS to the CUA.

   There are two distinct protocols in operation to accomplish this
   exchange.  [BEEP] is the transport protocol used to move these
   encapsulations between a CUA and a CS.  CAP's [BEEP] profile defines
   the application protocol that specifies the content and semantics of
   the messages sent between the CUA and the CS.

3.2.  Calendar Store Object Model

   [iCAL] describes components such as events, todos, alarms, and
   timezones.  CAP requires additional object infrastructure, in
   particular, detailed definitions of the containers for events and
   todos (calendars), access control objects, and a query language.

   The conceptual model for a calendar store is shown below.  The
   calendar store (VCALSTORE - Section 9.2) contains "VCAR"s, "VQUERY"s,
   "VTIMEZONE"s, "VAGENDA"s and calendar store properties.

   Calendars (VAGENDAs) contain "VEVENT"s, "VTODO"s, "VJOURNAL"s,
   "VCAR"s, "VTIMEZONE"s, "VFREEBUSY", "VQUERY"s, and calendar
   properties.

   The component "VCALSTORE" is used to denote the root of the calendar
   store and contains all of the calendars.

   Calendars within a Calendar Store are identified by their unique
   Relative CALID.

3.3.  Protocol Model

   CAP uses [BEEP] as the transport and authentication protocol.

   The initial charset MUST be UTF-8 for a session in an unknown locale.
   If the CS supplied the [BEEP] 'localize' attribute in the [BEEP]
   'greeting', then the CUA may tell the CS to switch locales for the
   session by issuing the "SET-LOCALE" CAP command and supplying one of
   the locales supplied by the [BEEP] 'localize' attribute.  If a locale
   is supplied, the first locale in the [BEEP] 'localize' attribute is
   the default locale of the CS.  The locale is switched only after a
   successful reply.





Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 21]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   The "DEFAULT-CHARSET" property of the CS contains the list of
   charsets supported by the CS with the first value being the default
   for new calendars.  If the CUA wishes to switch to one of those
   charsets for the session, the CUA issues the "SET-LOCALE" command.
   The CUA would have to first perform a "GET-CAPABILITY" command on the
   CS to get the list of charsets supported by the CS.  The charset is
   switched only after a successful reply.

   The CUA may switch locales and charsets as needed.  There is no
   requirement that a CS support multiple locales or charsets.

3.3.1.  Use of BEEP, MIME, and iCalendar

   CAP uses the [BEEP] application protocol over TCP.  Refer to [BEEP]
   and [BEEPTCP] for more information.  The default port on which the CS
   listens for connections is user port 1026.

   The [BEEP] data exchanged in CAP is a iCalendar MIME content that
   fully conforms to [iCAL] iCalendar format.

   This example tells the CS to generate and return 10 UIDs to be used
   by the CUA.  Note that throughout this memo, 'C:' refers to what the
   CUA sends, 'S:' refers to what the CS sends, 'I:' refers to what the
   initiator sends, and 'L:' refers to what the listener sends.  Here
   initiator and listener are used as defined in [BEEP].

      C: MSG 1 2 . 432 62
      C: Content-Type: text/calendar
      C:
      C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      C: VERSION:2.0
      C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      C: CMD;ID=unique-per-cua-123;OPTIONS=10:GENERATE-UID
      C: END:VCALENDAR

   NOTE: The following examples will not include the [BEEP] header and
   footer information.  Only the iCalendar objects that are sent between
   the CUA and CS will be shown because the [BEEP] payload boundaries
   are independent of CAP.

   The commands listed below are used to manipulate or access the data
   on the calendar store:

   ABORT -  Sent to halt the processing of some of the commands.
      (Section 10.2)

   CONTINUE -  Sent to continue processing a command that has reached
      its specified timeout time.  (Section 10.3)

   CREATE -  Create a new object on the CS.  Initiated only by the CUA.
      (Section 10.4)

   SET-LOCALE -  Tell the CS to use any named locale and charset

      Can also be used to mark an object for deletion.  (Section 10.5)

   GENERATE-UID -  Generate one or more unique ids.  Initiated only by
      the CUA.  (Section 10.6)

   GET-CAPABILITY - Query the capabilities of the other end point of the
      session.  (Section 10.7)

      the CUA.  (Section 10.8)

   MODIFY -  Modify components.  Initiated by the CUA only.  (Section
      10.9)

   MOVE -  Move components to another container.  Initiated only by the
      CUA.  (Section 10.10)

   REPLY -  When replying to a command, the "CMD" value will be set to
      "REPLY" so that it will not be confused with a new command.
      (Section 10.11)

   SEARCH -  Search for components.  Initiated only by the CUA.
      (Section 10.12)

   TIMEOUT -  Sent when a specified amount of time has lapsed and a
      command has not finished.  (Section 10.14)

4.  Security Model

   BEEP transport performs all session authentication.

4.1.  Calendar User and UPNs

   A CU is an entity that can be authenticated.  It is represented in
   CAP as a UPN, which is a key part of access rights.  The UPN
   representation is independent of the authentication mechanism used
   during a particular CUA/CS interaction.  This is because UPNs are
   used within VCARs.  If the UPN were dependent on the authentication
   mechanism, a VCAR could not be consistently evaluated.  A CU may use
   one mechanism while using one CUA, but the same CU may use a




Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 23]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   different authentication mechanism when using a different CUA, or
   while connecting from a different location.

   The user may also have multiple UPNs for various purposes.

   Note that the immutability of the user's UPN may be achieved by using
   SASL's authorization identity feature.  The transmitted authorization
   identity may be different than the identity in the client's
   authentication credentials [SASL, section 3].  This also permits a CU
   to authenticate using their own credentials, yet request the access
   privileges of the identity for which they are proxying SASL.  Also,
   the form of authentication identity supplied by a service like TLS
   may not correspond to the UPNs used to express a server's access
   rights, requiring a server-specific mapping to be done.  The method
   by which a server determines a UPN, based on the authentication
   credentials supplied by a client, is implementation-specific.  See
   [BEEP] for authentication details; [BEEP] relies on SASL.

4.1.1.  UPNs and Certificates

   When using X.509 certificates for purposes of CAP authentication, the
   UPN should appear in the certificate.  Unfortunately, there is no
   single correct guideline for which field should contain the UPN.

   Quoted from RFC-2459, section 4.1.2.6 (Subject):

         If subject naming information is present only in the
         subjectAlt-Name extension (e.g., a key bound only to an email
         address or URI), then the subject name MUST be an empty
         sequence and the subjectAltName extension MUST be critical.

         Implementations of this specification MAY use these comparison
         rules to process unfamiliar attribute types (i.e., for name
         chaining).  This allows implementations to process certificates
         with unfamiliar attributes in the subject name.

         In addition, legacy implementations exist where an RFC 2822
         name [RFC2822] is embedded in the subject distinguished name as
         an EmailAddress attribute.  The attribute value for
         EmailAddress is of type IA5String to permit inclusion of the
         character '@', which is not part of the PrintableString
         character set.  EmailAddress attribute values are not case
         sensitive (e.g., "fanfeedback@redsox.example.com" is the same
         as "FANFEEDBACK@REDSOX.EXAMPLE.COM").

         Conforming implementations generating new certificates with
         electronic mail addresses MUST use the rfc822Name in the
         subject alternative name field (see sec. 4.2.1.7 of [X509CRL])



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 24]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


         to describe such identities.  Simultaneous inclusion of the
         EmailAddress attribute in the subject distinguished name to
         support legacy implementations is deprecated but permitted.

   Since no single method of including the UPN in the certificate will
   work in all cases, CAP implementations MUST support the ability to
   configure what the mapping will be by the CS administrator.
   Implementations MAY support multiple mapping definitions, for
   example, the UPN may be found in either the subject alternative name
   field, or the UPN may be embedded in the subject distinguished name
   as an EmailAddress attribute.

   Note: If a CS or CUA is validating data received via [iMIP], if the
   "ORGANIZER" or "ATTENDEE" properties said, for example,
   "ATTENDEE;CN=Joe Random User:MAILTO:juser@example.com", then the
   email address should be checked against the UPN.  This is so the
   "ATTENDEE" property cannot be changed to something misleading like
   "ATTENDEE;CN=Joe Rictus User:MAILTO:jrictus@example.com" and have it
   pass validation.  Note that it is the email addresses that
   miscompare, the CN miscompare is irrelevant.

4.1.2.  Anonymous Users and Authentication

   Anonymous access is often desirable.  For example, an organization
   may publish calendar information that does not require any access
   control for viewing or login.  Conversely, a user may wish to view
   unrestricted calendar information without revealing their identity.

4.1.3.  User Groups

   A User Group is used to represent a collection of CUs or other UGs
   that can be referenced in VCARs.  A UG is represented in CAP as a
   UPN.  The CUA cannot distinguish between a UPN that represents a CU
   or a UG.

   UGs are expanded as necessary by the CS.  The CS MAY expand a UG
   (including nested UGs) to obtain a list of unique CUs.  Duplicate
   UPNs are filtered during expansion.

   How the UG expansion is maintained across commands is
   implementation-specific.  A UG may reference a static list of
   members, or it may represent a dynamic list.  Operations SHOULD
   recognize changes to UG membership.

   CAP does not define commands or methods for managing UGs.

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


4.2.  Access Rights

   Access rights are used to grant or deny access to calendars,
   components, properties, and parameters in a CS to a CU.  CAP defines
   a new component type called a Calendar Access Right (VCAR).
   Specifically, a "VCAR" component grants, or denies, UPNs the right to
   search and write components, properties, and parameters on calendars
   within a CS.

   The "VCAR" component model does not put any restriction on the
   sequence in which the object and access rights are created.  That is,
   an object associated with a particular "VCAR" component might be
   created before or after the actual "VCAR" component is defined.  In
   addition, the "VCAR" and "VEVENT" components might be created in the
   same iCalendar object and passed together in a single object.

   All rights MUST be denied unless specifically granted.

   If two rights specified in "VCAR" components are in conflict, the
   right that denies access always takes precedence over the right that
   grants access.  Any attempt to create a "VCAR" component that
   conflicts with a "VCAR" components with a "DECREED" property set to
   the "TRUE" value must fail.

4.2.1.  Access Control and NOCONFLICT

   The "TRANSP" property can take on values -- "TRANSPARENT-NOCONFLICT"
   and "OPAQUE-NOCONFLICT" -- that prohibit other components from
   overlapping it.  This setting overrides access.  The "ALLOW-CONFLICT"
   CS, Calendar or component setting may also prevent overlap, returning
   an error code "6.3".

4.2.2.  Predefined VCARs

   The predefined calendar access CARIDs that MUST be implemented are:

      CARID:READBUSYTIMEINFO -  Specifies the "GRANT" and "DENY" rules
         that allow UPNs to search "VFREEBUSY" components.  An example
         definition for this VCAR is:

            BEGIN:VCAR
            CARID:READBUSYTIMEINFO
            BEGIN:VRIGHT
            GRANT:*
            PERMISSION:SEARCH
            SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VFREEBUSY WHERE STATE() = 'BOOKED'
            END:VRIGHT
            END:VCAR



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 26]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


      CARID:REQUESTONLY -  Specifies the "GRANT" and "DENY" rules to
         UPNs other than the owner of the calendar and specifies the
         ability to write new objects with the "METHOD" property set to
         the "REQUEST" value.  This CARID allows the owner to specify
         which UPNs are allowed to make scheduling requests.  An example
         definition for this VCAR is:

            BEGIN:VCAR
            CARID:REQUESTONLY
            BEGIN:VRIGHT
            GRANT:NON CAL-OWNERS()
            PERMISSION:CREATE
            RESTRICTION:SELECT VEVENT FROM VAGENDA
                WHERE METHOD = 'REQUEST'
            RESTRICTION:SELECT VTODO FROM VAGEND
                WHERE METHOD = 'REQUEST'
            RESTRICTION:SELECT VJOURNAL FROM VAGEND
                WHERE METHOD = 'REQUEST'
            END:VRIGHT
            END:VCAR

      CARID:UPDATEPARTSTATUS -  Grants authenticated users the right to
         modify the instances of the "ATTENDEE" property set to one of
         their calendar addresses in any components for any booked
         component containing an "ATTENDEE" property.  This allows (or
         denies) a CU the ability to update their own participation
         status in a calendar where they might not otherwise have
         "MODIFY" command access.  They are not allowed to change the
         "ATTENDEE" property value.  An example definition for this VCAR
         (only affecting the "VEVENT" components) is:

            BEGIN:VCAR
            CARID:UPDATEPARTSTATUS
            BEGIN:VRIGHT
            GRANT:*
            PERMISSION:MODIFY
            SCOPE:SELECT ATTENDEE FROM VEVENT
             WHERE ATTENDEE = SELF()
             AND ORGANIZER = CURRENT-TARGET()
             AND STATE() = 'BOOKED'
            RESTRICTION:SELECT * FROM VEVENT
             WHERE ATTENDEE = SELF()
            END:VRIGHT
            END:VCAR

      CARID:DEFAULTOWNER -  Grants to any owner the permission they have
         for the target.  An example definition for this VCAR is:




Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 27]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


            BEGIN:VCAR
            CARID:DEFAULTOWNER
            BEGIN:VRIGHT
            GRANT:CAL-OWNERS()
            PERMISSION:*
            SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VAGENDA
            END:VRIGHT
            END:VCAR

4.2.3.  Decreed VCARs

   A CS MAY choose to implement and allow persistent immutable VCARs
   that may be configured by the CS administrator.  A reply from the CS
   may dynamically create "VCAR" components that are decreed depending
   on the implementation.  To the CUA, any "VCAR" component with the
   "DECREED" property set to "TRUE" cannot be changed by the currently
   authenticated UPN, and, depending on the implementation and other
   "VCAR" components, might not be able to be changed by any UPN using
   CAP (never when the CUA gets a "DECREED:TRUE" VCAR).

   When a user attempts to modify or override a decreed "VCAR" component
   rules, an error will be returned indicating that the user has
   insufficient authorization to perform the operation.  The reply to
   the CUA MUST be the same as if a non-decreed VCAR caused the failure.

   The CAP protocol does not define the semantics used to initially
   create a decreed VCAR.  This administrative task is outside the scope
   of the CAP protocol.

   For example, an implementation or a CS administrator may wish to
   define a VCAR that will always allow the calendar owners to have full
   access to their own calendars.

   Decreed "VCAR" components MUST be readable by the calendar owner in
   standard "VCAR" component format.

4.3.  CAP Session Identity

   A [BEEP] session has an associated set of authentication credentials,
   from which is derived a UPN.  This UPN is the identity of the CAP
   session, and is used to determine access rights for the session.

   The CUA may change the identity of a CAP session by calling the
   "IDENTIFY" command.  The CS only permits the operation if the
   session's authentication credentials are good for the requested
   identity.  The method of checking this permission is implementation-
   dependent, but it may be thought of as a mapping from authentication
   credentials to UPNs.  The "IDENTIFY" command allows a single set of



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 28]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   authentication credentials to choose from multiple identities, and
   allows multiple sets of authentication credentials to assume the same
   identity.

   For anonymous access, the identity of the session is "@".  A UPN with
   a null Username and null Realm is anonymous.  A UPN with a null
   Username but non-null Realm (e.g.,"@example.com") may be used to mean
   any identity from that Realm.  This is useful to grant access rights
   to all users in a given Realm.  A UPN with a non-null Username and
   null Realm (e.g., "bob@") could be a security risk and MUST NOT be
   used.

   Because the UPN includes Realm information, it may be used to govern
   calendar store access rights across Realms.  However, governing
   access rights across Realms is only useful if login access is
   available.  This could be done through a trusted server relationship
   or a temporary account.  Note that trusted server relationships are
   outside the scope of CAP.

   The "IDENTIFY" command also provides for a weak group implementation.
   By allowing multiple sets of authentication credentials belonging to
   different users to identify as the same UPN, that UPN essentially
   identifies a group of people, and may be used for group calendar
   ownership, or the granting of access rights to a group.

5.  CAP URL and Calendar Address

   The CAP URL scheme is used to designate both calendar stores and
   calendars accessible using the CAP protocol.

   The CAP URL scheme conforms to the generic URL syntax defined in RFC
   2396 and follows the Guidelines for URL Schemes set forth in RFC
   2718.

   A CAP URL begins with the protocol prefix "cap" and is defined by the
   following grammar.

      capurl   = "cap://" csidpart [ "/" relcalid ]

   A 'relcalid' is an identifier that uniquely identifies a calendar on
   a particular calendar store.  There is no implied structure in a
   Relative CALID (relcalid).  It may refer to the calendar of a user or
   of a resource such as a conference room.  It MUST be unique within
   the calendar store.

   Here are some examples:

      cap://cal.example.com
      cap://cal.example.com/Company/Holidays
      cap://cal.example.com/abcd1234Usr

   A 'relcalid' is permitted and is resolved according to the rules
   defined in Section 5 of RFC 2396.

   Examples of valid relative CAP URLs:

      opqaueXzz123String
      UserName/Personal

   Calendar addresses can be described as qualified or relative CAP
   URLs.

   For a user currently authenticated to the CS on cal.example.com,
   these two example calendar addresses refer to the same calendar:

      cap://cal.example.com/abcd1234USR
      abcd1234USR

6.  New Value Types

   The following sections contains new components, properties,
   parameters, and value definitions.

   The purpose of these is to extend the iCalendar objects in a
   compatible way so that existing iCalendar "VERSION" property "2.0"
   value parsers can still parse the objects without modification.

6.1.  Property Value Data Types

6.1.1.  CAL-QUERY Value Type

   Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME value type CAL-QUERY

   Value Name: CAL-QUERY

   Value Type Purpose: This value type is used to identify values and
      contains query statements targeted at locating those values.  This
      is based on [SQL92] and [SQLCOM].

      1.  For the purpose of a query, all components should be handled
          as tables, and the properties of those components should be
          handled as columns.

      2.  All VAGENDAs and CSs look like tables for the purpose of a
          QUERY, and all of their properties look like columns in those
          tables.

      3.  You MUST NOT do any cross-component-type joins.  That means
          you can ONLY have one component OR one "VAGENDA" component OR
          one "VCALSTORE" component in the "FROM" clause.

      4.  Everything in the "SELECT" clause and "WHERE" clauses MUST be
          from the same component type or "VAGENDA" component OR
          "VCALSTORE" component in the "FROM" clause.

      5.  When multiple "QUERY" properties are supplied in a single
          "VQUERY" component, the results returned are the same as the
          results returned for multiple "VQUERY" components that each
          have a single "QUERY" property.

      6.  The '.' is used to separate the table name (component) and
          column name (property or component) when selecting a property
          that is contained inside a component that is targeted in the
          TARGET property.

      7.  A contained component without a '.' is not the same as
          "component-name.*".  If given as "component-name" (no dot),
          the encapsulating BEGIN/END statement will be supplied for
          "component-name".

   In the following example, '.' is used to separate the "TRIGGER"
   property from its contained component (VALARM), which is contained in
   any "VEVENT" component in the selected "TARGET" property value (a
   relcalid).  All "TRIGGER" properties in any "VEVENT" component in
   relcalid would be returned.

      TARGET:relcalid
      QUERY:SELECT VALARM.TRIGGER FROM VEVENT
      SELECT VALARM FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = "123"

   This returns one BEGIN/END "VALARM" component for each "VALARM"
   component in the matching "VEVENT" component.  As there is no '.'
   (dot) in the VALARM after the SELECT above, it returns:

      BEGIN:VALARM
      TRIGGER;RELATED=END:PT5M
      REPEAT:4
      ...
      END:VALARM
      BEGIN:VALARM
      TRIGGER;RELATED=START:PT5M
      DURATION:PT10M
      ...
      END:VALARM
      ...
      ...

  If the SELECT parameter is provided as "component-name.*", then only
  the properties and any contained components will be returned.  The
  example:

     SELECT VALARM.* FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = "123"

  will return all of the properties in each "VALARM" component in the
  matching "VEVENT" component:

      TRIGGER;RELATED=END:PT5M
      REPEAT:4
      ...
      TRIGGER;RELATED=START:PT5M
      DURATION:PT10M
      ...
      ...

  In the following SELECT clauses:

     (a) SELECT <a-property-name> FROM VEVENT

     (b) SELECT VALARM FROM VEVENT

     (c) SELECT VALARM.* FROM VEVENT

     (d) SELECT * FROM VEVENT

     (e) SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE
             VALARM.TRIGGER < '20020201T000000Z'
             AND VALARM.TRIGGER > '20020101T000000Z'

  Clause (a) elects all instances of <a-property-name> from all "VEVENT"
  components.

  Clauses (b) and (c) select all "VALARM" components from all "VEVENT"
  components. (b) would return them in BEGIN/END VALARM tags. (c) would
  return all of the properties without BEGIN/END VALARM tags.

  Clause (d) selects every property and every component that is in any
  "VEVENT" component, with each "VEVENT" component wrapped in a
  BEGIN/END VEVENT tags.

  Clause (e) selects all properties and all contained components in all
  "VEVENT" components that have a "VALARM" component with a "TRIGGER"
  property value between the provided dates and times, with each
  "VEVENT" component wrapped in BEGIN/END VEVENT tags.

   Here are two invalid SELECT clauses:

      (f) SELECT VEVENT.VALARM.TRIGGER FROM VEVENT

      (g) SELECT DTSTART,UID FROM VEVENT
            WHERE VTODO.SUMMERY = "Fix typo in CAP"

   Clause (f) is invalid because it contains two '.' characters.

   Clause (g) Is invalid because it mixes VEVENT
   and VTODO properties in the same VQUERY.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
   notation:

6.1.1.1.  [NOT] CAL-OWNERS()

   This function returns the list of "OWNER" properties for the named
   calendar when used in the "SELECT" clause.

   If called as 'CAL-OWNERS()', it is equivalent to the comma-separated
   list of all of the owners of the calendar that match the provided
   "TARGET" property value.  If the target is a "VCALSTORE", it returns
   the "CALMASTER" property.

   If called as 'CAL-OWNERS(cal-address)', then it is the equivalent to
   the comma-separated list of owners for the named calendar id.  If
   'cal-address' is a CS, it returns the "CALMASTER" property.

   If used in the "WHERE" clause, it returns true if the currently
   authenticated UPN is an owner of the currently selected object
   matched in the provided "TARGET" property.  Used in a CAL-QUERY
   "WHERE" clause and in the UPN-FILTER.

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


6.1.1.2.  CURRENT-TARGET()

   This is equivalent to the value of the "TARGET" property in the
   current command.  It is used in a CAL-QUERY "WHERE" clause.

6.1.1.3.  PARAM()

   This is used in a CAL-QUERY.  It returns or tests for the value of
   the named parameter from the named property.

6.1.1.3.1.  PARAM() in SELECT

   When used in a "SELECT" clause, it returns the entire property and
   all of that property's parameters; the result is not limited to the
   supplied parameter.  If the property does not contain the named
   parameter, then the property is not returned.  However, it could be
   returned as a result of another "SELECT" clause value.  If multiple
   properties of the supplied name have the named parameter, all
   properties with that named parameter are returned.  If multiple
   PARAM() clauses in a single "SELECT" CLAUSE match the same property,
   then the single matching property is returned only once.

   Also, note that many parameters have default values defined in [iCAL]
   that must be treated as existing with their default value in the
   properties, as defined in [iCAL], even when not explicitly present.
   For example, if a query were performed with PARAM(ATTENDEE,ROLE) then
   ALL "ATTENDEE" properties would match because, even when they do not
   explicitly contain the "ROLE" parameter, it has a default value and
   therefore must match.

   Therefore, when PARAM() is used in a "SELECT" clause, it is more
   accurate to say that it means return the property, if it contains the
   named parameter explicitly in the property or simply because the
   parameter has a default for that property.

6.1.1.3.2.  PARAM() in WHERE

   When PARAM() is used in the "WHERE" clause, a match is true when the
   parameter value matches the compare clause (according to the supplied
   WHERE values).  If multiple named properties contain the named
   parameter, then each parameter value is compared in turn to the
   condition; if any match, the results would be true for that condition
   the same as if only one had existed.  Each matching property or
   component is returned only once.

   Because a parameter may be multi-valued, the comparison might need to
   be done with an "IN" or "NOT IN" comparator.

   Given the following query:

      ATTENDEE;PARTSTAT=ACCEPTED:cap://host.com/joe

      SELECT VEVENT FROM VAGENDA
       WHERE PARAM(ATTENDEE,PARTSTAT) = 'ACCEPTED'

   Thus, all "VEVENT" components that contain one or more "ATTENDEE"
   properties that have a "PARTSTAT" parameter with a "ACCEPTED" value
   would be returned.  Also, each uniquely matching VEVENT would be
   returned only once, no matter how many "ATTENDEE" properties had
   matching roles, in each unique "VEVENT" component.

   Also note that many parameters have default values defined in [iCAL].
   Therefore, if the following query were performed on the "ATTENDEE"
   property in the above example:

      SELECT VEVENT FROM VAGENDA
       WHERE PARAM(ATTENDEE,ROLE) = 'REQ-PARTICIPANT'

   It would return the "ATTENDEE" property shown above because the
   default value for the "ROLE" parameter is "REQ-PARTICIPANT".

6.1.1.4.  SELF()

   Used in a CAL-QUERY "WHERE" clause.  Returns the UPN of the currently
   authenticated UPN or their current UPN as a result of an IDENTIFY
   command.

6.1.1.5.  STATE()

   Returns one of three values, "BOOKED", "UNPROCESSED", or "DELETED"
   depending on the state of the object.  "DELETED" is a component in
   the marked-for-delete state.  Components that have been removed from
   the store are never returned.

   If not specified in a query then both "BOOKED" and "UNPROCESSED" data
   is returned.  Each unique "METHOD" property must be in a separate
   MIME object, per the [iCAL] section 3.2 restriction.

6.1.1.6.  Use of Single Quote

   All literal values are surrounded by single quotes ('), not double
   quotes ("), and not without any quotes.  If the value contains quotes
   or any other ESCAPED-CHAR, they MUST be backslash-escaped as
   described in section 4.3.11 "Text" of [iCAL].  Any "LIKE" clause
   wildcard characters that are part of any literal data that is
   preceded by a "LIKE" clause or "NOT LIKE" clause and is not intended

   to mean wildcard search MUST be escaped as described in note (7)
   below.

6.1.1.7.  Comparing DATE and DATE-TIME Values

   When comparing "DATE-TIME" values to "DATE" values and when comparing
   "DATE" values to "DATE-TIME" values, the result will be true if the
   "DATE" value is on the same day as the "DATE-TIME" value.  They are
   compared in UTC no matter what time zone the data may have been
   stored in.

   Local time event, as described in section 4.2.19 of [iCAL], must be

   CUA in the "CAPABILITY" exchange.

   When "DATE" values and "DATE-TIME" values are compared with the
   "LIKE" clause, the comparison will be done as if the value is a
   [iCAL] DATE or DATE-TIME string value.

      LIKE '2002%' will match anything in the year 2002.

      LIKE '200201%' will match anything in January 2002.

      LIKE '%T000000' will match anything at midnight.

      LIKE '____01__T%' will match anything for any year or
                    time that is in January.
                    (Four '_', '01', two '_' 'T%').

   Using a "LIKE" clause value of "%00%", would return any value that
   contained two consecutive zeros.

   All comparisons will be done in UTC.

6.1.1.8.  DTEND and DURATION

   The "DTEND" property value is not included in the time occupied by
   the component.  That is, a "DTEND" property value of 20030614T12000
   includes all of the time up to, but not including, noon on that day.

   The "DURATION" property value end time is also not inclusive.  So an
   object with a "DTSTART" property value of 20030514T110000 and a
   "DURATION" property value of "1H" does not include noon on that day.

   When a "QUERY" property value contains a "DTEND" value, then the CS
   MUST also evaluate any existing "DURATION" property value and
   determine if it has an effective end time that matches the "QUERY"
   property supplied "DTEND" value or any range of values supplied by
   the "QUERY" property.

   When a "QUERY" property contains a "DURATION" value, then the CS MUST
   also evaluate any existing "DTEND" property values and determine if
   they have an effective duration that matches the value, or any range
   of values, supplied by the "QUERY" property.

6.1.1.9.  [NOT] LIKE

   The pattern matching characters are the '%' that matches zero or more
   characters, and '_' that matches exactly one character (where
   character does not always mean octet).

   "LIKE" clause pattern matches always cover the entire string.  To
   match a pattern anywhere within a string, the pattern must start and
   end with a percent sign.

   To match a '%' or '_' in the data and not have it interpreted as a
   wildcard character, they MUST be backslash-escaped.  Thus, to search
   for a '%' or '_' in the string:

      LIKE '%\%%'    Matches any string with a '%' in it.
      LIKE '%\_%'    Matches any string with a '_' in it.

   Strings compared using the "LIKE" clause MUST be performed using case
   insensitive comparisoison assumes 'a' = 'A').

   If the "LIKE" clause is preceded by 'NOT' then there is a match when
   the string compare fails.

   Some property values (such as the 'recur' value type), contain commas
   and are not multi-valued.  The CS must understand the objects being
   compared and understand how to determine how any multi-valued or
   multi-instances properties or parameter values are separated, quoted,



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 40]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   and backslash-escaped.  THE CS must perform the comparisons as if
   each value existed by itself and was not quoted or backslash-escaped,
   when comparing using the LIKE element.

   See related examples in Section 6.1.1.11.

6.1.1.10.  Empty vs. NULL

   When used in a CAL-QUERY value, "NULL" means that the property or
   parameter is not present in the object.  Paramaters that are not
   provided and have a default value in the property are considered to
   exist with their default value and will not be "NULL".

      If the property exists but has no value, then "NULL" MUST NOT
      match.

      If the parameter exists but has no value, then "NULL" MUST NOT
      match.

      If the parameter not present and has a default value, then "NULL"
      MUST NOT match.

      If the property (or parameter) exists but has no value, then it
      matches the empty string '' (quote quote).

6.1.1.11.  [NOT] IN

   This is similar to the "LIKE" clause, except it does value matching
   and not string comparison matches.

   Some iCalendar objects can be multi-instance and multi-valued.  The
   "IN" clause will return a match if the literal value supplied as part
   of the "IN" clause is contained in the value of any instance of the
   named property or parameter, or is in any of the multiple values in
   the named property or parameter.  Unlike the "LIKE" clause, the '%'
   and '_' matching characters are not used with the "IN" clause and
   have no special meaning.

   In this example:

      'value1' IN property          would match (a) only.
      'value1,value2' IN property   would match (b) only.
      'value%'  IN property         would NOT match any.
      ',' IN property               would NOT match any.
      '%,%' IN property             would NOT match any.
      'x' IN property               would match (f) and (c).
      '2' IN parameter              would match (c) only.
      '1,2' IN parameter            would match (d) only.
      ',' IN parameter              would match (e) only.
      '%,%' IN parameter            would NOT match any.

      property  LIKE 'value1%'      would match (a) and (b).
      property  LIKE 'value%'       would match (a) and (b).
      property  LIKE 'x'            would match (f) and (c).
      parameter LIKE '1%'           would match (c) and (d).
      parameter LIKE '%2%'          would match (c) and (d).
      parameter LIKE ','            would match (e) only.

   Some property values (such as the "RECUR" value type), contain commas
   and are not multi-valued.  The CS must understand the objects being
   compared and understand how to determine how any multi-valued or
   multi-instance properties or parameter values are separated, quoted,
   and backslash-escaped and perform the comparisons as if each value
   existed by itself and not quoted or backslash-escaped when comparing
   using the IN element.

   If the "IN" clause is preceded by 'NOT', then there is a match when
   the value does not exist in the property or parameter value.

6.1.1.12.  DATE-TIME and TIME Values in a WHERE Clause

   All "DATE-TIME" and "TIME" literal values supplied in a "WHERE"
   clause MUST be terminated with 'Z'.  That means that the CUA MUST
   supply the values in UTC.

   Valid:

      WHERE alarm.TRIGGER < '20020201T000000Z'
      AND alarm.TRIGGER > '20020101T000000Z'

   Not valid; it is a syntax error and the CS MUST reject the QUERY:

      WHERE alarm.TRIGGER < '20020201T000000'
      AND alarm.TRIGGER > '20020101T000000'

6.1.1.13.  Multiple Contained Components

   If a query references a component and a component or property
   contained in the component, any clauses referring to the contained
   component or property must be evaluated on all of the contained
   components or properties.  If any of the contained components or
   properties match the query, and the conditions on the containing
   component are also true, the component matches the query.

   For example, in the query below, if a BOOKED VEVENT contains multiple
   VALARMs, and the VALARM.TRIGGER clause is true for any of the VALARMs
   in the VEVENT, then the UID, SUMMARY, and DESCRIPTION of this VEVENT
   would be included in the QUERY results.

      BEGIN:VQUERY
      EXPAND:TRUE
      QUERY:SELECT UID,SUMMARY,DESCRIPTION FROM VEVENT
      WHERE VALARM.TRIGGER >= '20000101T030405Z'
      AND VALARM.TRIGGER <= '20001231T235959Z'
      AND STATE() = 'BOOKED'
      END:VQUERY

6.1.1.14.  Example, Query by UID

   The following example would match the entire content of a "VEVENT" or
   "VTODO" component with the "UID" property equal to "uid123" , and it
   would not expand any multiple instances of the component.  If the CUA
   does not know  if "uid123" was a "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL", or
   any other component, then all components that the CUA supports MUST
   be supplied in a QUERY property.  This example assumes the CUA is
   only interested in "VTODO" and "VEVENT" components.

   If the results were empty it could also mean that "uid123" was a
   property in a component other than a VTODO or VEVENT.

      BEGIN:VQUERY
      QUERY:SELECT * FROM VTODO WHERE UID = 'uid123'
      QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = 'uid123'
      END:VQUERY

6.1.1.15.  Query by Date-Time Range

      This query selects the entire content of every booked "VEVENT"
      component that has an instance greater than or equal to July 1,
      2000 00:00:00 UTC and less than or equal to July 30, 2000 23:59:59
      UTC.  This includes single instance "VEVENT" components that do
      not explicitly contain any recurrence properties or "RECURRENCE-
      ID" properties.  This works only for CSs that have the "RECUR-

      EXPAND" property value set to "TRUE" in the "GET-CAPABILITY"
      exchange.

      BEGIN:VQUERY
      EXPAND:TRUE
      QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT
      WHERE RECURRENCE-ID >= '20000701T000000Z'
      AND RECURRENCE-ID <= '20000730T235959Z'
      AND STATE() = 'BOOKED'
      END:VQUERY

6.1.1.16.  Query for All Unprocessed Entries

   The following example selects the entire contents of all non-booked
   "VTODO" and "VEVENT" components in the "UNPROCESSED" state.  The
   default for the "EXPAND" property is "FALSE", so the recurrence rules
   will not be expanded.

      BEGIN:VQUERY
      QUERYID:Fetch VEVENT and VTODO iTIP components
      QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE STATE() = 'UNPROCESSED'
      QUERY:SELECT * FROM VTODO WHERE STATE() = 'UNPROCESSED'
      END:VQUERY

   The following example fetches all "VEVENT" and "VTODO" components in
   the "BOOKED" state.

      BEGIN:VQUERY
      QUERYID:Fetch All Booked VEVENT and VTODO components
      QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE STATE() = 'BOOKED'
      QUERY:SELECT * FROM VTODO WHERE STATE() = 'BOOKED'
      END:VQUERY

   The following fetches the "UID" property for all "VEVENT" and "VTODO"
   components that have been marked for delete.

      BEGIN:VQUERY
      QUERYID:Fetch UIDs of marked-for-delete VEVENTs and VTODOs
      QUERY:SELECT UID FROM VEVENT WHERE STATE() = 'DELETED'
      QUERY:SELECT UID FROM VTODO WHERE STATE() = 'DELETED'
      END:VQUERY

6.1.1.17.  Query with Subset of Properties by Date/Time

   In this example, only the named properties will be selected, and all
   booked and non-booked components have a "DTSTART" value from February
   1st to February 10th 2000 (in UTC) will also be selected.

      END:VQUERY

6.1.1.18.  Query with Components and Alarms in A Range

   This example fetches all booked "VEVENT" components with an alarm
   that triggers within the specified time range.  In this case only the
   "UID", "SUMMARY", and "DESCRIPTION" properties will be selected for
   all booked "VEVENTS" components that have an alarm between the two
   date-times supplied.

      BEGIN:VQUERY
      EXPAND:TRUE
      QUERY:SELECT UID,SUMMARY,DESCRIPTION FROM VEVENT

6.1.2.  UPN Value Type

   Value Name: UPN

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain user
      principal name of a CU or a group of CUs.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
      notation:

                   ;
         upn        = "@"
                 / [ dot-atom-text ] "@" dot-atom-text
                   ;
                   ; dot-atom-text is defined in RFC 2822 [RFC2822]
                   ;
                   ;
         dot-atom-text = ; As defined in [iCAL].

   Description: This data type is an identifier that denotes a CU or a
      group of CU.  A UPN is an RFC 2822-compliant email address
      [RFC2822], with exceptions listed below, and in most cases it is
      deliverable to the CU.  In some cases it is identical to the CU's
      well known email address.  A CU's UPN MUST never be an e-mail
      address that is deliverable to a different person.  And there is
      no requirement that a person's UPN MUST be their e-mail address.



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 45]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


      A UPN is formatted as a user name followed by "@", followed by a
      Realm in the form of a valid and unique DNS domain name.  The user
      name MUST be unique within the Realm.  In its simplest form it
      looks like "user@example.com".

      In certain cases a UPN will not be RFC 2822-compliant.  When
      anonymous authentication is used, or anonymous authorization is
      being defined, the special UPN "@" will be used.  When
      authentication MUST be used, but unique identity MUST be obscured,
      a UPN of the form @DNS-domain-name may be used.  For example,
      "@example.com".

   Example:

      The following is a UPN for a CU:

         jdoe@example.com

      The following is an example of a UPN that could be for a group of
      CU:

         staff@example.com

      The following is a UPN for an anonymous CU that belongs to a
      specific realm.  When used as a UPN-FILTER, it applies to all UPNs
      in a specific realm:

         @example.com

      The following is a UPN for an anonymous CU:

6.1.3.  UPN-FILTER Value

   Value Name: UPN-FILTER

   Purpose: This value type is used to identify values that contain a
      user principal name filter.

   Formal Definition: The value type is defined by the following
      notation:

                      ;
                      ; NOTE: "CAL-OWNERS(cal-address)"

                      ;
                      ; dot-atom-text is defined in RFC 2822

   Description: The value is used to match user principal names (UPNs).
   For "CAL-OWNERS()" and "NOT CAL-OWNERS()", see Section 8.24.

      *           Matches all UPNs.

      @           Matches the UPN of anonymous CUs
                  belonging to the null realm

      @*          Matches the UPN of anonymous CUs
                  belonging to any non-null realm

      @realm      Matches the UPN of anonymous CUs
                  belonging to the specified realm.

      *@*         Matches the UPN of non-anonymous CUs
                  belonging to any non-null realm

      *@realm     Matches the UPN of non-anonymous CUs
                  belonging to the specified realm

7.  New Parameters

7.1.  ACTION Parameter

   Parameter Name: ACTION

   Purpose: This parameter indicates the action to be taken when a
      timeout occurs.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Conformance: This property can be specified in the "CMD" property.

      When present in a "CMD" property, the "ACTION" parameter specifies
      the action to be taken when the command timeout expires.

   Formal Definition: The parameter is defined by the following
      notation:

         action-param     = ";" "ACTION" "=" ( "ASK" / "ABORT" )
                             ; If 'action-param' is supplied then
                             ; 'latency-param' MUST be supplied.

   Example:

         CMD;LATENCY=10;ACTION=ASK:CREATE

7.2.  ENABLE Parameter

   Parameter Name: ENABLE

   Purpose: This parameter indicates whether or not the property should
      be ignored.  For example, it can indicate that a "TRIGGER"
      property in a "VALARM" component should be ignored.

   Value Type: BOOLEAN

   Conformance: This property can be specified in the "TRIGGER"
      properties.

   Description: When a non owner sends an [iTIP] "REQUEST" to a calendar
      that object might contain a "VALARM" component.  The owner may
      wish to have local control over their own CUA and when or how
      alarms are triggered.

      A CUA may add the "ENABLE" parameter to any "TRIGGER" property
      before booking the component.  If the "ENABLE" parameter is set to
      "FALSE", then the alarm will be ignored by the CUA.  If set to

      "TRUE", or if the "ENABLE" property is not in the "TRIGGER"
      property, the alarm is enabled.  This parameter may not be known
      by pre-CAP implementations, but this should not be an issue as it
      conforms to an 'ianaparam' [iCAL].

   Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

         enable-param       = "ENABLE" "=" boolean
                              ;
         boolean            = ; As defined in [iCAL].

   Example: The following is an example of this property for a "VAGENDA"
      component:

         TRIGGER;ENABLE=FALSE;RELATED=END:PT5M

7.3.  ID Parameter

   Parameter Name: ID

   Purpose: When used in a "CMD" component, it provides a unique
      identifier.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Conformance: This parameter can be specified in the "CMD" property.

   Description: If more than one command is sent, then the "ID"
      parameter is used to uniquely identify the command.

      A CUA may add the "ID" parameter to any "CMD" property before
      sending the command.  There must not be more than one outstanding
      command tagged with the same "ID" parameter value.

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance: The property can be specified in a "VCALSTORE"
      component.

   Description: The identifier MUST be globally unique.  Each CS needs
      its own unique identifier.  The "CSID" property is the official
      unique identifier for the CS.  If the BEEP 'serverName' attribute
      was supplied in the BEEP 'start' message, then the CSID will be
      mapped to the virtual host name supplied, and the host name part
      of the CSID MUST be the same as the 'serverName' value.  This
      allows one CS implementation to service multiple virtual hosts.
      CS's are not required to support virtual hosting.  If a CS does
      not support virtual hosting, then it must ignore the BEEP
      'serverName' attribute.

   Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

         csid = "CSID" other-params ":" capurl CRLF

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property MAY be specified once in a "VCAR"
      component.

   Description: This property is used in the "VCAR" component to specify
      whether the component is decreed or not.  If the "DECREED"
      property value is "TRUE" then the CUA will be unable to change the
      contents of the "VCAR" component and any attempt will fail with an
      error.

   Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

         decreed      = "DECREED" other-params ":" boolean CRLF

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in "VAGENDA" and
      "VCALSTORE" calendar component.

   Description: In a "VAGENDA" component this property is used to
      indicate the charset of calendar.  If not specified, the default
      is the first value in the "VCALSTORE" components "DEFAULT-CHARSET"
      property value list.  The value MUST be an IANA registered
      character set as defined in [CHARREG].

   In a "VCALSTORE" component it is a comma-separated list of charsets
      supported by the CS.  The first entry is the default entry for all
      newly created "VAGENDA" components.  The "UTF-8" value MUST be in
      the "VCALSTORE" component "DEFAULT-CHARSET" property list.  All
      compliant

      CAP implementations (CS and CUA) MUST support at least the "UTF-8"
      charset.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in "VAGENDA" and
      "VCALSTORE" components.

   Description: In a "VAGENDA" component, the "DEFAULT-LOCALE" property
      is used to indicate the locale of the calendar.  The full locale
      SHOULD be used.  The default and minimum locale is POSIX (aka the
      'C' locale).

      In a "VCALSTORE" component, it is a comma-separated list of
      locales supported by the CS.  The first value in the list is the
      default for all newly created VAGENDAs.  "POSIX" MUST be in the
      list.

   Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following notation:

         default-locale     = "DEFAULT-LOCALE" other-params ":" language
                               *( "," language) CRLF

      If used in a "VCALSTORE" component, it is a comma-separated list
      of TZIDs known to the CS.  The entry is used as the default TZID
      list for all newly created calendars.  The list MUST contain at
      least "UTC".  A "VCALSTORE" components MUST contain one
      "VTIMEZONE" component for each value in the "DEFAULT-TZID"
      property value.

      If used in a "VAGENDA" component, it is a comma-separated list of
      "TZID" property values naming the time zones known to the
      calendar.  The first time zone in the list is the default and is
      used as the localtime for objects that contain a date or date-time
      value without a time zone.  All "VAGENDA" components MUST have one
      "VTIMEZONE" component contained for each value in the "DEFAULT-
      TZID" property value.

      If a "TZID" property value contains a comma (,), the comma must be
      backslash-escaped.

   Formal Definition: This property is defined by the following
      notation:

   Purpose: This property defines the container that the issued command
      will act upon.  Its value is a capurl, as defined in Section 5.

   Value Type: URI

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a command component.

   Description: This property value is used to specify the container
      that the command will effect.  When used in a command, the command
      will be performed on the container that has a capurl matching the
      value.

   Formal Definition: The property is specified by the following
      notation:

         target   = "TARGET" other-params ":" ( capurl / relcalid ) CRLF

   Example: The following is an example of this property:

         TARGET:cap://mycal.example.com
         TARGET:SomeRelCalid

8.36.  TRANSP Property

   Property Name: TRANSP

   Purpose: This property defines whether a component is transparent or
      not to busy-time searches.  This is a modification to [iCAL]
      "TRANSP" property, in that it adds some values.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard property parameters can be
      specified on this property.

   Conformance: This property can be specified in a component.

   Description: Time Transparency is the characteristic of an object
      that determines whether it appears to consume time on a calendar.
      Objects that consume actual time for the individual or resource
      associated with the calendar SHOULD be recorded as "OPAQUE",
      allowing them to be detected by free-busy time searches.  Other
      objects, which do not take up the individual's (or resource's)
      time SHOULD be recorded as "TRANSPARENT", making them invisible to
      free/busy time searches.

                   / "OPAQUE-NOCONFLICT"
                           ; Opaque on busy time searches, and
                           ; no other OPAQUE or OPAQUE-NOCONFLICT
                           ; objects can overlap it.
                           ;
                           ; Default value is OPAQUE

      The following is an example of this property for an object that is
      opaque or blocks on free/busy time searches, and no other object
      can overlap it:

9.  New Components

9.1.  VAGENDA Component

   Component Name: VAGENDA

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of properties that defines an agenda.

   Formal Definition: There are two formats of the "VAGENDA" component.
      (1) When it is being created, and (2) how it exists in the
      "VCALSTORE" component.

      A "VAGENDA" component in a "VCALSTORE" component is defined by the
      following notes and ABNF notation:

         CALSCALE -  The value MUST be from the "VCALSTORE" "CALSCALE"
            property list.  The default is the first entry in the
            VCALSTORE CALSCALE list.

         CREATED -  The timestamp of the calendar's create date.  This

            is a READ ONLY property in a "VAGENDA".

         LAST-MODIFIED - The timestamp of any change to the "VAGENDA"
            properties or when any component was last created, modified,
            or deleted.

      agenda      = "BEGIN" ":" "VAGENDA" CRLF

      created    = ; As defined in [iCAL].
                   ;
      related-to = ; As defined in [iCAL].

   When creating a VAGENDA, use the following notation:

      agendac     = "BEGIN" ":" "VAGENDA" CRLF
                    agendacprop
                    *(icalobject)     ; as defined in [iCAL].

                    )

   To fetch all of the properties from the targeted "VAGENDA" component
   but do not fetch any components, use:

      SELECT * FROM VAGENDA

   To fetch all of the properties from the targeted VAGENDA and all of
   the contained components, use the special '*.*' value:

      SELECT *.* FROM VAGENDA

9.2.  VCALSTORE Component

   Component Name: VCALSTORE

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of properties that defines a calendar
      store.

   Formal Definition: A "VCALSTORE" component is defined by the
      following table and ABNF notation.  The creation of a "VCALSTORE"
      component is an administrative task and not part of the CAP
      protocol.

      The following are notes to some of the properties in the
      "VCALSTORE" component.

         CALSCALE -  A comma-separated list of CALSCALEs supported by
            this CS.  All "VAGENDA" component calendar CALSCALE
            properties MUST be from this list.  This list MUST contain
            at least "GREGORIAN".  The default for newly created
            "VAGENDA" components is the first entry.

         RELATED-TO -  This is a multiple-instance property.  There MUST
            be a "RELATED-TO" property for each of the "VAGENDA"
            components contained in the "VCALSTORE" component, each with
            the "RELTYPE" parameter value set to "CHILD".  Other
            "RELATED-TO" properties may be included.

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


         CREATED -  The timestamp of the CS creation time.  This is a
            READ ONLY property.

         CSID -  The CSID of this calendar store.  This MUST NOT be
            empty.  How this property is set in the VCALSTORE is an
            administrative or implementation-specific issue and is not
            covered in CAP.  This is a READ ONLY property.  A suggested
            value is the fully-qualified host name or a fully-qualified
            virtual host name supported by the system.

         LAST-MODIFIED -  The timestamp when the Properties of the
            "VCALSTORE" component were last updated or calendars were
            created or deleted.  This is a READ ONLY PROPERTY.

      calstorec     = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALSTORE" CRLF

                     ;
      last-mod     = ; As defined in [iCAL].

   To fetch all of the properties from the targeted VCALSTORE and not
   fetch the calendars that it contains, use:

      SELECT * FROM VCALSTORE

   To fetch all of the properties from the targeted "VCALSTORE"
   component and all of the contained calendars and all of those
   calendars' contained properties and components, use the special '*.*'
   value:

9.3.  VCAR Component

   Component Name: VCAR

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of calendar access rights.

   Formal Definition: A "VCAR" component is defined by the following
      notation:

         carc    =  "BEGIN" ":" "VCAR" CRLF
                    carprop 1*rightc
                    "END" ":" "VCAR" CRLF
                 ;
         carprop = 1*(
                 ;
                 ; 'carid' is REQUIRED,
                 ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                 ;
                  carid /
                 ;
                 ; the following are OPTIONAL,
                 ; and MAY occur more than once
                 ;
          name / decreed / other-props
         )

   Description: A "VCAR" component is a grouping of properties, and
      "VRIGHT" components, that represents access rights granted or
      denied to UPNs.

      The "CARID" property specifies the local identifier for the "VCAR"
      component.  The "NAME" property specifies a localizable display
      name.

   Example: In the following example, the UPN "foo@example.com" is given
      search access to the "DTSTART" and "DTEND" VEVENT properties.  No
      other access is specified:












Royer, et al.                 Experimental                     [Page 80]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


         BEGIN:VCAR
         CARID:View Start and End Times
         NAME:View Start and End Times
         BEGIN:VRIGHT
         GRANT:foo@example.com
         PERMISSION:SEARCH
         SCOPE:SELECT DTSTART,DTEND FROM VEVENT
         END:VRIGHT
         END:VCAR

      In this example, all UPNs are given search access to "DTSTART" and
      "DTEND" properties of VEVENT components.  "All CUs and UGs" are
      specified by the UPN value "*".  Note that this enumerated UPN
      value is not in quotes:

         BEGIN:VCAR
         CARID:ViewStartEnd2
         NAME:View Start and End Times 2
         BEGIN:VRIGHT
         GRANT:*
         PERMISSION:SEARCH
         SCOPE:SELECT DTSTART,DTEND FROM VEVENT
         END:VRIGHT
         END:VCAR

      In these examples, full calendar access rights are given to the
      CAL-OWNERS(), and a hypothetical administrator is given access
      rights to specify calendar access rights.  If no other rights are
      specified, only these two UPNs can specify calendar access rights:

         BEGIN:VCAR
         CARID:some-id-3
         NAME:Only OWNER or ADMIN Settable VCARs
         BEGIN:VRIGHT
         GRANT:CAL-OWNERS()
         PERMISSION:*
         SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VAGENDA
         END:VRIGHT
         BEGIN:VRIGHT
         GRANT:cal-admin@example.com
         PERMISSION:*
         SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VCAR
         RESTRICTION:SELECT * FROM VCAR
         END:VRIGHT
         END:VCAR

      In this example, rights to write, search, modify or delete
      calendar access are denied to all UPNs.  This example would

      disable providing different access rights to the calendar store or
      calendar.  This calendar access right should be specified with
      great care, as it removes the ability to change calendar access;
      even for the owner or administrator.  It could be used by small
      devices that do not support changing any VCAR:

         BEGIN:VCAR
         CARID:VeryRestrictiveVCAR-2
         NAME:No CAR At All
         BEGIN:VRIGHT
         DENY:*
         PERMISSION:*
         SCOPE:SELECT * FROM VCAR
         END:VRIGHT
         END:VCAR

9.4.  VRIGHT Component

   Component Name: "VRIGHT"

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of properties that describe an access
      right (granted or denied).

   Formal Definition: A "VRIGHT" component is defined by the following
      notation:

         rightc    = "BEGIN" ":" "VRIGHT" CRLF
                     rightprop
                     "END" ":" "VRIGHT" CRLF
                   ;
         rightprop = 2*(
                   ;
                   ; either 'grant' or 'deny' MUST
                   ; occur at least once
                   ; and MAY occur more than once

                   ;
                   ; the following are optional,
                   ; and MAY occur more than once
                   ;

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   Description: A "VRIGHT" component is a grouping of calendar access
      right properties.

      The "GRANT" property specifies the UPN that is being granted
      access.  The "DENY" property specifies the UPN that is being
      denied access.  The "PERMISSION" property specifies the actual
      permission being set.  The "SCOPE" property identifies the
      calendar store properties, calendar properties, components, or
      properties to which the access right applies.  The "RESTRICTION"
      property specifies restrictions on commands and results.  If the
      command does not match the restrictions, or if the results of the
      command do not match the restrictions, then it is an access
      violation.

9.5.  VREPLY Component

   Component Name: "VREPLY"

   Purpose: Provide a grouping of arbitrary properties and components
      that are the data set result from an issued command.

   Formal Definition: A "VREPLY" component is defined by the following
      notation:

      replyc           =  "BEGIN" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF
                          any-prop-or-comp
                          "END" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF
                       ;
      any-prop-or-comp = ; Zero or more iana or experimental
                         ; properties and components, in any order.


   Description: Provide a grouping of arbitrary properties and
      components that are the data set result from an issued command.

      A query can return a predictable set of arbitrary properties and
      components.  This component is used by query and other commands to
      return data that does not fit into any other component.  It may
      contain any valid property or component, even if they are not
      registered.

9.6.  VQUERY Component

   Component Name: VQUERY

   Purpose: A component describes a set of objects to be acted upon.

                ;
                / query
              )

   Description: A "VQUERY" contains properties that describe which
      properties and components the CS is requested to act upon.

      The "QUERYID" property specifies the local identifier for a
      "VQUERY" component.

      For a search, if the "TARGET" property is supplied in a "VQUERY"
      component, then the CS is to search for the query in the CALID
      supplied by the "TARGET" property value.

      For a create, the "TARGET" property MUST NOT be supplied because
      the destination container is already supplied in the "TARGET"
      property of the "VCALENDAR" component.

   Examples: see Section 6.1.1.

10.  Commands and Responses

   CAP commands and responses are described in this section.

10.1.  CAP Commands (CMD)

   All commands are sent using the CMD property.

   Property Name: CMD

   Purpose: This property defines the command to be sent.

   Value Type: TEXT

   Property Parameters: Non-standard, id, localize, latency, action or
      options.

   Conformance: This property is the method used to specify the commands
      to a CS; it can exist in any object sent to the CS.

   Description: All of the commands to the CS are supplied in this
      property.  The "OPTIONS" parameter is overloaded and its meaning
      is dependent on the CMD value supplied.

      Formal Definition: The property is defined by the following
      notation:

         cmd              = "CMD" (
                            abort-cmd
                          / continue-cmd
                          / create-cmd
                          / delete-cmd
                          / generate-uid-cmd
                          / get-capability-cmd
                          / identify-cmd
                          / modify-cmd
                          / move-cmd
                          / reply-cmd
                          / search-cmd
                          / set-locale-cmd
                          / iana-cmd
                          / x-cmd
                           ) CRLF
                         ;
         option-value    = "OPTION" "=" paramtext
                         ;
         paramtext       ; As defined in [iCAL].

   Calendaring commands allow a CUA to directly manipulate a calendar.

   Calendar access rights can be granted or denied for any commands.

10.1.1.  Bounded Latency

   A CAP command can have an associated maximum latency time by
   specifying the "LATENCY" parameter.  If the command is unable to be
   completed in the specified amount of time (as specified by the
   "LATENCY" parameter value with an "ACTION" parameter set to the "ASK"
   value), then a "TIMEOUT" command MUST be sent on the same channel".
   The reply MUST be a an "ABORT" or a "CONTINUE" command.  If the CUA
   initiated the original command, then the CS would issue the "TIMEOUT"
   command and the CUA would then have to issue an "ABORT" or "CONTINUE"
   command.  If the CS initiated the original command then the CUA would
   have to issue the "TIMEOUT" and the CS would send the "ABORT" or
   "CONTINUE".

   Upon receiving an "ABORT" command, the command must then be
   terminated.  Only the "ABORT", "TIMEOUT", "REPLY, and "CONTINUE"
   commands cannot be aborted.  The "ABORT", "TIMEOUT", and "REPLY"
   commands MUST NOT have latency set.

   Upon receiving a "CONTINUE" command the work continues as if it had
   not been delayed or stopped.  Note that a new latency time MAY be
   included in a "CONTINUE" command indicating to continue the original
   command until the "LATENCY" parameter value expires or the results of
   the original command can be returned.

   Both the "LATENCY" parameter and the "ACTION" parameter MUST be
   supplied to any "CMD" property, or nether can be added to the "CMD"
   property.  The "LATENCY" parameter MUST be set to the maximum latency
   time in seconds.  The "ACTION" parameter accepts the following
   values: "ASK" and "ABORT" parameters.

   If the maximum latency time is exceeded and the "ACTION" parameter is
   set to the "ASK" value, then "TIMEOUT" command MUST be sent.
   Otherwise, if the "ACTION" parameter is set to the "ABORT" value,
   then the command MUST be terminated and return a REQUEST-STATUS code
   of 2.0.3 for the original command.

   If a CS can both start sending the reply to a command and guarantee
   that all of the results can be sent from a command (short of
   something like network or power failure) prior to the "LATENCY"
   timeout value, then the "LATENCY" time has not expired.

   Example:

   In this example the initiator asks for the listeners capabilities.

      I: Content-Type: text/calendar
      I:
      I: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      I: VERSION:2.0
      I: PRODID:The CUA's PRODID
      I: CMD;ID=xyz12346;LATENCY=3;ACTION=ask:GET-CAPABILITY
      I: END:VCALENDAR

   # After 3 seconds

      L: Content-Type: text/calendar
      L:
      L: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      L: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      L: VERSION:2.0
      L: CMD;ID=xyz12346:TIMEOUT
      L: END:VCALENDAR

   In order to continue and give the CS more time, the CUA would issue a
   "CONTINUE" command:

      I: Content-Type: text/calendar
      I:
      I: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      I: VERSION:2.0
      I: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      I: CMD;ID=xyz12346;LATENCY=3;ACTION=ask:CONTINUE
      I: END:VCALENDAR

      L: Content-Type: text/calendar
      L:
      L: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      L: VERSION:2.0
      L: PRODID:-//someone's prodid

      L: BEGIN:VREPLY
      L: REQUEST-STATUS:2.0.3;Continued for 3 more seconds
      L: END:VREPLY
      L: END:VCALENDAR

   Here the "2.0.3" status is returned because it is not an error, it is
   a progress status sent in reply to the "CONTINUE" command.

   To abort the command and not wait any further, issue an "ABORT"
   command:

      I: Content-Type: text/calendar
      I:
      I: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      I: VERSION:2.0
      I: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      I: CMD;ID=xyz12346:ABORT
      I: END:VCALENDAR

   # Which would result in a 2.0.3 reply.

      L: Content-Type: text/calendar
      L:
      L: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      L: VERSION:2.0
      L: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      L: CMD;ID=xyz12346:REPLY
      L: BEGIN:VREPLY
      L: REQUEST-STATUS:2.0.3;Aborted As Requested.
      L: END:VREPLY
      L: END:VCALENDAR

   If the "ACTION" value had been set to "ABORT", then the listner would
   send a "7.0" error on timeout in the reply to the command that
   initiated the command that timed out.

10.2.  ABORT Command

   CMD: ABORT

   Purpose: The "ABORT" command is sent to request that the named or the
      only in-process command be aborted.  Latency MUST not be supplied
      with the "ABORT" command.

   Formal Definition: An "ABORT" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         abort-cmd    = abortparam ":" "ABORT"
                      ;
         abortparam   = *(
                      ;
                      ; the following are optional,
                      ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                      ;
                        id-param
                      / localize-param
                      ;
                      ; the following is optional,

                      / other-params
                      )

         The REPLY of any "ABORT" command is:

         abort-reply  = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                         calprops
                         abort-vreply
                        "END" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                      ;
         abort-vreply = "BEGIN" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF
                         rstatus
                         other-props
                         "END" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF

10.3.  CONTINUE Command

   CMD: CONTINUE

   Purpose: The "CONTINUE" command is only sent after a "TIMEOUT"
      command has been received to inform the other end of the session
      to resume working on a command.

   Formal Definition: A "CONTINUE" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         continue-cmd   = continueparam ":" "CONTINUE"
                      ;
         continueparam  = *(
                      ;
                      ; the following are optional,
                      ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                      ;

                      ; when the latency-param has been supplied and
                      ; MUST NOT be supplied if the latency-param is
                      ; not supplied.

                         / other-params
                         )

      The REPLY of any "CONTINUE" command is:

         continue-reply   = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                            calprops
                            continue-vreply

                            "END" ":" "VREPLY" CRLF

10.4.  CREATE Command

   CMD: CREATE

   Purpose:  The "CREATE" command is used to create one or more
      iCalendar objects in the store in the "BOOKED" or "UNPROCESSED"
      state.

      A CUA MAY send a "CREATE" command to a CS.  The "CREATE" command
      MUST be implemented by all CSs.

      The CS MUST NOT send a "CREATE" command to any CUA.

   Formal Definition: A "CREATE" command is defined by the following
      notation and the hierarchy restrictions, as defined in Section
      3.2:

         create-cmd     = createparam ":" "CREATE"
                      ;
         createparam    = *(

      If the iCalendar object being created does not have a "METHOD"
      property, then its state is "BOOKED" and it is not an [iTIP]
      scheduling object.  Use the "DELETE" command to set the state of
      an object to the "DELETED" state (tagged for deletion).  A CUA
      cannot use the "CREATE" command to create an object in the
      "DELETED" state.

      If the intention is to book an [iTIP] object, then the "METHOD"
      property MUST NOT be supplied.  Otherwise, any [iTIP] object MUST
      have a valid [iTIP] "METHOD" property value and it is a scheduling
      request being deposited into the CS with its state set to
      "UNPROCESSED".

      To create a new component in multiple containers, simply name all
      of the containers in the "TARGET" in the create command.  A new
      "VEVENT" component is created in two TARGET components.  In this
      example, the "VEVENT" component is one new [iTIP] "REQUEST" to be

      stored in two calendars.  The results would be iCalendar objects
      that conform to the [iTIP] replies as defined in [iTIP].

      This example shows two [iTIP] "VEVENT" components being created in
      each of the two supplied "TARGET" properties.  As it contains the
      "METHOD" property, they will be stored in the "UNPROCESSED" state:

10.5.  DELETE Command

   CMD: DELETE

   Purpose: The "DELETE" command physically removes the QUERY result
      from the store or marks it for deletion.

      A CUA MAY send a "DELETE" command to a CS.  The "DELETE" command
      MUST be implemented by all CSs.

      The CS MUST NOT send a "DELETE" command to any CUA.

   Formal Definition: A "DELETE" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         delete-cmd   = deleteparam ":" "DELETE"
                  ;
         deleteparam  = *(
                  ;
                  ; the following are optional,
                  ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                  ;
                       id-param
                      / localize-param
                      / latency-param
                      / option-param "MARK"
                  ;

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


                  ; The following MUST occur exactly once and
                  ; only when the latency-param has been supplied.
                  ; It MUST NOT be supplied if the latency-param
                  ; is not supplied.
                  ;
                      / action-param
                  ;
                  ; the following is optional,
                  ; and MAY occur more than once
                  ;
                      / other-params
                     )

      The "DELETE" command is used to delete calendars or components.
      The included "VQUERY" component(s) specifies the container(s) to
      delete.

      To mark a component for delete without physically removing it,
      include the "OPTIONS" parameter with its value set to the "MARK"
      value in order to alter its state to "DELETED".

      When components are deleted, only the top-most component
      "REQUEST-STATUS" properties are returned.  No "REQUEST-STATUS"
      properties are returned for components inside of the selected
      components.  There MUST be one "VREPLY" component returned for
      each object that is deleted or marked for delete.  Note that if no
      "VREPLY" components are returned, then nothing matched and nothing
      was deleted.

      Restriction Table for the "REPLY" command for any "DELETE"
      command.

         delete-reply   = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                          calprops   ; MUST include 'reply-cmd'

                        ; VCAR = carid

                        ; An instance = uid recurid
                        ;
         deleted-id    = ( relcalid / carid / uid / uid recurid
                        / queryid / tzid / sequence / x-id )

   Example: to delete a "VEVENT" component with "UID" value of
      "abcd12345" from the calendar "relcalid-22" from the current CS:

         C: Content-Type: text/calendar
         C:
         C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
         C: TARGET:relcalid-22
         C: CMD;ID:"random but unique per CUA":DELETE
         C: BEGIN:VQUERY
         C: QUERY:SELECT VEVENT FROM VAGENDA WHERE UID = 'abcd12345'
         C: END:VQUERY
         C: END:VCALENDAR

         S: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
         S: TARGET:relcalid-22
         S: CMD;ID:"random but unique per CUA":REPLY
         S: BEGIN:VREPLY
         S: UID:abcd12345

         S: REQUEST-STATUS:3.0
         S: END:VREPLY
         S: END:VCALENDAR

      One or more iCalendar objects will be returned that contain
      "REQUEST-STATUS" properties for the deleted components.  More than
      one component could have been deleted.  Any booked component and
      any number of unprocessed [iTIP] scheduling components that
      matched the QUERY value in the above example will be returned.
      Each unique "METHOD" property value that was deleted from the
      store MUST be in a separate iCalendar object.  This is because
      only one "METHOD" property is allowed in a single "VCALENDAR"
      BEGIN/END block.

10.6.  GENERATE-UID Command

   CMD: GENERATE-UID

   Purpose: The "GENERATE-UID" command returns one or more unique
      identifiers that MUST be globally unique.

      The "GENERATE-UID" command MAY be sent to any CS.  The "GENERATE-
      UID" command MUST be implemented by all CSs.

      The "GENERATE-UID" command MUST NOT be sent to a CUA.

      Response:

      The "GET-CAPABILITY" command returns information about the
      implementation at the other end of the session.  The values
      returned may differ depending on current user identify and the
      security level of the connection.

      Client implementations SHOULD NOT require any capability element
      beyond those defined in this specification or future RFC
      publications.  They MAY ignore any nonstandard, experimental
      capability elements.  The "GET-CAPABILITY" reply may return
      different results, depending on the UPN and if the UPN is
      authenticated.

      When sending a reply to a "GET-CAPABILITY" command, all of these
      MUST be supplied.  The following properties are returned in
      response to a "GET-CAPABILITY" command:

         cap-vreply     = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF

10.8.  IDENTIFY Command

   CMD: IDENTIFY

   Purpose: The "IDENTIFY" command allows the CUA to set a new identity
      to be used for calendar access.

      A CUA MAY send an "IDENTIFY" command to a CS.  The "IDENTIFY"
      command MUST be implemented by all CSs.  A CS implementation MAY
      reject all "IDENTIFY" commands.

      The CS MUST NOT send an "IDENTIFY" command to any CUA.

   Formal Definition: An "IDENTIFY" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         identify-cmd    = identifyparam ":" "IDENTIFY"
                       ;
         identifyparam   = *(
                       ;
                       ; the following are optional,
                       ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                       ;
                           id-param

                         / latency-param
                       ;
                       ; the following MUST occur exactly once and only
                       ; when the latency-param has been supplied and
                       ; MUST NOT be supplied if the latency-param is
                       ; not supplied.

                       ; a request to return to the original
                       ; authenticated identity.
                       ;
                         / option-param upn
                         )

   Response:

      A "REQUEST-STATUS" property wrapped in a "VREPLY" component with
      only one of the following request-status codes:

         2.0 Successful.

      6.4 Identity not permitted.  VCAR restriction.

   The CS determines, through an internal mechanism, if the credentials
   supplied at authentication permit the operation as the selected
   identity.  If they do, the session assumes the new identity;
   otherwise, a security error is returned.

   Example:

         C: Content-Type: text/calendar
         C:
         C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
         C: VERSION:2.0
         C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid

         S: BEGIN:VREPLY
         S: REQUEST-STATUS:6.4;Request Denied
         S: END:VREPLY
         S: END:VCALENDAR

      For the CUA to return to its original authenticated identity, the
      OPTIONS parameter is omitted:

      C: Content-Type: text/calendar
      C:
      C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      C: VERSION:2.0
      C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      C: CMD;ID=unique-per-cua-995:IDENTIFY
      C: END:VCALENDAR

   The CS may accept (2.0) or deny (6.4) the request to return to the
   original identity.

   If a CS considers the "IDENTIFY" command an attempt to violate
   security, the CS MAY terminate the [BEEP] session without any further
   notice to the CUA after sending the "REQUEST-STATUS" 6.4 reply.

10.9.  MODIFY Command

   CMD: MODIFY

   Purpose: The "MODIFY" command is used to modify existing components.

      A CUA MAY send a "MODIFY" command to a CS.  The "MODIFY" command
      MUST be implemented by all CSs.

      The CS MUST NOT send a "MODIFY" command to any CUA.

   Formal Definition: A "MODIFY" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         modify-cmd    = modifyparam ":" "MODIFY"
                       ;
         modifyparam   = *(
                       ;
                       ; the following are optional,
                       ; but MUST NOT occur more than once

                       ;
                         id-param
                       / localize-param
                       / latency-param
                       ;
                       ; the following MUST occur exactly once and only
                       ; when the latency-param has been supplied and
                       ; MUST NOT be supplied if the latency-param is
                       ; not supplied.
                       ;
                       / action-param
                       ;
                       ; the following is optional,
                       ; and MAY occur more than once
                       ;
                       / other-params
                       )

      The "MODIFY" command is used to modify existing components.  The
      TARGET property specifies the calendars that contain the
      components that are going to be modified.

      The format of the request is three components inside of
      "VCALENDAR" component:

         BEGIN:VCALENDAR
         BEGIN:VQUERY
         END:VQUERY
         BEGIN:XXX
         END:XXX
         BEGIN:XXX
         END:XXX
         END:VCALENDAR

      The "VQUERY" component selects the components that are to be
      modified.

      The "XXX" above is a named component type (VEVENT, VTODO, ...).
      Both the old and new components MUST be of the same type.

      The old-values is a component and the contents of that component
      are going to change and may contain information that helps
      uniquely identify the original component (SEQUENCE in the example
      below).  If the CS cannot find a component that matches the QUERY
      and does not have at least all of the OLD-VALUES, then a 6.1 error
      is returned.





Royer, et al.                 Experimental                    [Page 106]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


      The new-values is a component of the same type as old-values and
      new-values contains the new data for each selected component.  Any
      data that is in old-values and not in new-values is deleted from
      the selected component.  Any values in new-values that was not in
      old-values is added to the component.

      In this example, the "VEVENT" component with a "UID" property
      value of 'unique-58' has the "LOCATION" property and "LAST-
      MODIFIED" properties changed, the "VALARM" component with the
      "SEQUENCE" property with a value of "3" has its "TRIGGER" property
      disabled, the "X-LOCAL" property is removed from the "VEVENT"
      component, and a "COMMENT" property is added.

      Because "SEQUENCE" property is used to locate the "VALARM"
      component in this example, both the old-values and the new-values
      contain the "SEQUENCE" property with a value of "3".  If the
      "SEQUENCE" property were to be left out of new-values, it would
      have been deleted.

   Example:

         C: Content-Type: text/calendar
         C:
         C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
         C: VERSION:2.0
         C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
         C: TARGET:my-cal
         C: CMD:ID=unique-mod:MODIFY
         C: BEGIN:VQUERY                   <- Query to select data set.
         C: QUERY:SELECT * FROM VEVENT WHERE UID = 'unique-58'
         C: END:VQUERY
         C: BEGIN:VEVENT                   <- Start of old data.
         C: LOCATION:building 3
         C: LAST-MODIFIED:20020101T123456Z
         C: X-LOCAL:some private stuff
         C: BEGIN:VALARM
         C: SEQUENCE:3
         C: TRIGGER;RELATED=END:PT5M
         C: END:VALARM
         C: END:VEVENT                     <- End of old data.
         C: BEGIN:VEVENT                   <- Start of new data.
         C: LOCATION:building 4
         C: LAST-MODIFIED:20020202T010203Z
         C: COMMENT:Ignore global trigger.
         C: BEGIN:VALARM
         C: SEQUENCE:3
         C: TRIGGER;ENABLE=FALSE:RELATED=END:PT5M
         C: END:VALARM



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                    [Page 107]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


         C: END:VEVENT                     <- End of new data.
         C: END:VCALENDAR

      The "X-LOCAL" property was not supplied in the new-values, so it
      was deleted.  The "LOCATION" property value was altered, as was
      the "LAST-MODIFIED" value.  The "VALARM" component with a
      "SEQUENCE" property value of "3" had its "TRIGGER" property
      disabled, and the "SEQUENCE" property value did not change so it
      was not effected.  The "COMMENT" property was added.

      When it comes to inline ATTACHMENTs, the CUA only needs to
      uniquely identify the contents of the ATTACHMENT value in the
      old-values in order to delete them.  When the CS compares the
      attachment data, it is compared in its binary form.  The
      ATTACHMENT value supplied by the CUA MUST be valid encoded
      information.

      For example, to delete the same huge inline attachment from every
      VEVENT in 'my-cal' that has an "ATTACH" property value with the

      old-values:

      BEGIN:VCALENDAR
      VERSION:2.0
      PRODID:-//someone's prodid
      TARGET:my-cal
      CMD:MODIFY
      BEGIN:VQUERY
      QUERY:SELECT ATTACH FROM VEVENT
      END:VQUERY
      BEGIN:VEVENT
      ATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/basic;ENCODING=BASE64;VALUE=BINARY:
       MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICbeUwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEEBQAwdzELMAkGA1U
       EBhMCVVMxLDAqBgNVBAoTI05ldHNjYXBlIENvbW11bmljYXRpb25zIE
       ...< remainder of attachment data NOT supplied >....
      END:VEVENT
      BEGIN:VEVENT
      END:VEVENT
      END:VCALENDAR

   Here the new-values is empty, so everything in the old-values is
   deleted.

   Furthermore, the following additional restrictions apply:

   1.   One cannot change the "UID" property of a component.

   2.   If a contained component is changed inside of a selected
        component, and that contained component has multiple instances,
        then old-values MUST contain information that uniquely
        identifies the instance or instances that are changing.  It is
        valid to change more than one.  All contained components that
        match old-values will be modified.  In the first modify example
        above, if "SEQUENCE" properties were to be deleted from both the
        old-values and new-values, then all "TRIGGER" properties that
        matched the old-values in all "VALARM" components in the
        selected "VEVENT" components would be disabled.

   3.   The result of the modify MUST be a valid iCalendar object.

   Response:

   A "VCALENDAR" component is returned with one ore more "REQUEST-
   STATUS" property values.

   If any error occurred:

      No component will be changed at all.  That is, it will appear just
      as it was prior to the modify and the CAP server SHOULD return a
      "REQUEST-STATUS" property for each error that occurred.  There
      MUST be at least one error reported.

   If multiple components are selected, then what uniquely identified
   the component MUST be returned (UID, QUERYID, ...) if the component
   contains a unique identifier.  If it does not, sufficient information
   to uniquely identify the modified components MUST be returned in the
   reply.

10.11.  REPLY Response to a Command

   CMD: REPLY

   Purpose: The "REPLY" value to the "CMD" property is used to return
      the results of all other commands to the CUA.

      A CUA MUST send a "REPLY" command to a CS for any command a CS MAY
      send to the CUA.  The "REPLY" command MUST be implemented by all
      CUAs that support getting the "GET-CAPABILITY" command.

      A CS MUST send a "REPLY" command to a CUA for any command a CUA
      MAY send to the CS.  The "REPLY" command MUST be implemented by
      all CSs.

   Formal Definition: A "REPLY" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         reply-cmd    = replyparam ":" "REPLY"
                        ;
         replyparam    = *(
                        ;
                        ; The 'id' parameter value MUST be exactly the
                        ; same as the value sent in the original
                        ; CMD property.  If the original CMD did
                        ; not have an 'id' parameter, then the 'id'
                        ; MUST NOT be supplied in the REPLY.

10.12.  SEARCH Command

   CMD: SEARCH

   Purpose: The "SEARCH" command is used to return selected components
      to the CUA.

      A CUA MAY send a "SEARCH" command to a CS.  The "SEARCH" command
      MUST be implemented by all CSs.

      The CS MUST NOT send a "SEARCH" command to any CUA.

   Formal Definition: A "SEARCH" command is defined by the following
      notation:

          search-cmd   = searchparam ":" "SEARCH"
                       ;
         searchparam   = *(
                       ;
                       ; the following are optional,
                       ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                       ;
                         id-param
                       / localize-param
                       / latency-param
                       ;
                       ; the following MUST occur exactly once and only
                       ; when the latency-param has been supplied and
                       ; MUST NOT be supplied if the latency-param is
                       ; not supplied.
                       ;
                       / action-param
                       ;
                       ; the following is optional,
                       ; and MAY occur more than once
                       ;
                       / other-params
                       )

      The format of the request is the search command (search-cmd)
      followed by one or more (query) "VQUERY" components

   Response:

      The data in each result set contains one or more iCalendar
      components composed of all the selected results enclosed in a
      single "VREPLY" component per "QUERY".




Royer, et al.                 Experimental                    [Page 113]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


      Only "REQUEST-STATUS" property and the properties mentioned in the
      "SELECT" clause of the QUERY are included in the components.  Each
      "VCALENDAR" component is tagged with the "TARGET" property.

   Searching for objects

      In the example below, objects on March 10,1999 between 080000Z and
      190000Z are read.  In this case only four properties for each
      object are returned.  Two calendars are specified.  Only booked
      (vs.  scheduled) entries are to be returned (this example only
      selected VEVENT objects are to be returned):

         C: Content-Type: text/calendar
         C:
         C: BEGIN:VCALENDAR
         C: VERSION:2.0
         C: PRODID:-//someone's prodid
         C: CMD:SEARCH
         C: TARGET:relcal2
         C: TARGET:relcal3
         C: BEGIN:VQUERY
         C: QUERY:SELECT DTSTART,DTEND,SUMMARY,UID
         C:  FROM VEVENT
         C:  WHERE DTEND >= '19990310T080000Z'
         C:  AND DTSTART <= '19990310T190000Z'
         C:  AND STATE() = 'BOOKED'
         C: END:VQUERY
         C: END:VCALENDAR

      The return values are subject to VCAR filtering.  That is, if the
      request contains properties to which the UPN does not have access,
      those properties will not appear in the return values.  If the UPN
      has access to at least one property of the component, but has been
      denied access to all properties called out in the request, the
      response will contain a single "REQUEST-STATUS" property
      indicating the error.

      Here the request was successful, however one of the "VEVENT"
      components contents were not accessible (4.1).

      If the UPN has no access to any components at all, the response
      will simply be an empty data set.  The response will look the same
      if the particular components do not exist.

      If there are multiple targets, each iCalendar reply is contained
      within its own iCalendar object.

10.12.1.  Searching for VFREEBUSY

   If a CS sets the "RECUR-EXPAND" property to "TRUE" and contains the
   "VFREEBUSY" component in the "COMPONENTS" value in a reply to the
   "GET-CAPABILITY" command, then it is the CS's responsibility (and not
   the CUA's responsibility) to provide the correct "VFREEBUSY"
   information for a calendar.



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                    [Page 115]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   If a CUA issues a "CREATE" "VFREEBUSY", such a CS MUST return success
   and not store the "VFREEBUSY" component as the results would never be
   used.

   Such a CS MUST dynamically create the results of a search for
   "VFREEBUSY" components at search time when searching for STATE() =
   'BOOKED' items.

   If a CUA searches for "VFREEBUSY" components with STATE() =
   'UNPROCESSED', such a CS MUST return a "VREPLY" with no components.

   If a CUA searches for "VFREEBUSY" components without specifying the
   STATE, such a CS MUST return the same result as if STATE()='BOOKED'
   had been specified.

   For CSs that set the "CAPABILITY" "RECUR-EXPAND" property to "FALSE"
   and have the "VFREEBUSY" component in the "COMPONENTS" value in the
   "CAPABILITY" reply, a CUA MAY store the "VFREEBUSY" information on
   the CS.  These CSs then MUST return a "VFREEBUSY" component
   calculated from the stored components.  If no "VFREEBUSY" information
   is available for the "TARGET" calendar, then a "VFREEBUSY" with no
   blocked out time will be returned with a success code.  A CUA sets
   the "VFREEBUSY" time on a/those calendars by creating a "VFREEBUSY"
   component without a "METHOD" creating a "BOOKED" entry.

   If a CS does not set the "VFREEBUSY" value in the "COMPONENTS"
   "CAPABILITY" value, the CS does not support the "VFREEBUSY" component
   and all creation and searching for a "VFREEBUSY" component MUST fail.
   Examples of calendars that may be in this category are public event
   calendars that will never require scheduling with other UPNs.

10.13.  SET-LOCALE Command

   CMD: SET-LOCALE

   Purpose: The "SET-LOCALE" command is used to select the locale that
      will be used in error codes that are used in the "REQUEST-STATUS"
      property.

      A CUA MAY send a "SET-LOCALE" command to a CS.  The SET-LOCALE
      command MUST be implemented by all CSs.

      The CS MUST NOT send a "SET-LOCALE" command to any CUA.

   Formal Definition: A "SET-LOCALE" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         setlocale-cmd   = setlocaleparam ":" "SET-LOCALE"

10.14.  TIMEOUT Command

   CMD: TIMEOUT

   Purpose: The "TIMEOUT" command is only sent after a command has been
      sent with a latency value set.  When received, it means the
      command could not be completed in the time allowed.

   Formal Definition: A "TIMEOUT" command is defined by the following
      notation:

         timeout-cmd   = timeoutparam ":" "TIMEOUT"

         timeoutparam   = *(
                         ; the following are optional,
                         ; but MUST NOT occur more than once
                           id-param
                         / localize-param
                         / other-params
                         )

10.15.  Response Codes

   Numeric response codes are returned using the "REQUEST-STATUS"
   property.

   The format of these codes is described in [iCAL] and extended in
   [iTIP] and [iMIP].  The following describes new codes added to this
   set and how existing codes apply to CAP.

   At the application layer, response codes are returned as the value of
   a "REQUEST-STATUS" property.  The value type of this property is
   modified from that defined in [iCAL], in order to make the
   accompanying "REQUEST-STATUS" property text optional.

      Code              Description
      --------------------------------------------------------------
      2.0               Success.  The parameters vary with the
                        operation and are specified.

      2.0.3             In response to the client issuing an
                        "abort" reply, this reply code indicates
                        that any command currently underway was

11.  Object Registration

   This section provides the process for registration of new or modified
   properties, parameters, commands, or other modifications, additions,
   or deletions to objects.

11.1.  Registration of New and Modified Entities

   New objects are registered by the publication of an IETF Request for
   Comment (RFC).  Changes to objects are registered by the publication
   of a revision to the RFC in a new RFC.

11.2.  Post the Item Definition

   The object description MUST be posted to the new object discussion
   list: ietf-calendar@imc.org.

11.3.  Allow a Comment Period

   Discussion on a new object MUST be allowed to take place on the list
   for a minimum of two weeks.  Consensus MUST be reached on the object
   before proceeding to the next step.

11.4.  Release a New RFC

   The new object will be submitted for publication like any other
   Internet Draft requesting RFC status.

12.  BEEP and CAP

12.1.  BEEP Profile Registration

   BEEP replies will be one-to-one (1:1 MSG/RPY) if possible, and one-
      to-many (1:many MSG/ANS) when the "TARGET" property value changes.
      No more than one "TARGET" property value is allowed per reply.

   Profile Identification: specify a [URI] that authoritatively
      identifies this profile.

   http://iana.org/beep/cap/1.0

   Message Exchanged during Channel Creation:

      CUAs SHOULD supply the BEEP "localize" attributes in the BEEP
      "greeting" messages.

      CSs SHOULD supply the BEEP "localize" attributes in the BEEP
      "greeting" messages.

      CUAs SHOULD supply the BEEP "serverName" attribute at channel
      creation time to the CS, so that, if the CS is performing virtual
      hosting, the CS can determine the intended virtual host.  CSs that
      do not support virtual hosting may ignore the BEEP "serverName"
      attribute.

   Messages starting one-to-one exchanges:

      The initial message, after authentication in each direction, MUST
      be a single "text/calendar" object containing a CAP "CAPABILITY"
      CMD.  It must not be part of a MIME multipart message.

      After the initial message, a BEEP "MSG" may contain one or more
      MIME objects (at least one of which MUST be "text/calendar"), and
      each "text/calendar" MIME object MUST contain a CAP "CMD"
      property.

      Multiple iCalendar objects may be sent in a single BEEP message
      either by representing them as separate MIME text/calendar parts
      contained within a MIME multipart/mixed part or by simple
      concatenation within a single text/calendar MIME object.

      In either case, all iCalendar objects that are transmitted
      together must have the same TARGET property.

      The sending of multipart MIME entities over BEEP is not permitted
      for CAP unless the other endpoint has indicated its ability to
      accept them via the appropriate CAPABILITY.

   Messages in positive replies:

      After the initial message, a BEEP "RPY" may contain one or more
      MIME objects (at least one of which MUST be "text/calendar"), and
      each "text/calendar" MIME object MUST contain a CAP "CMD"
      property.  All "text/calendar" MIME objects in a single BEEP "RPY"
      messages MUST have the same "TARGET" property value.

      Multiple iCalendar objects may be sent in a single BEEP message by
      either representing them as separate MIME text/calendar parts
      contained within a MIME multipart/mixed part or by simple
      concatenation within a single text/calendar MIME object.

      In either case, all iCalendar objects transmitted together must
      have the same TARGET property.

      Sending multipart MIME entities over BEEP is not permitted for CAP
      unless the other endpoint has indicated its ability to accept them
      via the appropriate CAPABILITY.

   Messages in negative replies:

      Will contain any valid "text/calendar" MIME object that contains
      CAP "REQUEST-STATUS" property and a CAP "CMD" property with a
      property value of "REPLY".  And where the CS has determined the
      requested operation to be a fatal error.  And when the CS has
      performed NO operation that effected the contents of any part of
      the CS or any calendar controlled by the CS.

   Messages in one-to-many exchanges:

      After the initial message then a BEEP "MSG" may contain one or
      more MIME objects at least one of which MUST be "text/calendar"
      and each "text/calendar" MIME object MUST contain a CAP "CMD"
      property.

      The BEEP "MSG" messages can only contain MIME "multipart" MIME
      objects if the other endpoint has received a CAP "CAPABILITY"
      indicating the other endpoint supports multipart MIME objects.
      This does not prevent the endpoint from sending multiple [iCAL]
      'icalobject' objects in a single BEEP "MSG" so long as all of them
      have the same "TARGET" property value.

      Multiple iCalendar objects may be sent in a single BEEP message by
      either representing them as separate MIME text/calendar parts
      contained within a MIME multipart/mixed part or by simple
      concatenation within a single text/calendar MIME object.

      In either case, all iCalendar objects transmitted together must
      have the same TARGET property.

      The sending of multipart MIME entities over BEEP is not permitted
      for CAP unless the other endpoint has indicated its ability to
      accept them via the appropriate CAPABILITY.

   Message Syntax:

      They are CAP "text/calendar" MIME objects as specified in this
      memo.

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   Message Semantics:

      As defined in this memo.

12.2.  BEEP Exchange Styles

   [BEEP] defines three styles of message exchange:

      MSG/ANS,ANS,...,NUL -  For one to many exchanges.

      MSG/RPY -  For one to one exchanges.

      MSG/ERR -  For requests the cannot be processed due to an error.

   A CAP request targeted at more than one container MAY use a one- to-
   many exchange with a distinct answer associated with each target.  A
   CAP request targeted at a single container MAY use a one-to-one
   exchange or a one-to-many exchange.  "MSG/ERR" MAY only be used when
   an error condition prevents the execution of the request on all the
   targeted calendars.

12.3.  BEEP Connection Details

   All CAP communications must be done securely, so the initial greeting
   includes the TLS profile.

      L: <wait for incoming connection>

      I: <open connection>

      L: RPY 0 0 . 0 110
      L: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
      L:
      L: <greeting>
      L:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/TLS' />
      L: </greeting>
      L: END

      I: RPY 0 0 . 0 52
      I: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
      I:
      I: <greeting/>
      I: END

   At this point, the connection is secure.  The TLS profile 'resets'
   the connection, so it resends the greetings, advertises the CAP
   profiles that are supported, and replies with the profile selected
   (only one profile exists at this time):

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


      L: <wait for incoming connection>

      I: <open connection>

      L: RPY 0 0 . 0 110
      L: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
      L:
      L: <greeting>
      L:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/cap/1.0'/>
      L: </greeting>
      L: END

      I: RPY 0 0 . 0 110
      I: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
      I:
      I: <greeting>
      I:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/cap/1.0'/>
      I: </greeting>
      I: END

   Each channel must be authenticated before work can start, but
   starting a channel involves authentication.  Any SASL profile may be
   included, for example:

      <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SASL/OTP'/>
      <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5'/>
      <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SASL/ANONYMOUS'/>

   Example of anonymous channel:

      C: <start number='1'>
      C:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SASL/ANONYMOUS'/>
      C: </start>

      S: RPY 0 1 . 221 87
      S: Content-Type: application/beep+xml
      S:
      S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SASL/ANONYMOUS'/>
      S: END

   Example of DIGEST-MD5 channel:

      C: <start number='1'>
      C:    <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5'/>
      C: </start>

      S: RPY 0 1 . 221 87
      S: Content-Type: application/beep+xml

      S:
      S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5'/>
      S: END

   Piggybacking the "CAPABILITY" command.

   The "CAPABILITY" reply may be included during channel start (see
   RFC3080, section 2.3.1.2), as BEEP allows the start command to
   include the initial data transfer.  This reduces the number of round
   trips to initiate a CAP session.

13.  IANA Considerations

   This memo defines IANA-registered extensions to the attributes
   defined by iCalendar, as defined in [iCAL], and [iTIP].

   IANA registration proposals for iCalendar and [iTIP] are to be mailed
   to the registration agent for the "text/calendar" [MIME] content-
   type, <MAILTO: ietf-calendar@imc.org> using the format defined in
   section 7 of [iCAL].

   The the IANA has registered the profile specified in Section 12.1,
   and has selected an IANA-specific URI: http://iana.org/beep/cap/1.0.

14.  Security Considerations

   Access rights should be granted cautiously.  Without careful
   planning, it is possible to open up access to a greater degree than
   desired.

   The "IDENTIFY" command should be carefully implemented.  If it is
   done incorrectly, UPNs may gain access as other, unintended, UPNs.
   The "IDENTIFY" command may not chain; that is, the identity is always
   validated against the original UPN and not the new UPN.

   Since CAP is a profile of [BEEP], consult [BEEP]'s Section 9 for a
   discussion of BEEP-specific security issues.

   There are risks of allowing anonymous UPNs to deposit REQUEST and
   REFRESH objects (calendar spam and denial-of-service, for example).
   Implementations should consider methods to restrict anonymous
   requests to within acceptable usages.

   CS implementations might consider automatically creating VCARs that
   allow CAP ATTENDEEs in booked objects to deposit REFRESH and REPLY
   objects for those UIDs if they otherwise do not have access rather
   then opening up world access.  And they may also consider allowing
   COUNTER objects for those ATTENDEEs.



Royer, et al.                 Experimental                    [Page 125]

RFC 4324                Calendar Access Protocol           December 2005


   When an object is booked by a CUA ,the CS reply may wish to include
   warning messages to the CUA for ATTENDEEs that have CAP urls that do
   not have local UPNs as those ATTENDEES may be unable to REPLY or
   REFRESH.  Some CSs may wish this to be an error.

   Although service provisioning is a policy matter, at a minimum, all
   implementations must provide the following tuning profiles:

      o for authentication: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5

      o for confidentiality: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher)

      o for both: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher supporting client-side
      certificates)
