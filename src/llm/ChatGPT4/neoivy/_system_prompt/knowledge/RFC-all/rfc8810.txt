          Revision to Capability Codes Registration Procedures

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 5492 by making a change to the registration
   procedures for BGP Capability Codes.  Specifically, the range
   formerly designated "Private Use" is divided into three new ranges:
   "First Come First Served", "Experimental Use", and "Reserved".

1.  Introduction

   The Border Gateway Protocol uses a mechanism called "Capability
   Advertisement" [RFC5492] to enable BGP peers to tell one another
   about their optional protocol extensions.  These so-called
   "Capabilities" are signaled using code points called "Capability
   Codes".

   [RFC5492] designates the range of Capability Codes 128-255 as
   "Private Use".  Subsequent experience has shown this to be not only
   useless, but actively confusing to implementors.

   Accordingly, this document revises the registration procedures for
   the range 128-255, as follows, using the terminology defined in
   [RFC8126]:

   128-238:  First Come First Served
   239-254:  Experimental Use
   255:      Reserved

   The procedures for the ranges 1-63 and 64-127 are unchanged,
   remaining "IETF Review" and "First Come First Served", respectively.
   The full range for "First Come First Served" is now 64-238.

2.  Discussion

   The reason for providing an "Experimental Use" range is to preserve a
   range for use during early development.  Although there are few
   practical differences between "Experimental Use" and "Private Use",
   the change both makes it clear that code points from this space
   should not be used long term or in shipping products and reduces the
   consumption of the scarce Capability Codes space expended for this
   purpose.  Once classified as "Experimental Use", it should be
   considered difficult to reclassify the space for some other purpose
   in the future.

   The reason for reserving the maximum value is that it may be useful
   in the future if extension of the number space is needed.

   Since the range 128-255 was formerly designated "Private Use",
   implementors may have chosen to use code points within that range
   prior to publication of this document.  For this reason, a survey was
   conducted beginning August 14, 2015 (version 01 of the individual
   draft [SCUDDER]) to find any such uses.  A number were contributed
   and were used to seed Table 2.  Of course, there can be no guarantee
   that all uses were discovered; however, the likelihood seems high
   that remaining uses, if any, genuinely do fall under the intended use
   of "Private Use" and are restricted to some special deployment and
   are not in wide use.  Furthermore, any remaining uses would be no
   worse than any other code point collision, such as occasionally
   occurs with code point "squatting", and could be dealt with in the
   same manner.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has revised the "Capability Codes" registry as follows.

   Reference: [RFC5492] and this document.

   Note: The IETF will be the Change Controller for all future
   registrations.

   Registration procedures:

                   +=========+=========================+
                   |  Range  | Registration Procedures |
                   +=========+=========================+
                   |   1-63  | IETF Review             |
                   +---------+-------------------------+
                   |  64-238 | First Come First Served |
                   +---------+-------------------------+
                   | 239-254 | Experimental Use        |
                   +---------+-------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   IANA has made the following new allocations within the "Capability
   Codes" registry:

      +=======+============================+===========+============+

4.  Security Considerations

   This revision to registration procedures does not change the
   underlying security issues inherent in the existing [RFC5492] and
   [RFC4271].
