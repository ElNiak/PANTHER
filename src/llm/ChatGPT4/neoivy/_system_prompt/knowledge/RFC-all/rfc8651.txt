1.  Introduction

   The Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) is defined in [RFC8175].
   It provides the exchange of link-related control information between
   a modem and a router.  DLEP defines a base set of mechanisms as well
   as support for possible extensions.  This document defines one such
   extension.

   The base DLEP specification does not include any data-plane
   flow-control capability.  The extension defined in this document
   supports flow control of data traffic based on explicit messages sent
   via DLEP by a modem to indicate when a router should hold off sending
   traffic and when it should resume.  This functionality parallels the
   flow-control mechanism found in PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) per
   [RFC5578].  The extension also optionally supports DSCP-aware flow
   control ("DSCP" stands for "Differentiated Services Code Point") for
   use by Diffserv-aware modems.  (For general background on
   Differentiated Services, see [RFC2475].)  This functionality is very
   similar to that provided by Ethernet priority-based flow control; see
   [IEEE.802.1Q_2014].  The extension defined in this document is
   referred to as "Control-Plane-Based Pause".  Other flow-control
   methods are possible with DLEP; for example, see [DLEP-DIFFSERV] and
   [DLEP-CREDIT].

   Note that this mechanism only applies to traffic that is to be
   transmitted on the modem's attached data channel and not to DLEP
   control messages themselves.  Furthermore, it applies only to the
   single subnetwork that is used to connect a modem and a router, and
   for traffic sent from a router to a modem.

   This document defines a new DLEP Extension Type Value that is used to
   indicate the use of the extension; see Section 2.  Three new DLEP
   Data Items are defined in Section 3.

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Extension Usage and Identification

   The use of the Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension SHOULD be
   configurable.  To indicate that the implementation supports the use
   of the Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension, an implementation MUST
   include the Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension Type Value in the
   Extensions Supported Data Item.  The Extensions Supported Data Item
   is sent and processed according to [RFC8175].

   The Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension Type Value is 2; see
   Section 5.

3.  Extension Data Items

   Three Data Items are defined by this extension.  The Queue Parameters
   Data Item is used by a modem to provide information about the DSCPs
   it uses in forwarding.  The Pause Data Item is used by a modem to
   indicate when a router should cease sending packets, and the Restart
   Data Item is used by a modem to indicate when a router can resume
   sending packets.

3.1.  Queue Parameters

   The Queue Parameters Data Item is sent by a modem to a router to
   indicate DSCP values that may be independently paused.  This Data
   Item MUST be included in a Session Initialization Response Message
   that also contains the Control-Plane-Based Pause Extension Type Value
   in the Extensions Supported Data Item.  Updates to these parameters
   MAY be sent by a modem by including the Data Item in Session Update
   Messages.

   The Queue Parameters Data Item groups DSCPs into logical queues, each
   of which is identified by a "Queue Index" field.  The number of
   logical queues is variable, as is the number of DSCPs associated with
   each queue.  A queue size (in bytes) is provided for informational
   purposes.  Queue Index fields are numbered sequentially from zero,
   where queue index zero is a special case covering DSCPs that are not
   otherwise associated with a Queue Index field.

   An implementation that does not support DSCPs would indicate one
   queue with zero DSCPs, and the number of bytes that may be in its
   associated link transmit queue.  Additional logical queues are
   represented in a variable series of Queue Parameter Sub-Data Items.

   The format of the Queue Parameters Data Item is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Data Item Type:
      23

   Length:
      Variable

      Per [RFC8175], Length is the number of octets in the Data Item,
      excluding the Type and Length fields.

   Num Queues:
      An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of Queue Parameter
      Sub-Data Items that follow.  This field MUST contain a value of at
      least one (1).

   Scale:
      A 4-bit unsigned integer indicating the scale used in the Queue
      Size Qn field.  The valid values are:

                   +-------+--------------------------+
                   | Value | Scale                    |

                   | 0     | B - Bytes (Octets)       |
                   +-------+--------------------------+
                   | 1     | KB - Kilobytes (1024 B)  |

                   | 3     | GB - Gigabytes (1024 MB) |
                   +-------+--------------------------+

                   Table 1: Queue Size Qn Field Values

   Reserved:  A 20-bit field that MUST be set to zero (0) by the sender
      (a modem) and ignored by the receiver (a router).

3.1.1.  Queue Parameter Sub-Data Item

   Queue Parameter Sub-Data Items are an unordered list composed of
   Sub-Data Items with a common format.  The format of the Queue
   Parameter Sub-Data Item is patterned after the standard format for
   the DLEP Data Item; see [RFC8175], Section 11.3.  Any errors or
   inconsistencies encountered in parsing Sub-Data Items are handled in
   the same fashion as any other Data Item parsing error encountered in
   DLEP.  In particular, the receiving implementation MUST issue a
   Session Termination Message containing a Status Data Item with status
   code set to 130 ("Invalid Data") and transition to the Session
   Termination state.

   The format of the Queue Parameter Sub-Data Item is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Sub-Data Item Type (1)        | Length                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |                           Value...                            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   and Value has the format:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Queue Index  |             Queue Size Qn                     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Num DSCPs Qn  |  DS Field Qn  |              ...              :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                          ...                  |  DS Field Qn  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Sub-Data Item Type:
      A 16-bit unsigned integer that indicates the type and
      corresponding format of the Sub-Data Item's Value field.  Sub-Data
      Item Types are scoped within the Data Item in which they are
      carried, i.e., the Sub-Data Item Type field MUST be used together
      with the Queue Parameters Data Item Type to identify the format of
      the Sub-Data Item.  This field MUST be set to one (1) for the
      Queue Parameter Sub-Data Item.

   Length:
      Variable

      Length is the number of octets in the Sub-Data Item, excluding the
      Type and Length fields.

   Queue Index:
      An 8-bit field indicating the queue index of the queue parameter
      represented in the Sub-Data Item.  Only the first instance of a
      particular Queue Index value is meaningful.  Subsequent Sub-Data
      Items containing the same Queue Index values, if present, MAY be
      logged via a management interface and MUST otherwise be ignored.
      Note that the value 255 is reserved and MUST NOT be used in this
      field.

   Queue Size Qn:
      A 24-bit unsigned integer representing the size, in the octet
      scale indicated by the Scale field, of the queue that supports the
      traffic with the DSCPs associated with the queue index.

   Num DSCPs Qn:
      An 8-bit unsigned integer indicating the number of DSCPs
      associated with the queue index associated with the Sub-Data Item.

   DS Field Qn:
      The Data Item contains a sequence of 8-bit DS fields.  The number
      of DS fields present MUST equal the Num DSCPs Qn field value.

      The DS field structure is the same as the structure shown in
      [RFC2474].

        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |         DSCP          |  CU   |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

      DSCP: Differentiated Services Code Point

      CU: Currently Unused; MUST be zero

3.2.  Pause

   The Pause Data Item is sent by a modem to a router to indicate to its
   peer that traffic is to be suppressed, i.e., paused.  The motivating
   use case for this Data Item is when a modem's internal queue length
   exceeds a particular threshold.  Other use cases are possible, e.g.,
   when there are non-queue-related congestion points within a modem.
   Such cases are not explicitly described in this document.

   A modem can indicate that traffic is to be suppressed on a
   device-wide or destination-specific basis.  An example of when a
   modem might use device-wide suppression is when output queues are
   shared across all destinations.  Destination-specific suppression
   might be used when per-destination queuing is used.  To indicate that
   suppression applies to all destinations, a modem MUST send the Pause
   Data Item in a Session Update Message.  To indicate that suppression
   applies to a particular destination, a modem MUST send the Pause Data
   Item in a Destination Update Message.

   Each Pause Data Item identifies the traffic to be suppressed by the
   Queue Index field (Section 3.1), which in turn indicates traffic
   identified by one or more DSCPs.  The special value of 255 is used to
   indicate that all traffic is to be suppressed.

   While there is no restriction on the number of messages containing
   Pause Data Items that may be sent by a modem, a modem SHOULD include
   multiple queue indexes in the same message when possible.

   A router that receives the Pause Data Item MUST cease sending the
   identified traffic to the modem.  This may of course translate into
   the router's queues exceeding their own thresholds.  If a received
   Pause Data Item contains a Queue Index value other than 255 or a
   queue index established by a Session Initialization or Session Update
   Message, the router MUST terminate the session with a Status Data
   Item indicating "Invalid Data".

   The format of the Pause Data Item is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Data Item Type                | Length                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Queue Index  |               ...                             :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                                ...            |  Queue Index  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Data Item Type:
      24

   Length:
      Variable

      Per [RFC8175], Length is the number of octets in the Data Item,
      excluding the Type and Length fields.  It will equal the number of
      Queue Index fields carried in the Data Item.

   Queue Index:
      One or more 8-bit fields used to indicate a queue index defined by
      a Queue Parameters Data Item.  The special value of 255 indicates
      that (1) all traffic to the modem is to be suppressed when the
      Data Item is carried in a Session Update Message or (2) all
      traffic to a particular destination is to be suppressed when the
      Data Item is carried in a Destination Update Message.

3.3.  Restart

   The Restart Data Item is sent by a modem to a router to indicate to
   its peer that transmission of previously suppressed traffic may be
   resumed.  An example of when a modem might send this Data Item is
   when an internal queue length drops below a particular threshold.

   The sending of this Data Item parallels the Pause Data Item (see
   Section 3.2) and follows the same rules.  To indicate that
   transmission can resume to all destinations, a modem MUST send the
   Restart Data Item in a Session Update Message.  To indicate that
   transmission can resume to a particular destination, a modem MUST
   send the Restart Data Item in a Destination Update Message.  Finally,
   the same rules apply to queue indexes.

   A router that receives the Restart Data Item SHOULD resume
   transmission of the identified traffic to the modem.

   The format of the Restart Data Item matches the Pause Data Item
   and is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Data Item Type                | Length                        |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |  Queue Index  |               ...                             :
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      :                                ...            |  Queue Index  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Data Item Type:  25

   Length:  See Section 3.2.

   Queue Index:  See Section 3.2.

4.  Security Considerations

   The extension defined in this document introduces a new mechanism for
   flow control between a router and modem using DLEP.  The extension
   does not introduce any vulnerabilities that are inherently different
   from those documented in [RFC8175].  The approach taken to security
   in that document applies equally when running the extension defined
   in this document.

   Implementations of the extension defined in this document MUST
   support the configuration and use of TLS, as described in [RFC8175],
   in order to protect configurations where injection attacks are
   possible, i.e., when the link between a modem and router is not
   otherwise protected.

   Note that this extension does allow a compromised or impersonating
   modem to suppress transmission by the router or a switch that
   interconnects the modem and router.  Similar attacks are generally
   possible with base DLEP -- for example, an impersonating modem may
   cause a session reset, or a compromised modem can simply drop all
   traffic destined for or sent by a router.  [RFC8175] defines the use
   of TLS to protect against such impersonating attackers.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document assigns four new values and creates a new subregistry
   in the "Dynamic Link Exchange Protocol (DLEP) Parameters" registry.

5.1.  Extension Type Value

   This document adds a new assignment to the DLEP extensions registry
   named "Extension Type Values" [RFC8175], per the "Specification
   Required" policy [RFC8126].  IANA has assigned the following value:


                   +------+---------------------------+
                   | Code | Description               |
                   +======+===========================+
                   | 2    | Control-Plane-Based Pause |
                   +------+---------------------------+

                      Table 2: Extension Type Value


5.2.  Data Item Values

   This document adds three new assignments to the DLEP Data Item
   registry named "Data Item Type Values" [RFC8175], per the
   "Specification Required" policy [RFC8126].  IANA has assigned the
   following values:


                     +-----------+------------------+
                     | Type Code | Description      |
                     +===========+==================+
                     | 23        | Queue Parameters |
                     +-----------+------------------+
                     | 24        | Pause            |
                     +-----------+------------------+
                     | 25        | Restart          |
                     +-----------+------------------+

                        Table 3: Data Item Values


5.3.  Queue Parameter Sub-Data Item Values

   IANA has created a new DLEP registry named "Queue Parameter Sub-Data
   Item Type Values".

   Table 4 provides initial registry values and the registration
   policies [RFC8126] that apply:

                 +-------------+------------------------+
                 | Type Code   | Description/Policy     |
                 +=============+========================+
