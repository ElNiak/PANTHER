              Definitions of Textual Conventions (TCs) for
          Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) Management

Abstract

   This document defines two Management Information Base (MIB) modules
   that contain Textual Conventions to represent commonly used
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) management information.  The
   intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and
   used in BFD-related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
   representations.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines two MIB modules that contain Textual
   Conventions for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocols.
   These Textual Conventions should be imported by MIB modules that
   manage BFD protocols.

   Note that names of Textual Conventions defined in this document are
   prefixed with either "Bfd" or "IANA" to make it obvious to readers
   that some are specific to BFD modules, whereas others are IANA
   maintained.

   For an introduction to the concepts of BFD, see [RFC5880], [RFC5881],
   [RFC5883], [RFC6428], and [RFC7130].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB

         An IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC is always interpreted
         within the context of an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC
         value.  Every usage of the IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC

         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object be logically registered
         before the object(s) that use the
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC textual convention, if they
         appear in the same logical row.

         The value of an IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC must
         always be consistent with the value of the associated
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC object.  Attempts to set an
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object to a value inconsistent
         with the associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC must fail
         with an inconsistentValue error.

         The following size constraints for an
         IANAbfdSessAuthenticationKeyTC object are defined for the
         associated IANAbfdSessAuthenticationTypeTC values show below:

         noAuthentication(-1): SIZE(0)
         reserved(0): SIZE(0)
         simplePassword(1): SIZE(1..16)
         keyedMD5(2): SIZE(16)
         meticulousKeyedMD5(3): SIZE(16)
         keyedSHA1(4): SIZE(20)
         meticulousKeyedSHA1(5): SIZE(20)

         When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an
         index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
         sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this case,
         the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause to limit
         the number of potential instance sub-identifiers; otherwise,
         the applicable constraints MUST be stated in the appropriate
         conceptual row DESCRIPTION clauses, or in the surrounding
         documentation if there is no single DESCRIPTION clause that
         is appropriate."

4.  Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other BFD
   MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document provides the base definition of the IANA-BFD-TC-STD-MIB
   module.  This MIB module is under the direct control of IANA.  See
   Section 3 for the initial contents.  See the most updated version of
   this MIB at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianabfdtcstd-mib>.
   Assignments of IANA-BFD-TC-STD-MIB are via IETF Review [RFC5226].

   This MIB makes reference to the following documents: [RFC2578],
   [RFC2579], [RFC5880], [RFC5881] and [RFC5883], [RFC6428], and
   [RFC7130].

   IANA assigned an OID to the BFD-TC-STD-MIB module specified in this
   document as { mib-2 223 }.

   IANA assigned an OID to the IANA-BFD-TC-STD-MIB module specified in
   this document as { mib-2 224 }.
