1.  Introduction

   The IETF makes heavy use of email lists to conduct its work.
   Participants frequently need to search the archives of these lists
   and have asked for improved search capabilities, particularly when
   the search needs to cover a large period of time or cross several
   lists.  For instance, document editors, shepherds, working group
   chairs, and area directors may need to review all discussion of a
   particular draft.  That discussion may be spread across the working
   group list, one or more directorate lists, and the IETF general list.
   Occasionally, work impacts multiple groups, possibly in different
   areas, and the search must cover additional working group lists.

   The current tools for performing these searches require several
   manually coordinated steps, which are error prone.  Without a local
   copy of the archive (which may not be complete), searching most
   working group lists requires brute force effort, aided possibly by
   web search engines.

   More advanced search capabilities have been constructed for a limited
   subset of the available lists and are exposed in the "Email Archives
   Quick Search" section of the main IETF website.  While these tools
   are of great assistance, there is still significant need for
   improvement.

   The current archive mechanism could also be made more efficient.  The
   current practices involve duplicate stores (for the web and ftp
   interfaces), which impact storage and replication and are subject to
   inconsistency.

RFC 6778         List Archiving and Search Requirements     October 2012


   This memo captures the requirements for improved email list archiving
   and searching systems.

2.  List Search and Archive Requirements

2.1.  Search and Browsing

   o  The system must provide a web interface for searching and browsing
      archived messages.

   o  The system must allow browsing the entire archive of a given list
      by thread or by date.

   o  The system must allow browsing the results of a search by thread
      or by date.

         Both threading based on Message-Id/References/In-Reply-To and
         threading based on same subject line (modulo short prefixes
         like re: and fwd:) should be taken into account.

   o  The system must allow searching across any subset of the archived
      lists (one list, a selection of lists, or all lists).

   o  The system must allow searching of any combination (using AND, OR,
      and NOT operators) of the following attributes.  Richer search
      capabilities are highly desirable.

      -  string occurring in sender name or email address

      -  date range

      -  string occurring in Subject

      -  string occurring in message body

      -  string occurring in message header (in particular, exact match
         of Message-Id)

            For instance, it would be nice to search the entire archive
            for instances of a message with a given Message-ID with a
            URL like <http://datatracker.ietf.org/mlarchive/
            msg?id=4EA6E023.6010603@example.com>

RFC 6778         List Archiving and Search Requirements     October 2012


   o  Individual messages must be representable by a long-term stable
      URI that can be shared between users.  That is, the URI must be
      suitable for reference in an email message.

      -  It would be preferable for that URI to appear in an Archived-At
         header field in the message [RFC5064].

   o  Searches should be representable by a URI that can be shared
      between users.

      -  Such URIs should be long-term stable.

      -  The search may be re-executed when the URI is referenced.  It
         is acceptable for the same URI to produce different results if
         accessed at different times or by different people (for
         example, by reflecting additional messages that may match the
         search criteria or reflecting changes in access authorization
         to lists with restricted archives).

   o  When the system requires credentials, it must use the
      datatracker's authentication system.

      -  While the vast majority of archived lists have an open access
         policy, some archived lists have restricted archives.

      -  The system must not require credentials for browsing or
         searching lists with open archives.  (But it is acceptable for
         a user to browse or search such lists while logged in.)

      -  The system must make it possible to limit access to a
         restricted archive based on login credentials.

      -  Messages from restricted archives must be distinguishable from
         messages from unrestricted archives in any search results.

RFC 6778         List Archiving and Search Requirements     October 2012


2.2.  Archiving Active Lists

   o  The archive system must accept messages handled by various mail
      list manager packages.

      -  Lists hosted on the IETF systems are served by Mailman
         [Mailman].

      -  Lists hosted at other organizations may use other packages.

         *  The archive system must accept messages through subscribing
            to such an external list.

         *  The archive system may support other mechanisms for
            accepting messages into the archive.

2.3.  Importing Messages from Other Archives

   Lists hosted at other systems are sometimes moved to the IETF
   servers, and their archive is moved with them.  The archiving system
   must be able to import these archives.

   o  At a minimum, the archive system must be able to import mbox
      formatted archives [RFC4155] [Mbox].

   o  The archive system should be able to import Maildir and Maildir-
      like (the key characteristic being one-message-per-file) formatted
      archives [Maildir].

   o  It is acceptable to use a separate utility to convert between
      these formats before import, as long as the conversion is
      lossless.

2.4.  Exporting Messages from the Archives

   The archive system must allow both users and administrators to export
   messages.

   o  The archive system must support exporting messages in the mbox
      format.

   o  The archive system should support exporting messages in the
      Maildir format.

   o  The archive system must support exporting the entire archive of a
      given list.

RFC 6778         List Archiving and Search Requirements     October 2012


   o  The archive system must support exporting all messages from a
      given list within a given date range.

   o  The archive system should allow exporting the results of any
      supported search query.

2.5.  Redundancy

   o  The systems must facilitate providing archive, search, and browse
      functions through geographically distributed servers.

      -  The systems must support a single active and single standby
         server.  This reflects the current operating configuration and
         is expected to be the initial deployment model.

      -  The systems should support a single active and multiple standby
         servers.

      -  The systems should support multiple active servers for the
         search and browse functions.  Support for multiple active
         archive servers is not a requirement.

      -  The amount of traffic generated to ensure data replication
         between servers should be on the order of the size of any new/
         changed messages in the archives.

         *  It is acceptable for replication to be part of the archival
            system itself (such as using the replication mechanisms from
            an underlying database).

         *  It is acceptable to rely on replication of the underlying
            filesystem objects (using rsync of one or more directory
            trees, for example), but only if the objects in the
            underlying filesystem are formatted such that the size of
            the replication data is on the order of the size of any new/
            changed messages in the archives.

2.6.  Archive Administration

   o  The archive system must support adding and removing lists to be
      archived.

   o  The system must allow the administrator to add messages to and
      delete messages from an archived list.  The system should log such
      actions.

2.7.  Transition Requirements

   There are many existing archived messages containing embedded links
   into the existing MHonArc [MHonArc] mail archive.  These links must
   continue to work, but they should reach the message as archived in
   the new system.

3.  Internationalized Address Considerations

   The archive and search functions should anticipate internationalized
   email addresses as discussed in the following three documents --
   [RFC6531], [RFC6532], and [IMAP-UTF8].  There is no firm requirement
   at this time.

4.  IMAP Access

   Requirements for allowing access to the archives using IMAP are
   captured in [IMAP-ARCH].  The archive system must anticipate
   integrating with a system that provides IMAP access.

5.  Security Considerations

   Creating a new tool for searching and archiving IETF email lists does
   not affect the security of the Internet in any significant fashion.

   Searching can be I/O and CPU intensive.  The implementors of this
   tool should consider the potential for maliciously crafted searches
   attempting to consume all available resources.  Similarly, the
   implementors should consider the potential for denial-of-service
   attacks through making many connections to the browsing system or
   rapid navigating within it.

   Preserving the integrity of the archives is important.  The
   implementors should ensure that administrative access is
   appropriately authenticated, and that message paths into the archive
   are appropriately configured to avoid unauthorized message insertion.

6.  Acknowledgements

   brainstorm.  Text suggestions from Alexey Melnikov, Pete Resnick, S.
   Moonesamy, Francis Dupont, and Murray Kucherawy have been
