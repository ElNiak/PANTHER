1.0 Introduction

   This document is a product of the SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group.
   It defines a MIB module for managing devices with Advanced Peer-to-
   Peer Networking (APPN) Extended Border Node (EBN) capabilities.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
   [13].

2.0 The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of six major
   components.  They are:

   o   the overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [7].

   o   the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [3], - the mechanisms used for
       describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o   the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2], - the core set of managed
       objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

   o   the protocol, STD 15, RFC 1157 [1] and/or RFC 1905 [6] and/or RFC
       2272 [8] -- the protocol for accessing managed information.

   o   the user-based security model defined in RFC 2274 [10].

   o   the view-based access control model defined in RFC 2275 [11].

   Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [4], and conformance
   statements are defined in RFC 1904 [5].  Common applications are
   defined in RFC 2273 [9].

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translation.

RFC 2457                Extended Border Node MIB           November 1998


3.0 Overview

   This document identifies the proposed set of objects for monitoring
   the configuration and active characteristics of devices with EBN
   capabilities.  The Extended Border Node function is an APPN
   enhancement for an APPN network node (NN).  It supports topology
   isolation, subnet interconnection, and session establishment between
   subnets.

   In a single APPN network, all network topology information is
   propagated to all network nodes.  Directory searches can also be
   forwarded to all network nodes.  As the network grows, this network
   traffic could become prohibitive.  Also, in networks where different
   enterprises are connected via APPN, it may be desirable to shield an
   enterprise from the network traffic of another enterprise.  EBNs
   allow customers to partition a network into subnets to reduce or
   shield such network traffic.

   An EBN provides this function by blocking topology information
   exchange between subnets, and controlling where directory searches
   are forwarded.  A subnetwork is a cluster of APPN NNs which share the
   same network topology.  Subnetwork boundaries, or partitions, occur
   where an EBN and an NN adjacent to it have different network
   identifiers (NETIDs).  They may also occur where an EBN and adjacent
   NN have the same NETID but are configured to have a subnetwork
   boundary.

   The connection between two APPN nodes is an APPN transmission group
   (TG).  A TG at a subnet boundary is called an Intersubnetwork
   Transmission Group (ISTG).

   The subnet in which an EBN resides is called its native subnetwork.
   The subnet across the subnet boundary is called the non-native
   subnetwork, with respect to the EBN.

   A cost of the EBN function is that customers may have difficulty
   determining the end-to-end route of sessions that cross subnet
   boundaries, and understanding how the EBN will control directory
   searches between subnets.  This MIB addresses these issues.

   Another challenge facing customers is to identify subnet boundaries
   formed by EBNs.  The SNANAU APPN MIB [14] identifies subnet
   boundaries in the appnNnTopology group.  The SNANAU APPN MIB provides
   management of APPN objects, and contains some tables that are
   extended by this MIB.

   In this document, we describe EBN managed objects.

RFC 2457                Extended Border Node MIB           November 1998


   The EBN terms and overall architecture are available from the
   networking.raleigh.ibm.com ftp site [15].

   Highlights of the management functions supported by the EBN MIB
   module include the following:

   o   Identifying the subnet affiliation of LUs (logical units)

   o   Identifying session routes in non-native subnets, with
       correlation to the route in the native subnet provided in the
       SNANAU APPN MIB.

   o   Identifying the COS (Class of Service) mappings between subnets.

   o   Identifying the subnet routing lists

   This MIB module does not support:

   o   Configuration of EBN nodes.

   o   Historical information about session initiation failures.

   o   Peripheral Border Node (PBN) support.  PBN is an APPN function
       that only supports communication to adjacent subnetworks, and is
       not expected to be widely implemented.

   o   Traps.  The APPN MIB contains a trap for Alert conditions that
       may affect EBN resources.  Although no APPN/EBN Alerts are
       defined today in the APPN MIB [14], they could exist in the
       future.  The value for the affectedObject object contained in the
       alertTrap is determined by the implementation.  It may contain a
       VariablePointer from the EBN MIB.

3.1 EBN MIB Structure

   The EBN MIB module contains the following groups of objects:

   o   ebnDir - subnet information about LUs.

   o   ebnIsRscv - provides the RSCV (Route Selection Control
       Vector) and COS for the subnetwork on the BIND destination side
       of the EBN.

   o   ebnDirConfig - objects related to the EBN directory.

   o   ebnCos - COS mapping between subnetworks,





Clouston & Moore            Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2457                Extended Border Node MIB           November 1998


   o   ebnSubnetRoutingList - the customer-supplied list of where to
       forward search requests.

   o   hbn - HPR (High Performance Routing) EBN intermediate session
       information.

   These groups are described below in more detail.

3.1.1 enbDir group

   The ebnDir group contains the ebnDirTable, which is an extension to
   the appnDirTable.  It specifies the subnet affiliation of LUs in the
   EBN's directory.

3.1.2 ebnIsRscv group

   The ebnIsRscv group contains the ebnIsRscvTable, which is an
   extension to the appnIsInTable.  The appnIsInTable only allows for
   the RSCV and COS name for one subnetwork traversed by a session.
   This extension contains the RSCV and COS name for the other
   subnetwork.

   When an EBN changes RSCVs before forwarding a BIND, appnIsInRouteInfo
   contains the incoming RSCV, and ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute contains
   the outgoing RSCV.

   The following three cases illustrate the contents of
   appnIsInRouteInfo and ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute at Extended Border
   Nodes.

   1.  EBN connected to another EBN

          **subnet 1**|-----ISTG ------|**subnet 2**
                     EBN1             EBN2
          PLU                                    SLU
          ---------------------------->|
                (1)   |--------------->|
                              (2)      |---------->
                                            (3)

          PLU = Primary Logical Unit (session initiator)
          SLU = Secondary Logical Unit (session destination)

       The value of the appnIsInRouteInfo object at EBN1 is the RSCV
       containing the route, represented by (1), from the PLU (or the
       entry EBN in its subnet) to EBN2.  The value of
       ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute object at EBN1 is the RSCV, represented
       by (2), containing the one-hop route from EBN1 to EBN2.  The

RFC 2457                Extended Border Node MIB           November 1998


       appnIsInRouteInfo object at EBN2 also contains the RSCV
       represented by (2).  The value of ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute in
       EBN2 is the RSVC containing the route to the SLU (or to the next
       subnet's entry EBN), represented by (3).

   2.  EBN connected to a NN or PBN

          **subnet 1**|-----ISTG ------|**subnet 2**
                     EBN1            NN/PBN
          PLU                                    SLU
          ---------------------------->|
              (1)     |--------------------------->
                                   (2)

       The value of the appnIsInRouteInfo object at EBN1 is the RSCV
       containing the route from the PLU (or the entry EBN in its
       subnet) to the NN or PBN, represented by (1).  The value of the
       ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute object at EBN1 is the RSCV containing
       the route from EBN1 to the SLU, represented by (2).  Note that
       the SLU must be in subnet 2, because the entry node is an NN or
       PBN rather than an EBN.  The appnIsInRouteInfo object at NN/PBN
       contains the same RSCV, as represented by (2).

   3.  NN or PBN connected to EBN

          **subnet 1**|-----ISTG ------|**subnet 2**
                    NN/PBN            EBN1
          PLU                                    SLU
          ---------------------------->|
                    (1)                |---------->
                                            (2)

       The value of the appnIsInRouteInfo object at the NN/PBN is the
       RSCV containing the route from the PLU to EBN1, represented by
       (1).  Note that the PLU must be in subnet 1, because the exit
       node is an NN/PBN rather than an EBN.  The appnIsInRouteInfo
       object at EBN1 contains the same RSCV.  The value of the
       ebnIsRscvDestinationRoute object at EBN1 is the RSCV containing
       the route from EBN1 to the SLU (or the next subnet's entry border
       node), as represented by (2).

   The following three cases illustrate the contents of
   ebnIsRscvDestinationCos at Extended Border Nodes.

          PLU = Primary Logical Unit (session initiator)
          SLU = Secondary Logical Unit (session destination)

       The value of ebnIsRscvDestinationCos object at EBN1 is COS A.
       The value of ebnIsRscvDestinationCos object at EBN2 is COS B.

   2.   EBN connected to a NN or PBN

          **subnet 1**|-----ISTG ------|**subnet 2**
                     EBN1            NN/PBN

          ----------->|
                                     COS B
                      |--------------------------->

       The value of the ebvIsRscvDestinationCos object at EBN1 is COS B.

   3.  NN or PBN connected to EBN

          **subnet 1**|-----ISTG ------|**subnet 2**
                    NN/PBN            EBN1
          PLU                                    SLU
                 COS A
          ---------------------------->|
                                           COS B
                                       |---------->

       The value of the ebnIsRscvDestinationCos object at the EBN2 is
       COSB.

3.1.3 ebnDirConfig group

   The ebnDirConfig group consists of simple objects that provide EBN-
   specific information about directory caching and the local default
   value for the maximum number of subnetworks a LOCATE search procedure
   may traverse.

RFC 2457                Extended Border Node MIB           November 1998


3.1.4 ebnCos group

   The ebnCos group contains the ebnCosMapTable, which specifies how COS
   values are mapped between the non-native subnetwork and the native
   subnetwork.

3.1.5  ebnSubnetRoutingList group

   The ebnSubnetRoutingList group contains information about the
   customer-supplied EBN subnetwork routing list, which indicates to
   which adjacent nodes an EBN will forward LOCATE search requests. It
   consists of the following tables:

   1.  ebnSubnetSearchTable

       This table has an entry for each LU name that has a defined
       subnet routing list.  The LU name may identify a single LU, or it
       may contain a wildcard character that could identify a group of
       LUs (partial wildcard) or all LUs (full wildcard).  The objects
       in the table indicate whether the EBN may add dynamic entries to
       the subnet routing list, and whether the subnet routing list
       entries may be reordered for better search performance.

   2.  ebnSearchTable

       This table has an entry for each control point name which is
       included in a multi-subnet search for a particular LU name.  The
       index to the table is the LU name to be searched for, and an
       index which lists the order in which the CP names are to be
       searched.  Both the CP name and the LU name entries in the table
       allow for partial and full wildcards.  The CP name also allows
       for  special entries that indicate that the EBN will search
       itself and its own native subnetwork at this point in the search,
       or will search all native EBNs.

3.1.6 hbn group

   The hbn group contains information about HBN (HPR EBN) intermediate
   sessions.  The hbnIsInTable is an extension to the appnIsInTable.
   This table is present for intermediate sessions when there are back-
   to-back RTP (Rapid Transport Protocol) connections in an HBN.  It
   provides the NCE ID (network connection endpoint identifier) and TCID
   (transport connection identifier) for the second RTP connection.

            "This object specifies the CP(s) to which a search should be
            forwarded.  It either follows the SnaNAUWildcardName textual
            convention or takes one of the following special formats:

               '*' indicates that all native EBNs and all adjacent non-
               native EBNs and NNs may be added to the routing list
               dynamically,

               '*SELF' indicates that the EBN should search itself and
               its native subnetwork at this time during the
               cross-subnet search,

               '*EBNS' indicates all native EBNs.

            Because the characters allowed in a CP name come from a
            restricted character set, and because the three formats
            listed here use no special characters, this object is not
            subject to internationalization."

5.0 Security Considerations

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information SHOULD be employed in such environments.  An
   authentication protocol is defined in [10].  A protocol for access
   control is defined in [11].

   None of the read-only objects in the EBN MIB reports a password, user
   data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.  Some
   enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as
   information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets;



Clouston & Moore            Standards Track                    [Page 24]

RFC 2457                Extended Border Node MIB           November 1998


   such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the
   objects in the MIB.

   There are no read-write objects in the EBN MIB.

6.0 Intellectual Property

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to

   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such
   proprietary rights by implementers or users of this specification can
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any
