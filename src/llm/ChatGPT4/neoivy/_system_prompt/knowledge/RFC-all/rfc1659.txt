1.  Introduction

   This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it defines objects for the management of
   RS-232-like devices.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

RFC 1659                    RS-232-like MIB                    July 1994


      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      o    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

   The RS-232-like Hardware Device MIB applies to interface ports that
   might logically support the Interface MIB, a Transmission MIB, or the
   Character MIB.  The most common example is an RS-232 port with modem
   signals.

   The RS-232-like Hardware Device MIB is mandatory for all systems that
   have such a hardware port supporting services managed through some
   other MIB.

   The MIB includes multiple similar types of hardware, and as a result
   contains objects not applicable to all of those types.  The
   compliance definitions herein thus have a general group for all
   implementations, and separate groups for the different types of
   ports, such as asynchronous and synchronous.

   The RS-232-like Hardware Port MIB includes RS-232, RS-422, RS-423,
   V.35, and other asynchronous or synchronous, serial physical links
   with a similar set of control signals.

   The MIB contains objects that relate to physical layer connections.
   Such connections may provide interesting hardware signals (other than
   for basic data transfer), such as RNG and DCD.  Hardware ports also
   have such attributes as speed and bits per character.

RFC 1659                    RS-232-like MIB                    July 1994


   The MIB comprises one base object and four tables, detailed in the
   following sections.  The tables contain objects for all ports,
   asynchronous ports, and input and output control signals.

3.1.  Relationship to Interface MIB

   The RS-232-like MIB is one of many MIBs designed for layered use as
   described in the Interface MIB [5].  In most implementations where it
   is present, it will be in the lowest interface sublayer, that is, the
   RS-232-like MIB represents the physical layer, providing service to
   higher layers such as the Character MIB [6] or PPP MIB [7].

   The Interface MIB's ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not
   relevant to the RS-232-like MIB.

   The RS-232-like MIB is relevant for ifType values rs232(33), v35(45),
   and perhaps others.

   The RS-232-like MIB requires the conformance groups ifGeneralGroup,
   and ifFixedLengthGroup.

   The value of ifSpeed is the same as rs232PortOutSpeed.

   Usefulness of error counters in this MIB depends on the octet
   counters in ifFixedLengthGroup.
