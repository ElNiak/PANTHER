1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
      1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
      [12].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [13].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [15].

RFC 2954                Frame Relay Service MIB             October 2000


   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2.  Overview

   These objects are used to manage a frame relay Service.  At present,
   this applies to the following value of the ifType variable in the
   IF-MIB [26]:

        frameRelayService (44)

   This section provides an overview and background of how to use this
   MIB and other potential MIBs to manage a frame relay service.

2.1.  Scope of MIB

   The Frame Relay Service MIB supports Customer Network Management
   (CNM) of a frame relay network service.  Through the use of this and
   other related MIBs, a frame relay service customer's NMS can monitor
   the customer's UNI/NNI logical ports and PVCs.  It provides customers
   with access to configuration data, performance monitoring
   information, and fault detection for the delivered frame relay
   service.  As an option, an SNMP agent supporting the Frame Relay
   Service MIB may allow customer-initiated PVC management operations
   such as creation, deletion, modification, activation, and
   deactivation of individual PVCs.  However, internal aspects of the
   network (e.g., switching elements, line cards, and network routing
   tables) are beyond the scope of this MIB.

   The Frame Relay Service MIB models all interfaces and PVCs delivered
   by a frame relay service within a single virtual SNMP system for the
   purpose of comprehensively representing the customer's frame relay
   service.  The customer's interfaces and PVCs may physically exist on
   one or more devices within the network topology.  An SNMP agent



Rehbehn & Fowler            Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 2954                Frame Relay Service MIB             October 2000


   providing support for the Frame Relay Service MIB as well as other
   appropriate MIBs to model a single virtual frame relay network
   service is referred to as a Frame Relay Service (FRS) agent.
   Internal communication mechanisms between the FRS agent and
   individual devices within the frame relay network delivering the
   service are implementation specific and beyond the scope of this MIB.

   The customer's NMS will typically access the SNMP agent implementing
   the Frame Relay Service MIB over a frame relay permanent virtual
   connection (PVC).  SNMP access over a frame relay PVC is achieved
   through the use of SNMP over UDP over IP encapsulated in Frame Relay
   according to STD 55, RFC2427 and ITU X.36 Annex D [23].  Alternate
   access mechanisms and SNMP agent implementations are possible.

   This MIB will NOT be implemented on user equipment (e.g., DTE).  Such
   devices are managed using the Frame Relay DTE MIB (RFC2115[18]).
   However, concentrators may use the Frame Relay Service MIB instead of
   the Frame Relay DTE MIB.

   This MIB does not define managed objects for the physical layer.
   Existing physical layer MIBs (e.g., DS1 MIB) and Interface MIB will
   be used as needed in FRS Agent implementations.

   This MIB supports frame relay PVCs.  This MIB may be extended at a
   later time to handle frame relay SVCs.

   A switch implementation may support this MIB for the purpose of
   configuration and control of the frame relay service beyond the scope
   of traditional customer network management applications.  A number of
   objects (e.g. frLportTypeAdmin) support administrative actions that
   impact the operation of frame relay switch equipment in the network.
   This is reflected in the differences between the two MIB compliance
   modules:

      o  the frame relay service compliance module
         (frnetservCompliance), and

      o  the frame relay switch compliance module
         (frnetSwitchCompliance).

   The frame relay service compliance module does not support the
   administrative control objects used for switch management.

2.2.  Transiting Multiple Frame Relay Networks

   This MIB is only used to manage a single frame relay service offering
   from one network service provider.  Therefore, if a customer PVC
   traverses multiple networks, then the customer must poll a different
   FRS agent within each frame relay network to retrieve the end-to-end
   view of service.

   Figure 1 illustrates a customer ("User B") NMS accessing FRS agents
   in three different frame relay networks (I, J, and K).

2.3.  Access Control

   A frame relay network is shared amongst many frame relay subscribers.
   Each subscriber will only have access to their information (e.g.,
   information with respect to their interfaces and PVCs).  The FRS agent
   should provide instance level granularity for MIB views.

2.4.  Frame Relay Service MIB Terminology

   Access Channel - An access channel generically refers to the DS1/E1
   or DS3/E3-based UNI access channel or NNI access channel across which
   frame relay data transits.  An access channel is the access pathway
   for a single stream of user data.

   Within a given DS1 line, an access channel can denote any one of the
   following:

   o  Unchannelized DS1 - the entire DS1 line is considered an access
      channel. Each access channel is comprised of 24 DS0 time slots.

   o  Channelized DS1 - an access channel is any one of 24 channels.
      Each access channel is comprised of a single DS0 time slot.

   o  Fractional DS1 - an access channel is a grouping of NxDS0 time
      slots (NX56/64 Kbps, where N = 1-23 DS0 Time slots per Fractional
      DS1 Access Channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or
      non-consecutive order.

   Within a given E1 line, a channel can denote any one of the following:

   o  Unchannelized E1 - the entire E1 line is considered a single
      access channel.  Each access channel is comprised of 31 E1 time
      slots.

   o  Channelized E1 - an access channel is any one of 31 channels.
      Each access channel is comprised of a single E1 time slot.

   o  Fractional E1 - an access channel is a grouping of N E1 time
      slots (NX64 Kbps, where N = 1-30 E1 time slots per FE1 access
      channel) that may be assigned in consecutive or non-consecutive
      order.

   Within a given unformatted line, the entire unformatted line is
   considered an access channel. Examples include RS-232, V.35, V.36 and
   X.21 (non-switched), and unframed E1 (G.703 without G.704).

   Access Rate - The data rate of the access channel, expressed in
   bits/second.  The speed of the user access channel determines how
   rapidly the end user can inject data into the network.

   Bc - The Committed Burst Size (Bc) is the maximum amount of
   subscriber data (expressed in bits) that the network agrees to
   transfer, under normal conditions, during a time interval Tc.





Rehbehn & Fowler            Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 2954                Frame Relay Service MIB             October 2000


   Be - The Excess Burst Size (Be) is the maximum amount of subscriber
   data (expressed in bits) in excess of Bc that the network will
   attempt to deliver during the time interval Tc.  This data (Be) is
   delivered in general with a lower probability than Bc.

   CIR - The Committed Information Rate (CIR) is the subscriber data
   rate (expressed in bits/second) that the network commits to deliver
   under normal network conditions.  CIR is averaged over the time
   interval Tc (CIR = Bc/Tc).

   DLCI - Data Link Connection Identifier

   Logical Port - This term is used to model the frame relay "interface"
   on a device.

   NNI - Network to Network Interface

   Permanent Virtual Connection (PVC) - A virtual connection that has
   its end-points and bearer capabilities defined at subscription time.

   Time slot (E1) - An octet within the 256-bit information field in
   each E1 frame is defined as a time slot.  Time slots are position
   sensitive within the 256-bit information field.  Fractional E1 service
   is provided in contiguous or non-contiguous time slot increments.

   Time slot (DS0) - An octet within the 192-bit information field in
   each DS1 frame is defined as a time slot.  Time slots are position
   sensitive within the 192-bit information field. Fractional DS1
   service is provided in contiguous or non-contiguous time slot
   increments.

   UNI - User to Network Interface

   N391 - Full status (status of all PVCs) polling counter

   N392 - Error threshold

   N393 - Monitored events count

   T391 - Link integrity verification polling timer

   T392 - Polling verification timer

   nT3 - Status enquiry timer

   nN3 - Maximum status enquiry counter

2.5.  Relation to Other MIBs

2.5.1.  System Group

   Use the System Group of the SNMPv2-MIB [27] to describe the Frame
   Relay Service (FRS) agent.  The FRS agent may be monitoring many
   frame relay devices in one network.  The System Group does not
   describe frame relay devices monitored by the FRS agent.

   sysDescr:  ASCII string describing the FRS agent.
              Can be up to 255 characters long. This field is
              generally used to indicate the network providers
              identification and type of service offered.

   sysObjectID:  Unique OBJECT IDENTIFIER (OID) for the
                 FRS agent.

   sysUpTime:  Clock in the FRS agent; TimeTicks
               in 1/100s of a second.  Elapsed type since
               the FRS agent came on line.

   sysContact:  Contact for the FRS agent.
                ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

   sysName:  Domain name of the FRS agent, for example,
             acme.com

   sysLocation:  Location of the FRS agent.
                 ASCII string of up to 255 characters.

   sysServices:  Services of the managed device.  The value "2",
                 which implies that
                 the frame relay network is providing
                 a subnetwork level service, is recommended.

2.5.2.  Interfaces Table (ifTable, ifXtable)

   This specifies how the Interfaces Group defined in the IF MIB [26]
   shall be used for the management of frame relay based interfaces, and
   in conjunction with the Frame Relay Service MIB module.  This memo
   assumes the interpretation of the evolution of the Interfaces group
   to be in accordance with: "The interfaces table (ifTable) contains
   information on the managed resource's interfaces.  Each sub-layer
   below the internetwork layer of a network interface is considered an
   interface."  Thus, the ifTable allows the following frame relay-based
   interfaces to be represented as table entries:





Rehbehn & Fowler            Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 2954                Frame Relay Service MIB             October 2000


   -  Frame relay interfaces in equipment (e.g., switches, routers or
      networks) supporting frame relay.  This level is concerned with
      generic frame counts and not with individual virtual connections.

   In accordance with the guidelines of ifTable, frame counts per
   virtual connection are not covered by ifTable, and are considered
   interface specific and covered in the Frame Relay Service MIB module.
   In order to interrelate the ifEntries properly, the Interfaces Stack
   Group shall be supported.

   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for frame relay follow.

   Object                 Use for the generic Frame Relay layer
   ======                 =============================================
   ifIndex                Each frame relay port is represented by an
                          ifEntry.

   ifDescr                Description of the frame relay interface.
                          ASCII string describing the UNI/NNI logical
                          port.  Can be up to 255 characters long.

   ifType                 The value allocated for Frame Relay Service
                          is equal to 44.

   ifMtu                  Set to maximum frame size in octets for this
                          frame relay logical port.

   ifSpeed                Peak bandwidth in bits per second available
                          for use. This could be the speed of the
                          logical port and not the access rate. Actual
                          user information transfer rate (i.e., access
                          rate) of the UNI or NNI logical port in bits
                          per second (this is not the clocking speed).
                          For example, it is 1,536,000 bits per second
                          for a DS1-based UNI/NNI logical port and
                          1,984,000 bits per second for an E1-based
                          UNI/NNI logical port.

   ifPhysAddress          The primary address for this logical port
                          assigned by the frame relay interface
                          provider.  An octet string of zero length if
                          no address is used for this logical port.

   ifAdminStatus          The desired administrative status of the
                          frame relay logical port.

   ifOperStatus           The current operational status of the Frame
                          Relay UNI or NNI logical port.

   ifLastChange           The value of sysUptime at the last
                          re-initialization of the logical port.  The
                          value of sysUpTime at the time the logical
                          port entered its current operational state.
                          If the current state was entered prior to the

                          management subsystem, then this object
                          contains a zero value.

   ifInOctets             The number of received octets.  This counter
                          only counts octets from the beginning of the
                          frame relay header field to the end of user
                          data.

   ifInUcastPkts          The number of received unerrored, unicast
                          frames.

   ifInDiscards           The number of received frames discarded.
                          Specifically, frames discarded due to ingress
                          buffer congestion and traffic policing.

   ifInErrors             The number of received frames that are
                          discarded because of an error. Specifically,
                          frames that are too long or too short, frames
                          that are not a multiple of 8 bits in length,
                          frames with an invalid or unrecognized DLCI,
                          frames with an abort sequence, frames with
                          improper flag delimitation, and frame that
                          fail FCS.

   ifInUnknownProtos      The number of packets discarded because of an
                          unknown or unsupported protocol.  For Frame
                          Relay Service interfaces, this counter will
                          always be zero.

   ifOutOctets            The number of transmitted octets.  This
                          counter only counts octets from the beginning
                          of the frame relay header field to the end of
                          user data.

   ifOutUcastpkts         The number of unerrored, unicast frames sent.

   ifOutDiscards          The number of frames discarded in the egress
                          direction. Possible reasons are as follows:
                          policing, congestion.

   ifOutErrors            The number of frames discarded in the egress
                          direction because of an error. Specifically,
                          frames that are aborted due to a transmitter
                          underrun.

   ifName                 This variable is not applicable for Frame
                          Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this
                          variable contains a zero-length string.

   ifInMulticastPkts      The number of received unerrored, multicast
                          frames.

   ifInBroadcastPkts      This variable is not applicable for Frame
                          Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this
                          counter is always zero.

   ifOutMulticastPkts     The number of sent unerrored, multicast
                          frames.

   ifOutBroadcastPkts     This variable is not applicable for Frame
                          Relay Service interfaces, therefore, this
                          counter is always zero.

   ifHCInOctets           Only used for DS3-based (and greater) Frame
                          Relay logical ports.  The number of received
                          octets.  This counter only counts octets
                          from the beginning of the frame relay header
                          field to the end of user data.

   ifHCOutOctets          Only used for DS3-based (and greater) Frame

                          transmitted octets.  This counter only counts
                          octets from the beginning of the frame relay
                          header field to the end of user data.

   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable Set to true(1).  It is recommended that the
                          underlying physical layer notifications be
                          disabled since both are not required.
                          Notifications are enabled at the frame relay
                          service layer specifically because PVC
                          notifications are not to be sent if the frame
                          relay interface fails. Without a
                          linkUp/linkDown notification, the management
                          station would receive no notification of the
                          failure.

   ifHighSpeed            Set to the user data rate of the frame relay
                          logical port in millions of bits per second.
                          If the user data rate is less than 1 Mbps,
                          then this value is zero.

   ifPromiscuousMode      Set to false(2).

   ifConnectorPresent     Set to false(2).

   Frame relay network service interfaces support the Interface Stack
   Group.  Frame relay network service interfaces do not support any
   other groups or objects in the Interfaces group of the IF MIB.

2.5.3.  Stack Table for DS1/E1 Environment

   This section describes by example how to use ifStackTable to
   represent the relationship of frame relay service to ds0 and
   ds0Bundles with ds1 interfaces [20].

   Example: A frame relay service is being carried on 4 ds0s of a ds1.

     +---------------------+
     | Frame Relay Service |
     +---------------------+
                |
     +---------------------+
     | ds0Bundle           |
     +---------------------+
       |     |     |     |
     +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
     |ds0| |ds0| |ds0| |ds0|
     +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
       |     |     |     |
     +---------------------+
     | ds1                 |
     +---------------------+

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

        ifIndex  Description
        1        FrameRelayService (type 44)
        2        ds0Bundle         (type 82)
        3        ds0 #1            (type 81)
        4        ds0 #2            (type 81)
        5        ds0 #3            (type 81)
        6        ds0 #4            (type 81)
        7        ds1               (type 18)

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various interfaces.

        6             7
        7             0

   In the case where the frame relay service is using a single ds0, then
   the ds0Bundle is not required.

     +---------------------+
     | Frame Relay Service |
     +---------------------+
       |

     +---------------------+
     | ds1                 |
     +---------------------+

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

        ifIndex  Description
        1        FrameRelayService (type 44)
        2        ds0               (type 81)
        3        ds1               (type 18)

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various interfaces.

2.5.4.  Stack Table for V.35 Environments

   This section describes by example how to use ifStackTable to
   represent the relationship of frame relay service with V.35
   interfaces.

        +---------------------+
        | Frame Relay Service |
        +---------------------+
                   |
        +---------------------+
        | v35                 |
        +---------------------+

   An example of index values in this case could be:

           ifIndex  Description
           1        FrameRelayService (type 44)
           2        v35               (type 33)

   Note type 33 (RS232-like MIB) is used instead of type 45 (V.35).  V35
   does not pertain to this environment.

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various interfaces.

           ifStackTable Entries

           HigherLayer   LowerLayer
           0             1
           1             2
           2             0

2.5.5.  The Frame Relay/ATM PVC Service Interworking MIB

   Connections between two frame relay endpoints are represented with an
   entry in the frPVCConnectTable of this MIB.  Both endpoints are
   represented with rows in the frPVCEndptTable.  The
   frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object of each endpoint points to the
   frPVCConnectTable cross-connect table row for the connection.



Rehbehn & Fowler            Standards Track                    [Page 14]

RFC 2954                Frame Relay Service MIB             October 2000


   In contrast, a connection that spans frame relay and ATM endpoints is
   represented with an entry in the frAtmIwfConnectionTable of the
   FR/ATM PVC Service Interworking MIB defined in [28].

   In the case of an inter-worked connection, the
   frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier object is set to zero.  Instead, the
   frPVCEndptAtmIwfConnIndex object is set to the index of the FR/ATM
   IWF cross-connect table row.

   The frame relay PVC cross-connect table (frPVCConnectTable) does not
   contain an entry for the FR/ATM inter-worked connection.

2.6.  Textual Convention Change

   Version 1 of the Frame Relay Service MIB contains MIB objects defined
   with the DisplayString textual convention.  In version 2 of this MIB,
   the syntax for these objects has been updated to use the (now
   preferred) SnmpAdminString textual convention.  The new TC provides
   support for a greater variety of international character sets.

   The working group realizes that this change is not strictly supported
   by SMIv2.  In our judgment, the alternative of deprecating the old
   objects and defining new objects would have a more adverse impact on
   backward compatibility and interoperability, given the particular
   semantics of these objects.

                    point, and it also provides statistics for a PVC
                    segment end-point.

                    A PVC segment end-point is identified by a UNI/NNI
                    logical port index value and DLCI index value.

                    If the frame relay service provider allows the
                    frame relay CNM subscriber to create, modify or
                    delete PVCs using SNMP, then this table is used to
                    identify and reserve the requested traffic
                    parameters of each PVC segment end-point.  The
                    Connection table is used to 'connect' the end-
                    points together.  Not all implementations will
                    support the capability of
                    creating/modifying/deleting PVCs using SNMP as a
                    feature of frame relay CNM service.

                    Uni-directional PVCs are modeled with zero valued
                    traffic parameters in one of the directions (In or
                     Out direction) in this table.

                    To create a PVC, the following procedures shall be
                    followed:

                    1)  Create the entries for the PVC segment
                        endpoints in the frPVCEndptTable by specifying
                        the traffic parameters for the bi-directional
                        PVC segment endpoints. As shown in figure 2, a
                        point-to-point PVC has two endpoints, thus two
                        entries in this table.  Uni-directional PVCs
                        are modeled with zero valued traffic
                        parameters in one direction; all the `In'
                        direction parameters for one frame relay PVC
                        End-point or all the `Out' direction
                        parameters for the other frame relay PVC
                        Endpoint.

                    "The Frame Relay PVC Connect Table is used to
                    model the bi-directional PVC segment flows
                    including:  point-to-point PVCs, point-to-
                    multipoint PVCs, and multipoint-to-multipoint
                    PVCs.

                    This table has read-create access and is used to
                    associate PVC end-points together as belonging to
                    one connection.  The frPVCConnectIndex is used to
                    associate all the bi-directional flows.  Not all
                    implementations will support the capability of
                    creating/modifying/deleting PVCs using SNMP as a
                    feature of frame relay CNM service.

                    Once the entries in the frPVCEndptTable are
                    created, the following step are used to associate
                    the PVC end-points as belonging to one PVC
                    connection:

                    1)  Obtain a unique frPVCConnectIndex
                        using the frPVCConnectIndexValue object.

                    2)  Connect the PVC segment endpoints together
                        with the applicable frPVCConnectIndex value
                        obtained via  frPVCConnectIndexValue.  The
                        entries in this table are created by using
                        the frPVCConnectRowStatus object.

                    3)  The agent will provide the value of the
                        corresponding instances of
                        frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier with the
                        frPVCConnectIndex value.

                        all rows for this PVC segment to turn the
                        PVC on.

                    For example, the Frame Relay PVC Connection Group
                    models a bi-directional, point-to-point PVC
                    segment as one entry in this table.

                            |__________________________________|

                    The terms low and high are chosen to represent
                    numerical ordering of a PVC segment's endpoints
                    for representation in this table.  That is, the
                    endpoint with the lower value of ifIndex is termed
                    'low', while the opposite endpoint of the segment
                    is termed 'high'.  This terminology is to provide
                    directional information; for example the
                    frPVCConnectL2hOperStatus and
                    frPVCConnectH2lOperStatus as illustrated above.

                    If the Frame Relay Connection table is used to
                    model a unidirectional PVC, then one direction
                    (either from low to high or from high to low) has
                     its Operational Status equal to down.

                     A PVC segment is a portion of a PVC that traverses
                    one Frame Relay Network, and a PVC segment is
                    identified by its two end-points (UNI/NNI logical
                    port index value and DLCI index value) through one

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information.







Rehbehn & Fowler            Standards Track                    [Page 69]

RFC 2954                Frame Relay Service MIB             October 2000


   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.

APPENDIX A  Update Information

   The changes from RFC 1604 are the following:

   (1)  Added the object frLportDLCIIndexValue to automatically generate
        index values for new DLC rows.

   (2)  Add the following objects to support manager writing to objects:

        Logical Port Objects
            frLportTypeAdmin
            frLportVCSigProtocolAdmin

        VC Objects
            frMgtVCSigProcedAdmin
            frMgtVCSigUserN391Admin

   (3)  Add objects to control fragmentation:

        frLportFragControl frLportFragSize

   (4)  Added objects to track frames offered to network (in) and
        delivered (out) for increased visibility into policing-driven
        discards, congestion-driven discards, DE-bit setting, and
        congestion bit setting:

        frnetservPVCEndptGroup2 -   Extension objects with this
                                    revision of the MIB

        frnetservPVCConnectNamesGroup - New group w/ display names
                                    for connections

        frnetservLportAdminGroup -  New group w/ read-write objects
                                    for the logical port

        frnetservMgtVCSigAdminGroup - New group w/ read-write objects
                                    for the signaling protocol

        frnetservPVCNotifGroup -    Group deprecated to eliminate
                                    obsolete frPVCConnectStatusChange
                                    notification

        frnetservPVCNotifGroup2 -   New group added with w/
                                    frPVCConnectStatusNotif

   (9)  Added UNITS and REFERENCE clauses for objects that needed the
        clarification.

   (10) Changed references to "proxy-agent" to "FRS agent" to avoid
        confusion with other proxy-agent terminology.

   (11) Changed objects using the DisplayString TC to use the
        SnmpAdminString TC.

   (12) frMgtVCSigProced - Expanded to include the u2nuser(3)
        enumeration for the UNI protocol operation where the logical
        port operates in the user role.

   (13) DESCRIPTION text added to specify agent response when object is
        not instantiated  for the following objects:

        frMgtVCSigUserN391
        frMgtVCSigUserN393
        frMgtVCSigUserT391
        frMgtVCSigUserN392
        frMgtVCSigNetN391
        frMgtVCSigNetN393
        frMgtVCSigNetT391
        frMgtVCSigNetN392
        frMgtVCSigNetnN4
        frMgtVCSigNetnT3
        frMgtVCSigUserLinkRelErrors
        frMgtVCSigUserProtErrors
        frMgtVCSigUserChanInactive

   (14) DESCRIPTION text addressing case of logical port not performing
        network-side procedures was removed from following objects:

        frMgtVCSigNetLinkRelErrors
        frMgtVCSigNetChanInactive
        frMgtVCSigNetProtErrors

   (15) frPVCEndptConnectIdentifier - Operation described for the case
        of FR/ATM IWF cross-connect operation.

   (16) frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus - Added description of enumerated
        values.

   (17) frPVCEndptInDiscards - Clarified DESCRIPTION to state that
        congestion discards are not counted by object.

   (18) frPVCConnect{Low|High}IfIndex - Changed to use InterfaceIndex TC
        and changed reference to MIB-II to the new IF-MIB.  Removed
        statement asserting that a zero value means the port is not a FR
        logical port.

   (19) frPVCConnectIndex - Added a range to the SYNTAX clause

   (20) frPVCConnect{L2h|H2l}OperStatus - Added DESCRIPTION text for
        each enumerated value.

   (21) frAccountPVCDLCIIndex - Added a range to the SYNTAX clause

   (22) frPVCCOnnectStatusChange Notification - STATUS change to
        deprecated.  Obsoleted to eliminate inappropriate inclusion of
        index objects

   (23) frPVCConnectStatusNotif Notification - Replaces
        frPVCConnectStatusChange.  In addition, the notification now
        requires 2 instances of the frPVCEndptRcvdSigStatus object, one
        for each endpoint of the connection.

   (24) Guidance added to recommend ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable be set on.

   (25) Behavior of the PVC status and endpoint signaling status is
        clarified for the case of underlying layer failure.

   (26) Overview text re-written for clarity.

   (27) Clarified role of system group.

   (28) Established maximum frame size of 4096 and default value of
        1600.

   (29) Clarified that DLC index range is restricted to valid range for
        the specific length of address field used on the logical port.

   (30) Figure 1 and accompanying text was removed to eliminate a
        confusing "MIB stack" concept.  See the section titled "Relation
        to Other MIBs" for replacement text.
