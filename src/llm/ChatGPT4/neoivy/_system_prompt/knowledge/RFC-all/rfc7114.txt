         Creation of a Registry for smime-type Parameter Values

Abstract

   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) defined the
   Content-Type parameter "smime-type".  As the list of defined values
   for that parameter has increased, it has become clear that a registry
   is needed to document these values.  This document creates the
   registry, registers the current values, and specifies the policies
   for registration of new values.

1.  Introduction

   Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) defined the
   Content-Type "application/pkcs7-mime" and the parameter "smime-type",
   along with four valid values for the parameter [RFC3851].
   Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) added two new parameter values
   [RFC5273].  [RFC5751] replaced RFC 3851 and registered the
   application/pkcs7-mime media type, but did not create a registry for
   the smime-type values.

   Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME [RFC2634] and Securing X.400
   Content with S/MIME [RFC3854] also add smime-type values.

   When Enrollment over Secure Transport [RFC7030] added another
   parameter value, it became clear that a registry for smime-type
   parameter values is necessary.  Section 2 creates this registry,
   registers the current values that are defined in previously published
   documents, and specifies the policies for registration of new values.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has changed the reference field for the media type application/
   pkcs7-mime to refer to [RFC5751] and this document.  This document
   replaces the references to RFC 5273 and RFC 7030, which are no longer
   needed.

   IANA has created a new sub-registry under the "MIME Media Type Sub-
   Parameter Registries" top-level registry.  The new registry is
   "Parameter Values for the smime-type Parameter", and it references
   this document and [RFC5751].  The initial values for the registry are
   as follows:

      +----------------------+-----------------------------------+
      |  smime-type value    |  Reference                        |
      +----------------------+-----------------------------------+
      | certs-only           | [RFC5751], Section 3.2.2          |
      | CMC-Request          | [RFC5273], Section 3              |
      | CMC-Response         | [RFC5273], Section 3              |
      | compressed-data      | [RFC5751], Section 3.2.2          |
      | enveloped-data       | [RFC5751], Section 3.2.2          |
      | enveloped-x400       | [RFC3854], Section 3.3.1          |
      | server-generated-key | [RFC7030], Section 4.4.2          |
      | signed-data          | [RFC5751], Section 3.2.2          |
      | signed-receipt       | [RFC2634], Section 2.4, bullet 10 |
      | signed-x400          | [RFC3854], Section 3.2.1          |
      +----------------------+-----------------------------------+

   New values can be registered using the Specification Required policy,
   as defined in [RFC5226].  The S/MIME Message Specification [RFC5751],
   Section 3.2.2, specifies guidelines for assigning new smime-type
   parameter values, and those guidelines apply to the assignment of
   values in this registry.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document is purely administrative and presents no security
   issues.
