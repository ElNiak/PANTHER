1.  Abstract

   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
   network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
   particular, it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels of
   any type over IPv4 networks.  Extension MIBs may be designed for
   managing protocol-specific objects. Likewise, extension MIBs may be
   designed for managing security-specific objects.  This MIB does not
   support tunnels over non-IPv4 networks (including IPv6 networks).
   Management of such tunnels may be supported by other MIBs.

RFC 2667                     IP Tunnel MIB                   August 1999


2.  Introduction

   Over the past several years, there have been a number of "tunneling"
   protocols specified by the IETF (see [28] for an early discussion of
   the model and examples).  This document describes a Management
   Information Base (MIB) used for managing tunnels of any type over
   IPv4 networks, including GRE [16,17], IP-in-IP [18], Minimal
   Encapsulation [19], L2TP [20], PPTP [21], L2F [25], UDP (e.g., [26]),
   ATMP [22], and IPv6-in-IPv4 [27] tunnels.

   Extension MIBs may be designed for managing protocol-specific
   objects.  Likewise, extension MIBs may be designed for managing
   security-specific objects (e.g., IPSEC [24]), and traffic conditioner
   [29] objects.  Finally, this MIB does not support tunnels over non-
   IPv4 networks (including IPv6 networks).  Management of such tunnels
   may be supported by other MIBs.

3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
        [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and
        RFC 2574 [12].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

RFC 2667                     IP Tunnel MIB                   August 1999


   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

4.  Overview

   This MIB module contains two tables:

   o    the Tunnel Interface Table, containing information on the
        tunnels known to a router; and

   o    the Tunnel Config Table, which can be used for dynamic creation
        of tunnels, and also provides a mapping from endpoint addresses
        to the current interface index value.

4.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

   This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB to the Interfaces
   MIB [23].  Several areas of correlation are addressed in the
   following subsections.  The implementor is referred to the Interfaces
   MIB document in order to understand the general intent of these
   areas.

4.1.1.  Layering Model

   Each logical interface (physical or virtual) has an ifEntry in the
   Interfaces MIB [23].  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical
   interface (ifEntry) for each tunnel. These are then correlated, using
   the ifStack table of the Interfaces MIB, to those interfaces on which
   the local IPv4 addresses of the tunnels are configured.  The basic
   model, therefore, looks something like this (for example):

      |       Physical interface       |     by ifStack table
      +--------------------------------+

4.1.2.  ifRcvAddressTable

   The ifRcvAddressTable usage is defined in the MIBs defining the
   encapsulation below the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP
   encapsulation is being used, the ifRcvAddressTable is defined by IP-
   in-IP.

4.1.3.  ifEntry

   IfEntries are defined in the MIBs defining the encapsulation below
   the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP encapsulation [20] is
   being used, the ifEntry is defined by IP-in-IP.

   The ifType of a tunnel should be set to "tunnel" (131).  An entry in
   the IP Tunnel MIB will exist for every ifEntry with this ifType.  An
   implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB may allow ifEntries to be created
   via the tunnelConfigTable.  Creating a tunnel will also add an entry
   in the ifTable and in the tunnelIfTable, and deleting a tunnel will
   likewise delete the entry in the ifTable and the tunnelIfTable.

   The use of two different tables in this MIB was an important design
   decision.  Traditionally, ifIndex values are chosen by agents, and
   are permitted to change across restarts.  Allowing row creation
   directly in the Tunnel Interface Table, indexed by ifIndex, would
   complicate row creation and/or cause interoperability problems (if
   each agent had special restrictions on ifIndex). Instead, a separate
   table is used which is indexed only by objects over which the manager
   has control.  Namely, these are the addresses of the tunnel endpoints
   and the encapsulation protocol.  Finally, an additional manager-
   chosen ID is used in the index to support protocols such as L2F which
   allow multiple tunnels between the same endpoints.

            which does not support multiple parallel tunnels with the
            same endpoints, the management station should simply use a
            tunnelConfigID of 1, and set tunnelConfigStatus to
            createAndGo.  For encapsulation methods such as L2F which
            allow multiple parallel tunnels, the management station may
            select a pseudo-random number to use as the tunnelConfigID
            and set tunnelConfigStatus to createAndGo.  In the event
            that this ID is already in use and an inconsistentValue is
            returned in response to the set operation, the management
            station should simply select a new pseudo-random number and
            retry the operation.

            Creating a row in this table will cause an interface index
            to be assigned by the agent in an implementation-dependent
            manner, and corresponding rows will be instantiated in the
            ifTable and the tunnelIfTable.  The status of this row will
            become active as soon as the agent assigns the interface
            index, regardless of whether the interface is operationally
            up.

6.  Security Considerations

   This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
   related to IP tunnel interfaces.  There are also a number of objects
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create, such
   as those which allow an administrator to dynamically configure
   tunnels.

   While unauthorized access to the readable objects is relatively
   innocuous, unauthorized access to the write-able objects could cause
   a denial of service, or could cause unauthorized creation and/or
   manipulation of tunnels. Hence, the support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec [24]), even
   then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have
   legitimate rights to access them.
