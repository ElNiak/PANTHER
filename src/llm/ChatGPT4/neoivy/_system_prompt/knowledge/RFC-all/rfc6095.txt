               Extending YANG with Language Abstractions

Abstract

   YANG -- the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Data Modeling
   Language -- supports modeling of a tree of data elements that
   represent the configuration and runtime status of a particular
   network element managed via NETCONF.  This memo suggests enhancing
   YANG with supplementary modeling features and language abstractions
   with the aim to improve the model extensibility and reuse.

1.  Introduction

   YANG -- the NETCONF Data Modeling Language [RFC6020] -- supports
   modeling of a tree of data elements that represent the configuration
   and runtime status of a particular network element managed via
   NETCONF.  This document defines extensions for the modeling language
   YANG as new language statements, which introduce language
   abstractions to improve the model extensibility and reuse.  The
   document reports from modeling experience in the telecommunication
   industry and gives model examples from an actual network management
   system to highlight the value of proposed language extensions,
   especially class inheritance and recursiveness.  The language
   extensions defined in this document have been implemented with two
   open source tools.  These tools have been used to validate the model
   examples through the document.  If this experimental specification
   results in successful usage, it is possible that the language
   extensions defined herein could be updated to incorporate
   implementation and deployment experience, then pursued on the
   Standards Track, possibly as part of a future version of YANG.

1.1.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, [RFC2119].

1.2.  Motivation

   Following are non-exhaustive motivation examples highlighting usage
   scenarios for language abstractions.

   o  Many systems today have a Management Information Base (MIB) that
      in effect is organized as a tree build of recursively nested
      container nodes.  For example, the physical resources in the
      ENTITY-MIB conceptually form a containment tree.  The index

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


      entPhysicalContainedIn points to the containing entity in a flat
      list.  The ability to represent nested, recursive data structures
      of arbitrary depth would enable the representation of the primary
      containment hierarchy of physical entities as a node tree in the
      server MIB and in the NETCONF payload.

   o  A manager scanning the network in order to update the state of an
      inventory management system might be only interested in data
      structures that represent a specific type of hardware.  Such a
      manager would then look for entities that are of this specific
      type, including those that are an extension or specialization of
      this type.  To support this use case, it is helpful to bear the
      corresponding type information within the data structures, which
      describe the network element hardware.

   o  A system that is managing network elements is concerned, e.g.,
      with managed objects of type "plug-in modules" that have a name, a
      version, and an activation state.  In this context, it is useful
      to define the "plug-in module" as a concept that is supposed to be
      further detailed and extended by additional concrete model
      elements.  In order to realize such a system, it is worthwhile to
      model abstract entities, which enable reuse and ease concrete
      refinements of that abstract entity in a second step.

   o  As particular network elements have specific types of components
      that need to be managed (OS images, plug-in modules, equipment,
      etc.), it should be possible to define concrete types, which
      describe the managed object precisely.  By using type-safe
      extensions of basic concepts, a system in the manager role can
      safely and explicitly determine that e.g., the "equipment" is
      actually of type "network card".

   o  Currently, different SDOs are working on the harmonization of
      their management information models.  Often, a model mapping or
      transformation between systems becomes necessary.  The
      harmonization of the models is done e.g., by mapping of the two
      models on the object level or integrating an object hierarchy into
      an existing information model.  On the one hand, extending YANG
      with language abstractions can simplify the adoption of IETF
      resource models by other SDOs and facilitate the alignment with
      other SDOs' resource models (e.g., TM Forum SID [SID_V8]).  On the
      other hand, the proposed YANG extensions can enable the
      utilization of the YANG modeling language in other SDOs, which
      usually model complex management systems in a top-down manner and
      use high-level language features frequently.

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


   This memo specifies additional modeling features for the YANG
   language in the area of structured model abstractions, typed
   references, as well as recursive data structures, and it discusses
   how these new features can improve the modeling capabilities of YANG.

   Section 1.5.1 contains a physical resource model that deals with some
   of the modeling challenges illustrated above.  Section 1.5.2 gives an
   example that uses the base classes defined in the physical resource
   model and derives a model for physical entities defined in the Entity
   MIB.

1.3.  Modeling Improvements with Language Abstractions

   As an enhancement to YANG 1.0, complex types and typed instance
   identifiers provide different technical improvements on the modeling
   level:

   o  In case the model of a system that should be managed with NETCONF
      makes use of inheritance, complex types enable an almost one-to-
      one mapping between the classes in the original model and the YANG
      module.

   o  Typed instance identifiers allow representing associations between
      the concepts in a type-safe way to prevent type errors caused by
      referring to data nodes of incompatible types.  This avoids
      referring to a particular location in the MIB.  Referring to a
      particular location in the MIB is not mandated by the domain
      model.

   o  Complex types allow defining complete, self-contained type
      definitions.  It is not necessary to explicitly add a key
      statement to lists, which use a grouping that defines the data
      nodes.

   o  Complex types simplify concept refinement by extending a base
      complex type and make it superfluous to represent concept
      refinements with workarounds such as huge choice-statements with
      complex branches.

   o  Abstract complex types ensure correct usage of abstract concepts
      by enforcing the refinement of a common set of properties before
      instantiation.

   o  Complex types allow defining recursive structures.  This enables
      representing complex structures of arbitrary depth by nesting
      instances of basic complex types that may contain themselves.





Linowski, et al.              Experimental                      [Page 5]

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


   o  Complex types avoid introducing metadata types (e.g., type code
      enumerations) and metadata leafs (e.g., leafs containing a type
      code) to indicate which concrete type of object is actually
      represented by a generic container in the MIB.  This also avoids
      explicitly ruling out illegal use of subtype-specific properties
      in generic containers.

   o  Complex type instances include the type information in the NETCONF
      payload.  This allows determining the actual type of an instance
      during the NETCONF payload parsing and avoids the use in the model
      of additional leafs, which provide the type information as
      content.

   o  Complex types may be declared explicitly as optional features,
      which is not possible when the actual type of an entity
      represented by a generic container is indicated with a type code
      enumeration.

   Appendix B, "Example YANG Module for the IPFIX/PSAMP Model", lists
   technical improvements for modeling with complex types and typed
   instance identifiers and exemplifies the usage of the proposed YANG
   extensions based on the IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX) / Packet
   Sampling (PSAMP) configuration model in [IPFIXCONF].

1.4.  Design Approach

   The proposed additional features for YANG in this memo are designed
   to reuse existing YANG statements whenever possible.  Additional
   semantics is expressed by an extension that is supposed to be used as
   a substatement of an existing statement.

   The proposed features don't change the semantics of models that is
   valid with respect to the YANG specification [RFC6020].

1.5.  Modeling Resource Models with YANG

1.5.1.  Example of a Physical Network Resource Model

   The diagram below depicts a portion of an information model for
   manageable network resources used in an actual network management
   system.

   Note: The referenced model (UDM, Unified Data Model) is based on key
   resource modeling concepts from [SID_V8] and is compliant with
   selected parts of SID Resource Abstract Business Entities domain
   [UDM].

   The class diagram in Figure 1 and the corresponding YANG module
   excerpt focus on basic resource ("Resource" and the distinction
   between logical and physical resources) and hardware abstractions
   ("Hardware", "Equipment", and "EquipmentHolder").  Class attributes
   were omitted to achieve decent readability.

   Since this model is an abstraction of network-element-specific MIB
   topologies, modeling it with YANG creates some challenges.  Some of
   these challenges and how they can be addressed with complex types are
   explained below:

   o  Modeling of abstract concepts: Classes like "Resource" represent
      concepts that primarily serve as a base class for derived classes.
      With complex types, such an abstract concept could be represented
      by an abstract complex type (see "complex-type extension
      statement" and "abstract extension statement").

   o  Class Inheritance: Information models for complex management
      domains often use class inheritance to create specialized classes
      like "PhysicalConnector" from a more generic base class (here,
      "Hardware"), which itself might inherit from another base class
      ("PhysicalResource"), etc.  Complex types allow creating enhanced
      versions of an existing (abstract or concrete) base type via an
      extension (see "extends extension statement").

   o  Recursive containment: In order to specify containment
      hierarchies, models frequently contain different aggregation
      associations, in which the target (contained element) is either
      the containing class itself or a base class of the containing
      class.  In the model above, the recursive containment of
      "EquipmentHolder" is an example of such a relationship (see the
      description for the "complex-type EquipmentHolder" in the example
      model "udmcore" below).

   o  Complex types support such a containment by using a complex type
      (or one of its ancestor types) as the type of an instance or
      instance list that is part of its definition (see "instance(-list)
      extension statement").

   o  Reference relationships: A key requirement on large models for
      network domains with many related managed objects is the ability
      to define inter-class associations that represent essential
      relationships between instances of such a class.  For example, the
      relationship between "PhysicalLink" and "Hardware" tells which
      physical link is connecting which hardware resources.  It is
      important to notice that this kind of relationship does not
      mandate any particular location of the two connected hardware
      instances in any MIB module.  Such containment-agnostic
      relationships can be represented by a typed instance identifier
      that embodies one direction of such an association (see Section 3,
      "Typed Instance Identifier").

1.5.2.  Modeling Entity MIB Entries as Physical Resources

   The physical resource module described above can now be used to model
   physical entities as defined in the Entity MIB [RFC4133].  For each
   physical entity class listed in the "PhysicalClass" enumeration, a
   complex type is defined.  Each of these complex types extends the
   most specific complex type already available in the physical resource
   module.  For example, the type "HWModule" extends the complex type
   "Equipment" as a hardware module.  Physical entity properties that
   should be included in a physical entity complex type are combined in
   a grouping, which is then used in each complex type definition of an
   entity.

   This approach has following benefits:

   o  The definition of the complex types for hardware entities becomes
      compact as many of the features can be reused from the basic
      complex type definition.

   o  Physical entities are modeled in a consistent manner as predefined
      concepts are extended.

   o  Entity-MIB-specific attributes as well as vendor-specific
      attributes can be added without having to define separate
      extension data nodes.

2.  Complex Types

2.1.  Definition

   YANG type concept is currently restricted to simple types, e.g.,
   restrictions of primitive types, enumerations, or union of simple
   types.

   Complex types are types with a rich internal structure, which may be
   composed of substatements defined in Table 1 (e.g., lists, leafs,
   containers, choices).  A new complex type may extend an existing
   complex type.  This allows providing type-safe extensions to existing
   YANG models as instances of the new type.

   Complex types have the following characteristics:

   o  Introduction of new types, as a named, formal description of a
      concrete manageable resource as well as abstract concepts.

   o  Types can be extended, i.e., new types can be defined by
      specializing existing types and adding new features.  Instances of
      such an extended type can be used wherever instances of the base
      type may appear.

   o  The type information is made part of the NETCONF payload in case a
      derived type substitutes a base type.  This enables easy and
      efficient consumption of payload elements representing complex
      type instances.

2.2.  complex-type Extension Statement

   The extension statement "complex-type" is introduced; it accepts an
   arbitrary number of statements that define node trees, among other
   common YANG statements ("YANG Statements", Section 7 of [RFC6020]).

                   Table 1: complex-type's Substatements

   Complex type definitions may appear at every place where a grouping
   may be defined.  That includes the module, submodule, rpc, input,
   output, notification, container, and list statements.

   Complex type names populate a distinct namespace.  As with YANG
   groupings, it is possible to define a complex type and a data node
   (e.g., leaf, list, instance statements) with the same name in the
   same scope.  All complex type names defined within a parent node or
   at the top level of the module or its submodules share the same type
   identifier namespace.  This namespace is scoped to the parent node or
   module.

   A complex type MAY have an instance key.  An instance key is either
   defined with the "key" statement as part of the complex type or is
   inherited from the base complex type.  It is not allowed to define an
   additional key if the base complex type or one of its ancestors
   already defines a key.

   Complex type definitions do not create nodes in the schema tree.

2.3.  instance Extension Statement

   The "instance" extension statement is used to instantiate a complex
   type by creating a subtree in the management information node tree.
   The instance statement takes one argument that is the identifier of
   the complex type instance.  It is followed by a block of
   substatements.

   The type of the instance is specified with the mandatory "ct:
   instance-type" substatement.  The type of an instance MUST be a
   complex type.  Common YANG statements may be used as substatements of
   the "instance" statement.  An instance is optional by default.  To
   make an instance mandatory, "mandatory true" has to be applied as a
   substatement.

                     Table 2: instance's Substatements

   The "instance" and "instance-list" extension statements (see
   Section 2.4, "instance-list Extension Statement") are similar to the
   existing "leaf" and "leaf-list" statements, with the exception that
   the content is composed of subordinate elements according to the
   instantiated complex type.

   It is also possible to add additional data nodes by using the
   corresponding leaf, leaf-list, list, and choice-statements, etc., as
   substatements of the instance declaration.  This is an in-place

   augmentation of the used complex type confined to a complex type
   instantiation (see also Section 2.13, "Using Complex Types", for
   details on augmenting complex types).

2.4.  instance-list Extension Statement

   The "instance-list" extension statement is used to instantiate a
   complex type by defining a sequence of subtrees in the management
   information node tree.  In addition, the "instance-list" statement
   takes one argument that is the identifier of the complex type
   instances.  It is followed by a block of substatements.

   The type of the instance is specified with the mandatory "ct:
   instance-type" substatement.  In addition, it can be defined how
   often an instance may appear in the schema tree by using the "min-
   elements" and "max-elements" substatements.  Common YANG statements
   may be used as substatements of the "instance-list" statement.

   In analogy to the "instance" statement, YANG substatements like
   "list", "choice", "leaf", etc., MAY be used to augment the "instance-
   list" elements at the root level with additional data nodes.

   In case the instance list represents configuration data, the used
   complex type of an instance MUST have an instance key.

   Instances as well as instance lists may appear as arguments of the
   "deviate" statement.

2.5.  extends Extension Statement

   A complex type MAY extend exactly one existing base complex type by
   using the "extends" extension statement.  The keyword "extends" MAY
   occur as a substatement of the "complex-type" extension statement.
   The argument of the "complex-type" extension statement refers to the
   base complex type via its name.  In case a complex type represents
   configuration data (the default), it MUST have a key; otherwise, it
   MAY have a key.  A key is either defined with the "key" statement as
   part of the complex type or is inherited from the base complex type.

                      +--------------+-------------+
                      | substatement | cardinality |
                      +--------------+-------------+
                      |  description |     0..1    |
                      |   reference  |     0..1    |
                      |    status    |     0..1    |
                      +--------------+-------------+

                      Table 4: extends' Substatements

2.6.  abstract Extension Statement

   Complex types may be declared to be abstract by using the "abstract"
   extension statement.  An abstract complex type cannot be
   instantiated, meaning it cannot appear as the most specific type of
   an instance in the NETCONF payload.  In case an abstract type extends
   a base type, the base complex type MUST be also abstract.  By
   default, complex types are not abstract.

   The abstract complex type serves only as a base type for derived
   concrete complex types and cannot be used as a type for an instance
   in the NETCONF payload.

   The "abstract" extension statement takes a single string argument,
   which is either "true" or "false".  In case a "complex-type"
   statement does not contain an "abstract" statement as a substatement,
   the default is "false".  The "abstract" statement does not support
   any substatements.

2.7.  XML Encoding Rules

   An "instance" node is encoded as an XML element, where an "instance-
   list" node is encoded as a series of XML elements.  The corresponding
   XML element names are the "instance" and "instance-list" identifiers,
   respectively, and they use the same XML namespace as the module.

   Instance child nodes are encoded as subelements of the instance XML
   element.  Subelements representing child nodes defined in the same
   complex type may appear in any order.  However, child nodes of an
   extending complex type follow the child nodes of the extended complex
   type.  As such, the XML encoding of lists is similar to the encoding
   of containers and lists in YANG.

   Instance key nodes are encoded as subelements of the instance XML
   element.  Instance key nodes must appear in the same order as they
   are defined within the "key" statement of the corresponding complex
   type definition and precede all other nodes defined in the same
   complex type.  That is, if key nodes are defined in an extending
   complex type, XML elements representing key data precede all other
   XML elements representing child nodes.  On the other hand, XML
   elements representing key data follow the XML elements representing
   data nodes of the base type.

   The type of the actual complex type instance is encoded in a type
   element, which is put in front of all instance child elements,
   including key nodes, as described in Section 2.8 ("Type Encoding
   Rules").

   The proposed XML encoding rules conform to the YANG XML encoding
   rules in [RFC6020].  Compared to YANG, enabling key definitions in
   derived hierarchies is a new feature introduced with the complex
   types extension.  As a new language feature, complex types also
   introduce a new payload entry for the instance type identifier.

   Based on our implementation experience, the proposed XML encoding
   rules support consistent mapping of YANG models with complex types to
   an XML schema using XML complex types.

2.8.  Type Encoding Rules

   In order to encode the type of an instance in the NETCONF payload,
   XML elements named "type" belonging to the XML namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-type-instance" are added to
   the serialized form of instance and instance-list nodes in the
   payload.  The suggested namespace prefix is "cti".  The "cti:type"
   XML elements are inserted before the serialized form of all members
   that have been declared in the corresponding complex type definition.



Linowski, et al.              Experimental                     [Page 20]

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


   The "cti:type" element is inserted for each type in the extension
   chain to the actual type of the instance (most specific last).  Each
   type name includes its corresponding namespace.

   The type of a complex type instance MUST be encoded in the reply to
   NETCONF <get> and <get-config> operations, and in the payload of a
   NETCONF <edit-config> operation if the operation is "create" or
   "replace".  The type of the instance MUST also be specified in case
   <copy-config> is used to export a configuration to a resource
   addressed with an URI.  The type of the instance has to be specified
   in user-defined remote procedure calls (RPCs).

   The type of the instance MAY be specified in case the operation is
   "merge" (either because this is explicitly specified or no operation
   attribute is provided).

   In case the node already exists in the target configuration and the
   type attribute (type of a complex type instance) is specified but
   differs from the data in the target, an <rpc-error> element is
   returned with an <error-app-tag> value of "wrong-complex-type".  In
   case no such element is present in the target configuration but the
   type attribute is missing in the configuration data, an <rpc-error>
   element is returned with an <error-tag> value of "missing-attribute".

   The type MUST NOT be specified in case the operation is "delete".

2.9.  Extension and Feature Definition Module

   The module below contains all YANG extension definitions for complex
   types and typed instance identifiers.  In addition, a "complex-type"
   feature is defined, which may be used to provide conditional or
   alternative modeling, depending on the support status of complex
   types in a NETCONF server.  A NETCONF server that supports the
   modeling features for complex types and the XML encoding for complex
   types as defined in this document MUST advertise this as a feature.
   This is done by including the feature name "complex-types" in the
   feature parameter list as part of the NETCONF <hello> message as
   described in Section 5.6.4 in [RFC6020].

2.10.  Example Model for Complex Types

   represent physical equipment in a vendor-independent, abstract way.
   It reuses the complex types defined in the physical resource model in
   Section 1.5.1.

2.11.  NETCONF Payload Example

   Following example shows the payload of a reply to a NETCONF <get>
   command.  The actual type of managed hardware instances is indicated
   with the "cti:type" elements as required by the type encoding rules.
   The containment hierarchy in the NETCONF XML payload reflects the
   containment hierarchy of hardware instances.  This makes filtering
   based on the containment hierarchy possible without having to deal
   with values of leafs of type leafref that represent the tree
   structure in a flattened hierarchy.

2.12.  Update Rules for Modules Using Complex Types

   In addition to the module update rules specified in Section 10 in
   [RFC6020], modules that define complex types, instances of complex
   types, and typed instance identifiers must obey following rules:

   o  New complex types MAY be added.

   o  A new complex type MAY extend an existing complex type.

   o  New data definition statements MAY be added to a complex type only
      if:

      *  they are not mandatory or

      *  they are not conditionally dependent on a new feature (i.e.,
         they do not have an "if-feature" statement that refers to a new
         feature).

   o  The type referred to by the instance-type statement may be changed
      to a type that derives from the original type only if the original
      type does not represent configuration data.

2.13.  Using Complex Types

   All data nodes defined inside a complex type reside in the complex
   type namespace, which is their parent node namespace.

2.13.1.  Overriding Complex Type Data Nodes

   It is not allowed to override a data node inherited from a base type.
   That is, it is an error if a type "base" with a leaf named "foo" is
   extended by another complex type ("derived") with a leaf named "foo"
   in the same module.  In case they are derived in different modules,
   there are two distinct "foo" nodes that are mapped to the XML
   namespaces of the module, where the complex types are specified.





Linowski, et al.              Experimental                     [Page 26]

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


   A complex type that extends a basic complex type may use the "refine"
   statement in order to improve an inherited data node.  The target
   node identifier must be qualified by the module prefix to indicate
   clearly which inherited node is refined.

   The following refinements can be done:

   o  A leaf or choice node may have a default value, or a new default
      value if it already had one.

   o  Any node may have a different "description" or "reference" string.

   o  A leaf, anyxml, or choice node may have a "mandatory true"
      statement.  However, it is not allowed to change from "mandatory
      true" to "mandatory false".

   o  A leaf, leaf-list, list, container, or anyxml node may have
      additional "must" expressions.

   o  A list, leaf-list, instance, or instance-list node may have a
      "min-elements" statement, if the base type does not have one or
      does not have one with a value that is greater than the minimum
      value of the base type.

   o  A list, leaf-list, instance, or instance-list node may have a
      "max-elements" statement, if the base type does not have one or
      does not have one with a value that is smaller than the maximum
      value of the base type.

   It is not allowed to refine complex-type nodes inside "instance" or
   "instance-list" statements.

2.13.2.  Augmenting Complex Types

   Augmenting complex types is only allowed if a complex type is
   instantiated in an "instance" or "instance-list" statement.  This
   confines the effect of the augmentation to the location in the schema
   tree where the augmentation is done.  The argument of the "augment"
   statement MUST be in the descendant form (as defined by the rule
   "descendant-schema-nodeid" in Section 12 in [RFC6020]).











Linowski, et al.              Experimental                     [Page 27]

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


      ct:complex-type Chassis {
              ct:extends EquipmentHolder;
              container chassisInfo {
                     config false;
                     leaf numberOfSlots { type uint16; }
                     leaf occupiedSlots { type uint16; }
                     leaf height {type unit16;}
                     leaf width {type unit16;}
                }
      }

      ct:instance-list chassis {
              type Chassis;
              augment "chassisInfo" {
                     leaf modelId { type string; }
              }
      }

   When augmenting a complex type, only the "container", "leaf", "list",
   "leaf-list", "choice", "instance", "instance-list", and "if-feature"
   statements may be used within the "augment" statement.  The nodes
   added by the augmentation MUST NOT be mandatory nodes.  One or many
   "augment" statements may not cause the creation of multiple nodes
   with the same name from the same namespace in the target node.

   To achieve less-complex modeling, this document proposes the
   augmentation of complex type instances without recursion.

2.13.3.  Controlling the Use of Complex Types

   A server might not want to support all complex types defined in a
   supported module.  This issue can be addressed with YANG features as
   follows:

   o  Features are defined that are used inside complex type definitions
      (by using "if-feature" as a substatement) to make them optional.
      In this case, such complex types may only be instantiated if the
      feature is supported (advertised as a capability in the NETCONF
      <hello> message).

   o  The "deviation" statement may be applied to node trees, which are
      created by "instance" and "instance-list" statements.  In this
      case, only the substatement "deviate not-supported" is allowed.








Linowski, et al.              Experimental                     [Page 28]

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


   o  It is not allowed to apply the "deviation" statement to node tree
      elements that may occur because of the recursive use of a complex
      type.  Other forms of deviations ("deviate add", "deviate
      replace", "deviate delete") are NOT supported inside node trees
      spanned by "instance" or "instance-list".

   As complex type definitions do not contribute by themselves to the
   data node tree, data node declarations inside complex types cannot be
   the target of deviations.

   In the example below, client applications are informed that the leaf
   "occupiedSlots" is not supported in the top-level chassis.  However,
   if a chassis contains another chassis, the contained chassis may
   support the leaf that reports the number of occupied slots.

     deviation "/chassis/chassisSpec/occupiedSlots" {
        deviate not-supported;
     }

3.  Typed Instance Identifier

3.1.  Definition

   Typed instance identifier relationships are an addition to the
   relationship types already defined in YANG, where the leafref
   relationship is location dependent, and the instance-identifier does
   not specify to which type of instances the identifier points.

   A typed instance identifier represents a reference to an instance of
   a complex type without being restricted to a particular location in
   the containment tree.  This is done by using the extension statement
   "instance-type" as a substatement of the existing "type instance
   identifier" statement.

   Typed instance identifiers allow referring to instances of complex
   types that may be located anywhere in the schema tree.  The "type"
   statement plays the role of a restriction that must be fulfilled by
   the target node, which is referred to with the instance identifier.
   The target node MUST be of a particular complex type, either the type
   itself or any type that extends this complex type.

3.2.  instance-type Extension Statement

   The "instance-type" extension statement specifies the complex type of
   the instance to which the instance-identifier refers.  The referred
   instance may also instantiate any complex type that extends the
   specified complex type.

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


   The instance complex type is identified by the single name argument.
   The referred complex type MUST have a key.  This extension statement
   MUST be used as a substatement of the "type instance-identifier"
   statement.  The "instance-type" extension statement does not support
   any substatements.

3.3.  Typed Instance Identifier Example

   In the example below, a physical link connects an arbitrary number of
   physical ports.  Here, typed instance identifiers are used to denote
   which "PhysicalPort" instances (anywhere in the data tree) are
   connected by a "PhysicalLink".

        // Extended version of type Card
        ct:complex-type Card {
           ct:extends Equipment;
           leaf usedSlot { type uint16; mandatory true; }
           ct:instance-list port {
               type PhysicalPort;
           }
        }

        ct:complex-type PhysicalPort {
           ct:extends ManagedHardware;
           leaf portNumber { type int32; mandatory true; }
        }

        ct:complex-type PhysicalLink {
           ct:extends ManagedHardware;
           leaf media { type string; }
           leaf-list connectedPort {
              type instance-identifier {
                ct:instance-type PhysicalPort;
              }
              min-elements 2;
           }
        }


   Below is the XML encoding of an element named "link" of type
   "PhysicalLink":

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers two URIs in the IETF XML registry.  IANA
   registered the following URIs, according to [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-types
   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-type-instance

   Registrant Contact:
   Bernd Linowski (bernd.linowski.ext@nsn.com)
   Mehmet Ersue (mehmet.ersue@nsn.com)
   Siarhei Kuryla (s.kuryla@gmail.com)

   XML: N/A, the requested URIs are XML namespaces.

   This document registers one module name in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry, defined in [RFC6020].
      name: ietf-complex-types

      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-complex-types

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module "complex-types" in this memo defines YANG extensions
   for complex types and typed instance identifiers as new language
   statements.

   Complex types and typed instance identifiers themselves do not have
   any security impact on the Internet.

   The security considerations described throughout [RFC6020] apply here
   as well.

Appendix B.  Example YANG Module for the IPFIX/PSAMP Model

B.1.  Modeling Improvements for the IPFIX/PSAMP Model with Complex Types
      and Typed Instance Identifiers

   The module below is a variation of the IPFIX/PSAMP configuration
   model, which uses complex types and typed instance identifiers to
   model the concept outlined in [IPFIXCONF].

   When looking at the YANG module with complex types and typed instance
   identifiers, various technical improvements on the modeling level
   become apparent.

   o  There is almost a one-to-one mapping between the domain concepts
      introduced in IPFIX and the complex types in the YANG module.





Linowski, et al.              Experimental                     [Page 40]

RFC 6095               YANG Language Abstractions             March 2011


   o  All associations between the concepts (besides containment) are
      represented with typed identifiers.  That avoids having to refer
      to a particular location in the tree.  Referring to a particular
      in the tree is not mandated by the original model.

   o  It is superfluous to represent concept refinement (class
      inheritance in the original model) with containment in the form of
      quite big choice-statements with complex branches.  Instead,
      concept refinement is realized by complex types extending a base
      complex type.

   o  It is unnecessary to introduce metadata identities and leafs
      (e.g., "identity cacheMode" and "leaf cacheMode" in "grouping
      cacheParameters") that just serve the purpose of indicating which
      concrete subtype of a generic type (modeled as grouping, which
      contains the union of all features of all subtypes) is actually
      represented in the MIB.

   o  Ruling out illegal use of subtype-specific properties (e.g., "leaf
      maxFlows") by using "when" statements that refer to a subtype
      discriminator is not necessary (e.g., when "../cacheMode !=
      'immediate'").

   o  Defining properties like the configuration status wherever a so
      called "parameter grouping" is used is not necessary.  Instead,
      those definitions can be put inside the complex type definition
      itself.

   o  Separating the declaration of the key from the related data nodes
      definitions in a grouping (see use of "grouping
      selectorParameters") can be avoided.

   o  Complex types may be declared as optional features.  If the type
      is indicated with an identity (e.g., "identity immediate"), this
      is not possible, since "if-feature" is not allowed as a
      substatement of "identity".
