RFC 3504                     IOTP v1 Errata                   March 2003


1. Introduction

   The Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP), Version 1.0, is specified
   in [RFC 2801, 2802, 2803].  It provides a payment system independent
   framework for Internet commerce oriented to consumer to business
   transactions.  It provides mechanism for different portions of the
   business function, such as fulfillment or payment handling, to be
   distributed or outsourced.  It does not require a prior relationship
   between the consumer and business.

   Several errors have been noted in the IOTP v1.0 specification,
   particularly RFC 2801, which was the largest RFC ever issued.  These
   are listed, with their fix, in this document.

2. DTD Errata

2.1 PackagedContent Element

   Attribute types are swapped.

   OLD/INCORRECT:
      !ELEMENT PackagedContent (#PCDATA) >
      <!ATTLIST PackagedContent
               Name             CDATA     #IMPLIED
               Content          NMTOKEN   "PCDATA"
               Transform   (NONE|BASE64)  "NONE" >

   NEW/CORRECT:
      <!ELEMENT PackagedContent (#PCDATA) >
      <!ATTLIST PackagedContent
                Name           NMTOKEN     #IMPLIED
                Content        CDATA       "PCDATA"
                Transform   (NONE|BASE64)  "NONE" >

RFC 3504                     IOTP v1 Errata                   March 2003


2.2 The Element called Attribute

   Incorrect element content specification syntax.

   OLD/INCORRECT:
      <!ELEMENT Attribute ( ANY ) >
      <!ATTLIST Attribute
                type                NMTOKEN            #REQUIRED
                critical        ( true | false )       #REQUIRED
      >

   NEW/CORRECT
      <!ELEMENT Attribute ANY >
      <!ATTLIST Attribute
                type                NMTOKEN            #REQUIRED
                critical        ( true | false )       #REQUIRED
      >

3. Other Errata

3.1 Re: Combining Authentication Transactions with other Transactions

   Section 9.1.13. page 234, restarted->continued:

   OLD/INCORRECT:
      if the Authentication transaction is successful, then the original
      IOTP Transaction is restarted

   NEW/CORRECT:
      if the Authentication transaction is successful, then the original
      IOTP Transaction is continued

3.2 Type attribute of Element called Attribute

      Section 7.19.1, Page 150, insufficient list of signature types:

   OLD/INCORRECT:
      There must be one and only one Attribute Element that contains a
      Type attribute with a value of IOTP Signature Type and with
      content set to either: OfferResponse, PaymentResponse,
      DeliveryResponse, AuthenticationRequest, AuthenticationResponse,
      PingReq or PingResponse; depending on the type of the signature.

RFC 3504                     IOTP v1 Errata                   March 2003


   NEW/CORRECT:
      There must be one and only one Attribute Element that contains a
      Type attribute with a value of IOTP Signature Type and with
      content set to either: OfferResponse, PaymentResponse,
      DeliveryResponse, AuthenticationRequest, AuthenticationResponse,
      PingReq, PingResponse, AuthenticationStatus, InquiryRequest, or
      InquiryResponse; depending on the type of the signature.

   AND a similar change extending the list of values in Section 12.1,
   Page 262.

   And at Section 6.1.2, Page 82, add the following:

      AuthenticationStatus       any role

      InquiryRequest             any role

      InquiryResponse            any role

4. Security Considerations

   The errata listed herein are not particularly security related.
   Never the less, incorrect implementations due to uncorrected errors
   in the specification may compromise security.
