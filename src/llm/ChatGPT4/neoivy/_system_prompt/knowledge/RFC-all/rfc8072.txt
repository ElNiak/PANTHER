RFC 8072                       YANG Patch                  February 2017


1.  Introduction

   There is a need for standard mechanisms to patch datastores defined
   in [RFC6241], which contain conceptual data that conforms to schema
   specified with YANG [RFC7950].  An "ordered 'edit' list" approach is
   needed to provide RESTCONF client developers with more precise
   RESTCONF client control of the edit procedure than the "plain patch"
   mechanism found in [RFC8040].

   This document defines a media type for a YANG-based editing mechanism
   that can be used with the HTTP PATCH method [RFC5789].  YANG Patch is
   designed to support the RESTCONF protocol, defined in [RFC8040].
   This document only specifies the use of the YANG Patch media type
   with the RESTCONF protocol.

   It may be possible to use YANG Patch with other protocols besides
   RESTCONF.  This is outside the scope of this document.  For any
   protocol that supports the YANG Patch media type, if the entire patch
   document cannot be successfully applied, then the server MUST NOT
   apply any of the changes.  It may be possible to use YANG Patch with
   datastore types other than a configuration datastore.  This is
   outside the scope of this document.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   o  RESTCONF capability

   o  target resource

   o  YANG data template

1.1.5.  YANG Patch

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  RESTCONF client: a client that implements the RESTCONF protocol.

   o  RESTCONF server: a server that implements the RESTCONF protocol.

   o  YANG Patch: a conceptual edit request using the "yang-patch" YANG
      Patch template, defined in Section 3.  In HTTP, refers to a PATCH
      method where a representation uses either the media type
      "application/yang-patch+xml" or "application/yang-patch+json".

   o  YANG Patch Status: a conceptual edit status response using the
      YANG "yang-patch-status" YANG data template, defined in Section 3.
      In HTTP, refers to a response message for a PATCH method, where it
      has a representation with either the media type
      "application/yang-data+xml" or "application/yang-data+json".

   o  YANG Patch template: similar to a YANG data template, except that
      it has a representation with the media type
      "application/yang-patch+xml" or "application/yang-patch+json".

1.1.6.  Examples

   Some protocol message lines within examples throughout this document
   are split into multiple lines for display purposes only.  When a line
   ends with a backslash ("\") as the last character, the line is
   wrapped for display purposes.  It is to be considered to be joined to
   the next line by deleting the backslash, the following line break,
   and the leading whitespace of the next line.

1.1.7.  Tree Diagram Notations

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meanings of the symbols in these diagrams are as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write), "ro" means state data (read-only), and "x"
      means operation resource (executable).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, and "*"
      denotes a "list" and "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  YANG Patch

   A "YANG Patch" is an ordered list of edits that are applied to the
   target datastore by the RESTCONF server.  The specific fields are
   defined in the YANG module in Section 3.

   The YANG Patch operation is invoked by the RESTCONF client by
   sending a PATCH method request with a representation using either
   the media type "application/yang-patch+xml" or
   "application/yang-patch+json".  This message-body representing the
   YANG Patch input parameters MUST be present.

   YANG Patch has some features that are not possible with the
   "plain-patch" mechanism defined in RESTCONF [RFC8040]:

   o  YANG Patch allows multiple sub-resources to be edited within the
      same PATCH method.

   o  YANG Patch allows a more precise edit operation than the
      "plain patch" mechanism found in [RFC8040].  There are seven
      operations supported ("create", "delete", "insert", "merge",
      "move", "replace", and "remove").

   o  YANG Patch uses an "edit" list with an explicit processing order.
      The edits are processed in client-specified order, and error
      processing can be precise even when multiple errors occur in the
      same YANG Patch request.



Bierman, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 8072                       YANG Patch                  February 2017


   The YANG Patch "patch-id" may be useful for debugging and SHOULD be
   present in any audit logging records generated by the RESTCONF server
   for a patch.

   The RESTCONF server MUST return the "Accept-Patch" header field in an
   OPTIONS response, as specified in [RFC5789], which includes the
   media type for YANG Patch.  This is needed by a client to determine
   the message-encoding formats supported by the server (e.g., XML,
   JSON, or both).  The following is an example of an "Accept-Patch"
   header:

    Accept-Patch: application/yang-patch+xml,application/yang-patch+json

   Note that YANG Patch can only edit data resources.  The PATCH method
   cannot be used to replace the datastore resource.  Although the
   "ietf-yang-patch" YANG module is written using YANG version 1.1
   [RFC7950], an implementation of YANG Patch can be used with content
   defined in YANG version 1 [RFC6020] as well.

   A YANG Patch can be encoded in XML format according to
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126].  It can also be encoded in JSON according to
   "JSON Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG" [RFC7951].  If any metadata
   needs to be sent in a JSON message, it is encoded according to
   "Defining and Using Metadata with YANG" [RFC7952].

2.1.  Target Resource

   The YANG Patch operation uses the RESTCONF target resource URI to
   identify the resource that will be patched.  This can be the
   datastore resource itself, i.e., "{+restconf}/data", to edit
   top-level configuration data resources, or it can be a configuration
   data resource within the datastore resource, e.g.,
   "{+restconf}/data/ietf-interfaces:interfaces", to edit sub-resources
   within a top-level configuration data resource.

   The target resource MUST identify exactly one resource instance.  If
   more than one resource instance is identified, then the request
   MUST NOT be processed and a "400 Bad Request" error response MUST be
   sent by the server.  If the target resource does not identify any
   existing resource instance, then the request MUST NOT be processed
   and a "404 Not Found" error response MUST be sent by the server.

   Each edit with a YANG Patch identifies a target data node for the
   associated edit.  This is described in Section 2.4.

RFC 8072                       YANG Patch                  February 2017


2.2.  yang-patch Request

   A YANG Patch is identified by a unique "patch-id", and it may have an
   optional comment.  A patch is an ordered collection of edits.  Each
   edit is identified by an "edit-id", and it has an edit operation
   ("create", "delete", "insert", "merge", "move", "replace", or
   "remove") that is applied to the target resource.  Each edit can be
   applied to a sub-resource "target" within the target resource.  If
   the operation is "insert" or "move", then the "where" parameter
   indicates how the node is inserted or moved.  For values "before" and
   "after", the "point" parameter specifies the data node insertion
   point.

   The "merge", "replace", "create", "delete", and "remove" edit
   operations have exactly the same meanings as those defined for the
   "operation" attribute described in Section 7.2 of [RFC6241].

   Each edit within a YANG Patch MUST identify exactly one data resource
   instance.  If an edit represents more than one resource instance,
   then the request MUST NOT be processed and a "400 Bad Request" error
   response MUST be sent by the server.  If the edit does not identify
   any existing resource instance and the operation for the edit is not
   "create", then the request MUST NOT be processed and a "404 Not
   Found" error response MUST be sent by the server.  A
   "yang-patch-status" response MUST be sent by the server identifying
   the edit or edits that are not valid.

   YANG Patch does not provide any access to specific datastores.  How a
   server processes an edit if it is co-located with a Network
   Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) server that does provide access to
   individual datastores is left up to the implementation.  A complete
   datastore cannot be replaced in the same manner as that provided by
   the <copy-config> operation defined in Section 7.3 of [RFC6241].
   Only the specified nodes in a YANG Patch are affected.

   A message-body representing the YANG Patch is sent by the RESTCONF
   client to specify the edit operation request.  When used with the
   HTTP PATCH method, this data is identified by the YANG Patch
   media type.

2.3.  yang-patch-status Response

   A message-body representing the YANG Patch Status is returned to the
   RESTCONF client to report the detailed status of the edit operation.
   When used with the HTTP PATCH method, this data is identified by the
   YANG Patch Status media type; the syntax specification is defined in
   Section 3.

                             +---- error-info?

2.4.  Target Data Node

   The target data node for each edit operation is determined by the
   value of the target resource in the request and the "target" leaf
   within each "edit" entry.

   If the target resource specified in the request URI identifies a
   datastore resource, then the path string in the "target" leaf is
   treated as an absolute path expression identifying the target data
   node for the corresponding edit.  The first node specified in the
   "target" leaf is a top-level data node defined within a YANG module.
   The "target" leaf MUST NOT contain a single forward slash ("/"),
   since this would identify the datastore resource, not a data
   resource.





Bierman, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 10]

RFC 8072                       YANG Patch                  February 2017


   If the target resource specified in the request URI identifies a
   configuration data resource, then the path string in the "target"
   leaf is treated as a relative path expression.  The first node
   specified in the "target" leaf is a child configuration data node of
   the data node associated with the target resource.  If the "target"
   leaf contains a single forward slash ("/"), then the target data node
   is the target resource data node.

2.5.  Edit Operations

   Each YANG Patch edit specifies one edit operation on the target data
   node.  The set of operations is aligned with the NETCONF edit
   operations but also includes some new operations.

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | Operation | Description                                           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | create    | create a new data resource if it does not already     |
   |           | exist; if it already exists, return an error          |
   |           |                                                       |
   | delete    | delete a data resource if it already exists; if it    |
   |           | does not exist, return an error                       |
   |           |                                                       |
   | insert    | insert a new user-ordered data resource               |
   |           |                                                       |
   | merge     | merge the edit value with the target data resource;   |
   |           | create if it does not already exist                   |
   |           |                                                       |
   | move      | reorder the target data resource                      |
   |           |                                                       |
   | replace   | replace the target data resource with the edit value  |
   |           |                                                       |
   | remove    | remove a data resource if it already exists           |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

                        YANG Patch Edit Operations

2.6.  Successful Edit Response Handling

   If a YANG Patch is completed without errors, the RESTCONF server MUST
   return a "yang-patch-status" message with a "global-status" choice
   set to "ok".

2.7.  Error Handling

   If a well-formed, schema-valid YANG Patch message is received, then
   the RESTCONF server will process the supplied edits in ascending
   order.  The following error modes apply to the processing of this
   "edit" list:

   If a YANG Patch is completed with errors, the RESTCONF server SHOULD
   return a "yang-patch-status" message.  It is possible (e.g., within a
   distributed implementation) that an invalid request will be rejected
   before the YANG Patch edits are processed.  In this case, the server
   MUST send the appropriate HTTP error response instead.

   Refer to Appendix A.1.1 for an example of an error YANG Patch
   response.

2.8.  ":yang-patch" RESTCONF Capability

   A URI is defined to identify the YANG Patch extension to the base
   RESTCONF protocol.  If the RESTCONF server supports the YANG Patch
   media type, then the ":yang-patch" RESTCONF capability defined in
   Section 4.3 MUST be present in the "capability" leaf-list in the
   "ietf-restconf-monitoring" module defined in [RFC8040].

3.  YANG Module

   The "ietf-yang-patch" module defines conceptual definitions with the
   "yang-data" extension statements, which are not meant to be
   implemented as datastore contents by a RESTCONF server.

   The "ietf-restconf" module from [RFC8040] is used by this module for
   the "yang-data" extension definition.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Registrations for New URI and YANG Module

   This document registers one URI as a namespace in the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688].  It follows the format in RFC 3688.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-patch
      Registrant Contact: The IESG.
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers one YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020].

      name:         ietf-yang-patch
      namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-patch
      prefix:       ypatch
      reference:    RFC 8072

4.2.  Media Types

4.2.1.  Media Type "application/yang-patch+xml"

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: yang-patch+xml

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: None

   Encoding considerations: 8-bit
      The "utf-8" charset is always used for this type.
      Each conceptual YANG data node is encoded according to the
      XML Encoding Rules and Canonical Format for the specific
      YANG data node type defined in [RFC7950].
      In addition, the "yang-patch" YANG Patch template found
      in RFC 8072 defines the structure of a YANG Patch request.

   Security considerations: Security considerations related
      to the generation and consumption of RESTCONF messages
      are discussed in Section 5 of RFC 8072.
      Additional security considerations are specific to the
      semantics of particular YANG data models.  Each YANG module
      is expected to specify security considerations for the
      YANG data defined in that module.

   Interoperability considerations: RFC 8072 specifies the format
      of conforming messages and the interpretation thereof.

   Published specification: RFC 8072

   Applications that use this media type: Instance document
      data parsers used within a protocol or automation tool
      that utilize the YANG Patch data structure.

   Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics
      of fragment identifiers are the same as the syntax and semantics
      specified for the "application/xml" media type.

   Additional information:

      Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A
      Magic number(s): N/A
      File extension(s): None
      Macintosh file type code(s): "TEXT"

4.2.2.  Media Type "application/yang-patch+json"

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: yang-patch+json

   Required parameters: None

   Optional parameters: None

   Encoding considerations: 8-bit
      The "utf-8" charset is always used for this type.
      Each conceptual YANG data node is encoded according to
      RFC 7951.  A metadata annotation is encoded according to
      RFC 7952.  In addition, the "yang-patch" YANG Patch
      template found in RFC 8072 defines the structure of a
      YANG Patch request.

4.3.  RESTCONF Capability URNs

   This document registers one capability identifier in the "RESTCONF
   Capability URNs" registry [RFC8040].  The review policy for this
   registry is "IETF Review" [RFC5226].

   Index           Capability Identifier
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   :yang-patch     urn:ietf:params:restconf:capability:yang-patch:1.0

5.  Security Considerations

   The YANG Patch media type does not introduce any significant new
   security threats, beyond what is described in [RFC8040].  This
   document defines edit processing instructions for a variant of the
   PATCH method, as used within the RESTCONF protocol.  Message
   integrity is provided by the RESTCONF protocol.  There is no
   additional capability to validate that a patch has not been altered.

   It may be possible to use YANG Patch with other protocols besides
   RESTCONF; this topic is outside the scope of this document.





Bierman, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 25]

RFC 8072                       YANG Patch                  February 2017


   For RESTCONF, both the client and server MUST be authenticated
   according to Section 2 of [RFC8040].  It is important for RESTCONF
   server implementations to carefully validate all the edit request
   parameters in some manner.  If the entire YANG Patch request cannot
   be completed, then no configuration changes to the system are done.
   A PATCH request MUST be applied atomically, as specified in Section 2
   of [RFC5789].

   A RESTCONF server implementation SHOULD attempt to prevent system
   disruption due to incremental processing of the YANG Patch
   "edit" list.  It may be possible to construct an attack on such a
   RESTCONF server, which relies on the edit processing order mandated
   by YANG Patch.  A server SHOULD apply only the fully validated
   configuration to the underlying system.  For example, an "edit" list
   that deleted an interface and then recreated it could cause system
   disruption if the "edit" list was incrementally applied.

   A RESTCONF server implementation SHOULD attempt to prevent system
   disruption due to excessive resource consumption required to fulfill
   YANG Patch edit requests.  On such an implementation, it may be
   possible to construct an attack that attempts to consume all
   available memory or other resource types.

A.1.  YANG Patch Examples

   This section includes RESTCONF examples.  Most examples are shown in
   JSON encoding [RFC7159], and some are shown in XML encoding
   [W3C.REC-xml-20081126].

A.1.1.  Add Resources: Error

   The following example shows several songs being added to an existing
   album.  Each edit contains one song.  The first song already exists,
   so an error will be reported for that edit.  The rest of the edits
   were not attempted, since the first edit failed.  XML encoding is
   used in this example.

   Request from the RESTCONF client:

      PATCH /restconf/data/example-jukebox:jukebox/\
         library/artist=Foo%20Fighters/album=Wasting%20Light HTTP/1.1
