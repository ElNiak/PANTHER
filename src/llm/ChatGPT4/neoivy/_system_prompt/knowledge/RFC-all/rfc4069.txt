Abstract

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) module for use with network management protocols in the
   Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects used for
   managing the Line Code Specific parameters of Very High Speed Digital
   Subscriber Line (VDSL) interfaces using Single Carrier Modulation
   (SCM) Line Coding.  It is an optional extension to the VDSL-LINE-MIB,
   RFC 3728, which handles line code independent objects.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This document describes an SNMP MIB module for managing the Line Code
   Dependent, Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) Layer of SCM VDSL Lines.
   These definitions are based upon the specifications for VDSL as
   defined in T1E1, European Telecommunications Standards Institute
   (ETSI), and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) documentation
   [T1E1311, T1E1011, T1E1013, ETSI2701, ETSI2702, ITU9931, ITU9971].
   Additionally the protocol-dependent (and line-code dependent)
   management framework for VDSL lines specified by the Digital
   Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has been taken into consideration
   [DSLFTR57] and [DSLFWT96].

   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB-2 transmission.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "RECOMMENDED", and "SHOULD" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.1.  Relationship of this MIB Module to Other MIB Modules

   The relationship of the VDSL Line MIB module to other MIB modules, in
   particular to the IF-MIB presented in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is
   discussed in the VDSL-LINE-MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].  This section
   outlines the relationship of this VDSL Line Extension MIB to the
   VDSL-LINE-MIB, RFC 3728 [RFC3728].

2.2.  Conventions Used in the MIB Module

2.2.1.  Naming Conventions

   A.  Vtuc -- VDSL transceiver unit at near (Central) end of line
   B.  Vtur -- VDSL transceiver unit at Remote end of line
   C.  Vtu  -- One of either Vtuc or Vtur
   D.  Curr -- Current
   F.  Atn  -- Attenuation
   J.  LCS  -- Line Code Specific
   K.  Max  -- Maximum
   Q.  Mgn  -- Margin
   S.  PSD  -- Power Spectral Density
   T.  Rx   -- Receive
   T.  Snr  -- Signal to Noise Ratio
   U.  Tx   -- Transmit

2.3.  Structure

   The SCM VDSL Line Extension MIB contains the following MIB group:

   o   vdslSCMGroup :

   This group supports MIB objects for defining configuration profiles
   and for monitoring individual bands of Single Carrier Modulation
   (SCM) VDSL modems.  It contains the following tables:

      - vdslLineSCMConfProfileTxBandTable
      - vdslSCMPhysBandTable

   If the SCM VDSL Line Extension MIB is implemented then all objects in
   this group MUST be implemented.

   Figure 1 below displays the relationship of the tables in the
   vdslSCMGroup to the vdslGroup and to the ifEntry:

RFC 4069                 VDSL-LINE-EXT-SCM-MIB                  May 2005


      ifEntry(ifType=97)  ----> vdslLineTableEntry 1:(0..1)

       vdslLineTableEntry (vdslLineCoding=SCM)
             ----> vdslPhysTableEntry 1:(0..2)
                 ----> vdslSCMPhysBandTable 1:(0..5)

       vdslLineConfProfileEntry(vdslLineConfProfileName)
                     ----> vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTable 1:(0..5)

                       Figure 1: Table Relationships

   When the object vdslLineCoding is set to SCM, vdslLineConfProfileName
   is used as the index to vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTable.  The
   existence of an entry in any of the tables of the vdslSCMGroup is
   optional.

2.4.  Persistence

   All read-create objects defined in this MIB module SHOULD be stored
   persistently.  Following is an exhaustive list of these persistent
   objects:

      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandId
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandUsage
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandCenterFrequency
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandSymbolRate
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandConstellationSize
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTransmitPSDLevel
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandRowStatus
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandId
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandUsage
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrPSDLevel
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrSymbolRate
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrConstellationSize
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrCenterFrequency
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandPerformanceBandId
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandPerformanceBandUsage
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandPerformanceBandSnrMgn
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandPerformanceBandAtn

   Note also that the interface indices in this MIB are maintained
   persistently.  View-based Access Control Model (VACM) data relating
   to these SHOULD be stored persistently as well [RFC3415].

3.  Conformance and Compliance

   An SCM based VDSL agent does not have to implement this MIB to be
   compliant with RFC 3728 [RFC3728].  If the SCM VDSL Line Extension
   MIB is implemented then the following group is mandatory:

      -  vdslSCMGroup

   DESCRIPTION
      "The VDSL-LINE-MIB found in RFC 3728 defines objects for the
      management of a pair of VDSL transceivers at each end of the VDSL
      line.  The VDSL-LINE-MIB configures and monitors the line code
      independent parameters (TC layer) of the VDSL line.  This MIB
      module is an optional extension of the VDSL-LINE-MIB and defines
      objects for configuration and monitoring of the line code specific
      (LCS) elements (PMD layer) for VDSL lines using SCM coding.  The
      objects in this extension MIB MUST NOT be used for VDSL lines
      using Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM) line coding.  If an object
      in this extension MIB is referenced by a line which does not use
      SCM, it has no effect on the operation of that line.

      Naming Conventions:

         Vtuc -- VDSL transceiver at near (Central) end of line
         Vtur -- VDSL transceiver at Remote end of line
         Vtu  -- One of either Vtuc or Vtur
         Curr -- Current

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTable
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandInUse,
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandTransmitPSDLevel,
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandSymbolRate,



Dodge & Ray                 Standards Track                    [Page 14]

RFC 4069                 VDSL-LINE-EXT-SCM-MIB                  May 2005


      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandConstellationSize,
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandCenterFrequency,
      vdslLineSCMConfProfileBandRowStatus

   VDSL layer connectivity from the Vtur will permit the subscriber to
   manipulate both the VDSL link directly and the VDSL embedded
   operations channel (EOC) for their own loop.  For example, unchecked
   or unfiltered fluctuations initiated by the subscriber could generate
   sufficient notifications to potentially overwhelm either the
   management interface to the network or the element manager.

   Additionally, allowing write access to configuration data may allow
   an end-user to increase their service levels or affect other end-
   users in either a positive or negative manner.  For this reason, the
   tables and objects listed above should be considered to contain
   sensitive information.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      vdslLineSCMPhysBandInUse,
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrPSDLevel,
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrSymbolRate,
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrConstellationSize,
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrCenterFrequency,
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrSnrMgn,
      vdslLineSCMPhysBandCurrAtn

   Read access of the physical band parameters may provide knowledge to
   an end-user that would allow malicious behavior, for example the
   application of an intentional interference on one or all of the
   physical bands in use.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).



Dodge & Ray                 Standards Track                    [Page 15]

RFC 4069                 VDSL-LINE-EXT-SCM-MIB                  May 2005


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of a MIB module is properly configured to give access to the
   objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate rights
   to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned the transmission value 228 to VDSL-LINE-EXT-
   SCM-MIB.
