                          Protocol Information

Introduction

   This file contains information on the various protocols in the ARPA
   Network.  An effort will be made to keep the information current, but
   his depends on the cooperation of the users of this file to convey
   any information about protocol developments, or corrections to this
   information to Jon Postel at SRI-ARC.

      Online address is POSTEL@BBNB; Phone is (415) 326-6200 x 3718;
      U.S. Mail address is Stanford Research Institute, Augmentation
      Research Center, 222 Ravenswood, Menlo park, California 94025.

   This is a compendium of all the protocol related activity and most of
   this activity and most of this activity is with experimental
   protocols, for those protocols, which are official standards the
   designation "[Official]" will be appended to the name.

   This protocol information file is online as:

      Pathname: [OFFICE-1] <NETINFO.PROTOCOL-INFORMATION.TXT

      and also [BBNB] <POSTEL.PROTCOL-INFORMATION.NLS

   Much of the documentation of protocols appears as Requests for
   Comments (RFCs) and many of these are available online.  When a
   document is accessible online a pointer to that source will be given.
   Also note that recent RFCs are online at Office-1 in directory
   <NETINFO> with names of the form RFCnnn.TXT where nnn is replaced by
   the RFC number.  There is also an index of recent RFCs as an online
   file:

      [Office-1] <NETINFOR>RFC-INDEX.TXT

   There are three other online files that are relevant to protocols:

      There is a file that lists Official Host Names and associated
      information as described in RFC 608, the pathname of this file is:

         [Office-1] <NETOINFO>HOSTS.TXT

      There are two files that list the addresses of the Network
      Liaisons, one file lists the online message address, and the other
      the US Mail address and phone number.  A network liaison is a
      person designated by a host organization as the contact and
      coordinator for network technical information fro that
      organization.

      These files are prepared by Jake Feinler of the Network
      Information Center (NIC).  Indeed the NIC has been very helpful in
      providing the online file space for the recent Request for
      Comments, and other protocol related files.  The NIC also
      maintains the hardcopy reference library of all RFCs.

   The NIC has assembled and filed with the National Technical
   information Service the collection of documents known as "ARPA
   Network Current Network Protocols".  This collection represents the
   more or less "official" protocols as of 1-December-74.  The accession
   number is ADA003890.

            Comments:

               The "link number" field has been extended from 8 to 12
               bits and renamed the "message identification" field.
               Message type 6 now is used to indicate a reason for at
               type 7 (destination dead) message. (See BBN1822).

               There has been some recent changes to the Ready line
               interpretation by the IMP for deciding the alive/dead
               status of a host.

               Important changes to the IMP and IMP/HOST Interface
               announced in RFC 660 23-Oct-74.

               (31-DEC-74) The change to allow up to eight messages to
               be in transit between a source host and destination host
               should be made very soon.  This should not effect the
               hosts at all except to provide better thruput and fewer
               inter-message delays.

               (6-JAN-75) BBN Report 1822 updated.

                  Sections 1, 2, 4, and 5, and Appendix C now include
                  data on the Pluribus IMP.  The Pluribus IMP is based
                  on a modular mutliprocessor hardware design; it should
                  be capable of much higher bandwidth and greater
                  reliability than other IMP models.

                  Section 3.1 contains additional information, which may
                  be helpful to Host programmers.

                  Section 3.3 and 3.4 add a new type of Host to Host
                  data message, the uncontrolled packet.  Section 3.7
                  has been added to describe the use of this new message
                  type.

                  Section 3.4 describes changes to the sub-types of IMP
                  to host message types 6 and 7.

                  Appendix A has been updated.

                  Appendix B has been expanded to provide specific
                  recommendations for Host implementation of the
                  Host/IMP Interface.

                  Minor clarifications have been made in Appendix F. (No
                  changes have been made to Figure F - (or F-9.)

            Recent developments:

               (18-June-75) Very important changes to the Host to IMP
               and IMP to Host interface protocol are proposed
               (specified?) in a recent note.  The areas changed
               include: expanded leader size, expanded address field,
               new message length field, expanded handling type field,
               source host control of packets per message, change in the
               handling of unordered messages (current type 3 messages),
               change in the addressing of fake hosts, including an
               address field in the IMP/Host hop message, (best of all)
               backward compatibility, and a possible change in the
               maximum message length.

         progress on handling of single message conversations.  A new
         sequencing scheme (proposed by Tomlinson) may be utilized.  The
         addressing field is now used as 4 bit format, 4 bit network, 16
         bit TCP, and 24 bit process&port.

         Crocker has suggested a 64 bit path address to be parsed and
         reformatted by the gateways along the route.  There is
         reluctance to experiment with too many things at once though.

         (28-Oct-74) A file indicating some of the changes in the

            Status of TCP development.  The BBN version is running at
            BBN-TENEXA, but simulates a lot of JSYS calls which will be
            cast into the tenex operating system during the summer.  The
            SU-DSL version for the PDP-11/20 is in the debugging stage.
            The UCL (London) version for a PDP-9 is in the coding stage.
            We are continuing with the "three-way handshake" version
            which is highly reliable in environments which permit
            packets to be delivered on the order of hours later than
            they were injected into the connected networks.  A simple
            TCP is being designed for the packet radio network and does
            not use three-way handshake since waiting a second or so to
            clear out old packets in not serious.

            A test plan for packet radio net, arpanet, and atlantic
            satellite networks is in preparation (delivery date 1 August
            1975).

            Recent international agreements indicate that a form of TCP
            with a simpler header (144 bits instead of 256 bits) and no
            three-way handshake is the most likely international
            standard.  An IFIP WG 6.1 Recommendation to CCITT stated
            that the maximum packet delay through all concatenated
            networks should not exceed 30 seconds.

         (20-JAN-75) An initial version of NVP was implemented for
         real-time voice experiments between ISI and Lincoln Laboratory
         in August 1974.  An expanded version has been in operation
         since December 1974 for real-time voice communication between
         Lincoln and CHI.  NVP uses both type 0 and type 3 IMP-Host
         messages, and allows increased bandwidth and decreased delays
         at the cost of reliability.

RFC 694                   Protocol Information             June 18, 1975


         All Hosts were to have been running the new Telnet (both user
         and server) by 1 January 1974.

      Comments:

         Note: the server program is to be available on socket 23
         decimal (27 octal).

         The Status Option has been revised to take advantage of the
         subcommand feature and to reduce the amount of data transmitted
         to report the option status.

         Seven new options have been defined to allow control of the
         format effectors Carriage Return, Line Feed, Form Feed,
         Horizontal Tab, and Vertical Tab.

NATIONAL SOFTWARE WORKS

   The national Software Works (NSW) is developing a set of protocols
   for its use of the ARPA Network, other uses of these protocols is
   encouraged.

   The Distributed Programming System (DPS) is intended to facilitate
   the sharing of resources in the network at the subroutine level.  The
   Distributed Programming System will be used to split NLS into a front
   end and back end components.  Distributed Programming system is also
   to be used in the NSW and the basis for communication between the
   Works Manager, the Tool Bearing Hosts, and Front End procedure
   packages.

   The documents cited below give a view of the Distributed Programming
   System and its use.

   Documents:

      The documents cited here represent the state of the protocol in
      January-75, much as changed since that time that has not been
      adequately documented, therefore, these documents should be viewed
      as generally descriptive not specifically definitive.

      Each is available online in two forms: as an NLS file and as a
      formatted text file.  The Journal number (e.g., 24459) refers to
      the former, of course and the pathname (e.g., [BBNB] <NLS>PCP.TXT)
      to the latter, accessible via FTP using username=ANONYMOUS and
      password=GUEST (no account required).

      In addition, these documents are available from Jon Postel in
      hardcopy.
