   IANA Allocation Procedures for the GMPLS OTN Signal Type Registry

Abstract

   IANA defined the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry
   in RFC 7139.  This document updates the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry
   to allow registration via Specification Required.

1.  Introduction

   IANA maintains "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry
   for OTN signal types (as defined in [RFC4328] and updated by
   [RFC7139]).  This subregistry is defined to use only the Standards
   Action registration policy as defined by [RFC5226].  This document
   updates [RFC7139] to allow the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to also
   use the Specification Required policy as defined in [RFC5226].

2.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new security considerations to
   the existing GMPLS signaling protocols.  Refer to [RFC7139] for
   further details of the specific security measures.  Additionally,
   [RFC5920] provides an overview of security vulnerabilities and
   protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control plane.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "OTN Signal Type" subregistry of the "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters"
   registry.  The registry currently is defined to use the Standards
   Action registration policy as defined by [RFC5226].

   Per this document, IANA has updated the registration policies for the
   "OTN Signal Type" subregistry to be "Standards Action" for Standards
   Track documents and "Specification Required" for other documents.
