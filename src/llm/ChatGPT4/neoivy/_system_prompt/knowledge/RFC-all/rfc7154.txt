1.  Introduction

   The work of the IETF relies on cooperation among a diverse range of
   people with different ideas and communication styles.  The IETF
   strives, through these guidelines for conduct, to create and maintain
   an environment in which every person is treated with dignity,
   decency, and respect.  People who participate in the IETF are
   expected to behave in a professional manner as we work together to
   develop interoperable technologies for the Internet.  We aim to abide
   by these guidelines as we build consensus in person and through email
   discussions.  If conflicts arise, they are resolved according to the
   procedures outlined in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].

   This document obsoletes RFC 3184 [RFC3184], as it is an updated
   version of the guidelines for conduct.

2.  Guidelines for Conduct

   1. IETF participants extend respect and courtesy to their colleagues
      at all times.

      IETF participants come from diverse origins and backgrounds; there
      can be different expectations or assumptions.  Regardless of these
      individual differences, participants treat their colleagues with
      respect as persons especially when it is difficult to agree with
      them: treat other participants as you would like to be treated.

      English is the de facto language of the IETF.  However, it is not
      the native language of many IETF participants.  All participants,
      particularly those with English as a first language, attempt to
      accommodate the needs of other participants by communicating
      clearly, including speaking slowly and limiting the use of slang.
      When faced with English that is difficult to understand, IETF
      participants make a sincere effort to understand each other and
      engage in conversation to clarify what was meant.

   2. IETF participants have impersonal discussions.

      We dispute ideas by using reasoned argument rather than through
      intimidation or personal attack.  Try to provide data and facts
      for your standpoints so the rest of the participants who are
      sitting on the sidelines watching the discussion can form an
      opinion.  The discussion is easier when the response to a simple
      question is a polite answer [SQPA].

   3. IETF participants devise solutions for the global Internet that
      meet the needs of diverse technical and operational environments.

      The mission of the IETF is to produce high-quality, relevant
      technical and engineering documents that influence the way people
      design, use, and manage the Internet in such a way as to make the
      Internet work better.  The IETF puts its emphasis on technical
      competence, rough consensus, and individual participation, and it
      needs to be open to competent input from any source.  We
      understand that "scaling is the ultimate problem" and that many
      ideas that are quite workable on a small scale fail this crucial
      test.

      IETF participants use their best engineering judgment to find the
      best solution for the whole Internet, not just the best solution
      for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user.  While we
      all have ideas that may stand improvement from time to time, no
      one shall ever knowingly contribute advice or text that would make
      a standard technically inferior.

   4. Individuals are prepared to contribute to the ongoing work of the
      group.

      We follow the intellectual property guidelines outlined in BCP 79
      [RFC3979].  IETF participants read the relevant Internet-Drafts,
      RFCs, and email archives in order to familiarize themselves with
      the technology under discussion.  Working Group sessions run on a
      very limited time schedule, and sometimes participants have to
      limit their questions.  The work of the group will continue on the
      mailing list, and questions can be asked and answered on the
      mailing list.  It can be a challenge to participate in a Working
      Group without knowing the history of longstanding Working Group
      debates.  Information about a Working Group including its charter
      and milestones is available on the IETF datatracker site [TRACK]
      or from the Working Group Chair.

3.  Security Considerations

   The IETF guidelines for conduct do not directly affect the security
   of the Internet.  However, it is to be noted that there is an
   expectation that no one shall ever knowingly contribute advice or
   text that may adversely affect the security of the Internet without
   describing all known or foreseen risks and threats to potential
   implementers and users that they are aware of.

Appendix A.  Reporting Transgressions of the Guidelines

   An individual can report transgressions of the guidelines for conduct
   to the IETF Chair or the IESG.

Appendix B. Consequences of Transgressing the Guidelines

   This document does not discuss measures that can be taken against a
   participant transgressing the guidelines for conduct.

   RFC 2418 [RFC2418] describes a measure where a Working Group Chair
   has the authority to refuse to grant the floor to any individual who
   is unprepared or otherwise covering inappropriate material, or who,
   in the opinion of the Chair, is disrupting the Working Group process.

   RFC 3683 [RFC3683] describes "posting rights" action to remove the
   posting rights of an individual.  RFC 3934 [RFC3934] describes a
   measure through which a Working Group Chair can suspend posting
   privileges of a disruptive individual for a short period of time.

Appendix C. Changes from RFC 3184

   o  Added text about the IETF striving to create an environment in
      which every person is treated with dignity, decency, and respect.

   o  Added text about contributing advice or text that may affect the
      security of the Internet.

   o  The recommendation that newcomers should not interfere with the
      ongoing process in Section 2 was removed as it can be read as
      discouraging newcomers from participating in discussions.

   o  The text about the goal of the IETF was replaced with text about
      the mission statement and what the IETF puts its emphasis on.

   o  The text about "think globally" was removed as the meaning was not
      clear.

   o  The text about English as a first language was clarified.

   o  The guideline about impersonal discussions was reworded as a
      positive statement.
