1.  Introduction

   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [FIPS-197] has become the go-
   to algorithm for encryption.  It is now the most commonly used
   algorithm in many areas, including IPsec Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs).  On most modern platforms, AES is anywhere from four to ten
   times as fast as the previously popular cipher, Triple Data
   Encryption Standard (3DES) [SP800-67].  3DES also uses a 64-bit
   block; this means that the amount of data that can be encrypted
   before rekeying is required is limited.  These reasons make AES not
   only the best choice, but the only viable choice for IPsec.

   The problem is that if future advances in cryptanalysis reveal a
   weakness in AES, VPN users will be in an unenviable position.  With
   the only other widely supported cipher for IPsec implementations
   being the much slower 3DES, it is not feasible to reconfigure IPsec
   installations away from AES.  [Standby-Cipher] describes this issue
   and the need for a standby cipher in greater detail.

   This document proposes the fast and secure ChaCha20 stream cipher as
   such a standby cipher in an Authenticated Encryption with Associated
   Data (AEAD) construction with the Poly1305 authenticator for use with
   the Encapsulated Security Protocol (ESP) [RFC4303] and the Internet
   Key Exchange Protocol version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296].  The algorithms
   are described in a separate document ([RFC7539]).  This document only
   describes the IPsec-specific things.

RFC 7634              ChaCha20 & Poly1305 for IPsec          August 2015


1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for ESP

   AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305 ([RFC7539]) is a combined mode algorithm, or
   AEAD.  Usage follows the AEAD construction in Section 2.8 of RFC
   7539:

   o  The Initialization Vector (IV) is 64 bits and is used as part of
      the nonce.  The IV MUST be unique for each invocation for a
      particular security association (SA) but does not need to be
      unpredictable.  The use of a counter or a linear feedback shift
      register (LFSR) is RECOMMENDED.

   o  A 32-bit Salt is prepended to the 64-bit IV to form the 96-bit
      nonce.  The salt is fixed per SA, and it is not transmitted as
      part of the ESP packet.

   o  The encryption key is 256 bits.

   o  The Internet Key Exchange Protocol generates a bitstring called
      KEYMAT using a pseudorandom function (PRF).  That KEYMAT is
      divided into keys for encryption, message authentication, and
      whatever else is needed.  The KEYMAT requested for each
      ChaCha20-Poly1305 key is 36 octets.  The first 32 octets are the
      256-bit ChaCha20 key, and the remaining 4 octets are used as the
      Salt value in the nonce.

   The ChaCha20 encryption algorithm requires the following parameters:
   a 256-bit key, a 96-bit nonce, and a 32-bit Initial Block Counter.
   For ESP, we set these as follows:

   o  The key is set as mentioned above.

   o  The 96-bit nonce is formed from a concatenation of the 32-bit Salt
      and the 64-bit IV, as described above.

   o  The Initial Block Counter is set to one (1).  The reason that one
      is used for the initial counter rather than zero is that zero is
      reserved for generating the one-time Poly1305 key (see below).

RFC 7634              ChaCha20 & Poly1305 for IPsec          August 2015


   As the ChaCha20 block function is not applied directly to the
   plaintext, no padding should be necessary.  However, in keeping with
   the specification in RFC 4303, the plaintext always has a pad length
   octet and a Next Header octet, and it may require padding octets so
   as to align the buffer to an integral multiple of 4 octets.

   The same key and nonce, along with a block counter of zero, are
   passed to the ChaCha20 block function, and the top 256 bits of the
   result are used as the Poly1305 key.

   Finally, the Poly1305 function is run on the data to be
   authenticated, which is, as specified in Section 2.8 of [RFC7539], a
   concatenation of the following in the order below:

   o  The Authenticated Additional Data (AAD); see Section 2.1.

   o  Zero-octet padding that rounds the length up to 16 octets.  This
      is 4 or 8 octets depending on the length of the AAD.

   o  The ciphertext.

   o  Zero-octet padding that rounds the total length up to an integral
      multiple of 16 octets.

   o  The length of the AAD in octets (as a 64-bit integer encoded in
      little-endian byte order).

   o  The length of the ciphertext in octets (as a 64-bit integer
      encoded in little-endian byte order).

   The 128-bit output of Poly1305 is used as the tag.  All 16 octets are
   included in the packet.

   o  The IV field is 64 bits.  It is the final 64 bits of the 96-bit
      nonce.  If the counter method is used for generating unique IVs,
      then the final 32 bits of the IV will be equal to the Sequence
      Number field.

   o  The length of the Padding field need not exceed 4 octets.
      However, neither RFC 4303 nor this specification require using the
      minimal padding length.

   o  The Integrity Check Value field contains the 16-octet tag.

2.1.  AAD Construction

   The construction of the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) is
   similar to the one in [RFC4106].  For security associations (SAs)
   with 32-bit sequence numbers, the AAD is 8 octets: a 4-octet SPI
   followed by a 4-octet sequence number ordered exactly as it is in the
   packet.  For SAs with an Extended Sequence Number (ESN), the AAD is
   12 octets: a 4-octet SPI followed by an 8-octet sequence number as a
   64-bit integer in big-endian byte order.

RFC 7634              ChaCha20 & Poly1305 for IPsec          August 2015


3.  Use in IKEv2

   AEAD algorithms can be used in IKE, as described in [RFC5282].  More
   specifically:

   o  The Encrypted Payload is as described in Section 3 of RFC 5282.

   o  The ChaCha20-Poly1305 keying material is derived similarly to ESP:
      36 octets are requested for each of SK_ei and SK_er, of which the
      first 32 form the key and the last 4 form the salt.  No octets are
      requested for SK_ai and SK_ar.

   o  The IV is 64 bits, as described in Section 2, and is included
      explicitly in the Encrypted payload.

   o  The sender SHOULD include no padding and set the Pad Length field
      to zero.  The receiver MUST accept any length of padding.

   o  The AAD is as described in Section 5.1 of RFC 5282, so it is 32
      octets (28 for the IKEv2 header plus 4 octets for the encrypted
      payload header), assuming no unencrypted payloads.

4.  Negotiation in IKEv2

   When negotiating the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm for use in IKE or
   IPsec, the value ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 (28) should be used in the
   transform substructure of the SA payload as the ENCR (type 1)
   transform ID.  As with other AEAD algorithms, INTEG (type 3)
   transform substructures MUST NOT be specified, or just one INTEG
   transform MAY be included with value NONE (0).

5.  Security Considerations

   The ChaCha20 cipher is designed to provide 256-bit security.

   The Poly1305 authenticator is designed to ensure that forged messages
   are rejected with a probability of 1-(n/(2^102)) for a 16n-octet
   message, even after sending 2^64 legitimate messages, so it is
   SUF-CMA (strong unforgeability against chosen-message attacks) in the
   terminology of [AE].

   The most important security consideration in implementing this
   document is the uniqueness of the nonce used in ChaCha20.  The nonce
   should be selected uniquely for a particular key, but
   unpredictability of the nonce is not required.  Counters and LFSRs
   are both acceptable ways of generating unique nonces.





Nir                          Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 7634              ChaCha20 & Poly1305 for IPsec          August 2015


   Another issue with implementing these algorithms is avoiding side
   channels.  This is trivial for ChaCha20, but requires some care for
   Poly1305.  Considerations for implementations of these algorithms are
   in [RFC7539].

   The Salt value in used nonce construction in ESP and IKEv2 is derived
   from the keystream, same as the encryption key.  It is never
   transmitted on the wire, but the security of the algorithm does not
   depend on its secrecy.  Thus, implementations that keep keys and
   other secret material within some security boundary MAY export the
   Salt from the security boundary.  This may be useful if the API
   provided by the library accepts the nonce as a parameter rather than
   the IV.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the value 28 as a transform identifier for the
   algorithm described in this document in the "Transform Type 1 -
   Encryption Algorithm Transform IDs" registry with name
   ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 and this document as reference for both ESP
   and IKEv2.

RFC 7634              ChaCha20 & Poly1305 for IPsec          August 2015


Appendix A.  ESP Example

   For this example, we will use a tunnel-mode ESP SA using the
   ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm.  The keying material is as follows:

  KEYMAT:
  000  80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 8a 8b 8c 8d 8e 8f  ................
  016  90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 9a 9b 9c 9d 9e 9f  ................
  032  a0 a1 a2 a3                                      ....

   Obviously not a great PRF.  The first 32 octets are the key and the
   final 4 octets (0xa0 0xa1 0xa2 0xa3) are the salt.  For the packet,
   we will use an ICMP packet from 198.51.100.5 to 192.0.2.5:

  Source Packet:
  000  45 00 00 54 a6 f2 00 00 40 01 e7 78 c6 33 64 05  E..T....@..x.3d.

  080  34 35 36 37                                      4567

   The SA details are as follows:

   o  The key and Salt are as above.

   o  The SPI is 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04.

   o  The next sequence number is 5; ESN is not enabled.

   o  The gateway IP address for this side is 203.0.113.153; The peer
      address is 203.0.113.5.

   o  NAT was not detected.

   The 64-bit IV is 0x10 0x11 0x12 0x13 0x14 0x15 0x16 0x17.  Putting
   together the salt and IV we get the nonce:

RFC 7634              ChaCha20 & Poly1305 for IPsec          August 2015


   The plaintext to encrypt consists of the source IP packet plus the
   padding:

  Plaintext (includes padding and pad length):

   With the key, nonce, and plaintext available, we can call the
   ChaCha20 function and encrypt the packet, producing the ciphertext:

  Ciphertext:
  000  24 03 94 28 b9 7f 41 7e 3c 13 75 3a 4f 05 08 7b  $..(..A~<.u:O..{

  080  91 65 b8 28 29 f6 41 e0                          .e.().A.

   To calculate the tag, we need a one-time Poly1305 key, which we
   calculate by calling the ChaCha20 function again with the same key
   and nonce, but a block count of zero.

  Poly1305 one-time key:

   The AAD is constructed by concatenating the SPI to the sequence
   number:

   000  01 02 03 04 00 00 00 05                          ........

   The input to the Poly1305 function is constructed by concatenating
   and padding the AAD and ciphertext:

  Poly1305 Input:

Appendix B.  IKEv2 Example

   For the IKEv2 example, we'll use the following:

   o  The key is 0x80..0x9f, the same as in Appendix A.

   o  The Salt is 0xa0 0xa1 0xa2 0xa3.

   o  The IV will also be the same as in the previous example.  The fact
      that the IV and Salt are both the same means that the nonce is
      also the same.

   o  Because the key and nonce are the same, so is the one-time
      Poly1305 key.

   o  The packet will be an INFORMATIONAL request carrying a single
      payload: a Notify payload with type SET_WINDOW_SIZE, setting the
      window size to 10.

   o  iSPI = 0xc0 0xc1 0xc2 0xc3 0xc4 0xc5 0xc6 0xc7.

   o  rSPI = 0xd0 0xd1 0xd2 0xd3 0xd4 0xd5 0xd6 0xd7.

   o  Message ID shall be 9.

   The Notify Payload:
   000  00 00 00 0c 00 00 40 01 00 00 00 0a              ......@.....

   Plaintext (with no padding and a zero pad length):
   000  00 00 00 0c 00 00 40 01 00 00 00 0a 00           ......@......

RFC 7634              ChaCha20 & Poly1305 for IPsec          August 2015


   Ciphertext:
   000  61 03 94 70 1f 8d 01 7f 7c 12 92 48 89           a..p....|..H.

   The AAD is constructed by appending the IKE header to the encrypted
   payload header.  Note that the length field in the IKE header and the
   length field in the encrypted payload header have to be calculated
   before constructing the AAD:

  AAD:
  000  c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7  ................
  016  2e 20 25 00 00 00 00 09 00 00 00 45 29 00 00 29  . %........E)..)

   In this case, the length of the AAD is an integral multiple of 16, so
   when constructing the input to Poly1305 there was no need for
   padding.  The ciphertext is 13 octets long, so it is followed by 3
   zero octets.  The input to Poly1305 is 32 octets of AAD, 13 octets of
   ciphertext, 3 octets of zero padding, and two 8-octet length fields
   in little-endian byte order.

  Poly1305 Input:
  000  c0 c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 c6 c7 d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 d7  ................
