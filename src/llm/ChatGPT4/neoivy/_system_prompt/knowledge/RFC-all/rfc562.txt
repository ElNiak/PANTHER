NIC: 18638                                                28 August 1973

               Modifications to the TELNET Specification

   Almost four months have passed since the new TELNET Protocol
   specification was published.  Since then, only two RFCs have been
   issued suggesting modifications, and the most recent of these was
   distributed two months ago.  Further, the date from the old TELNET to
   the new TELNET (1 January 1974) is only four months away.  It
   therefore seems appropriate to officially modify the specification to
   account for the suggested modifications, and to declare a moratorium
   on the incorporation of additional suggestions until after the
   switchover. (Of course, no moratorium on the specification of
   additional options is required.)

   The two attached documents represent the revised TELNET Protocol
   specifications; they replace NIC #15372, TELNET Protocol
   Specification, and NIC #15373, TELNET Option Specifications.  The
   remainder of this RFC summarizes the changes.  Page numbers refer to
   the earlier documents.

Changes to TELNET Protocol Specification

   Page 8        - The phrase "blocked on input" is removed (see RFC
                   #513).

   Page 9, 10    - An additional use of IP is mentioned (see RFC #529).

   Page 10       - The explanation of AO is expanded (see RFC #513).

   Page 11       - The definition of "'print position' (e.g., an
                   overstrike)" is clarified (see RFC #513).

   Page 11, 12   - The description of the TELNET Synch Signal is
                   reworked to be in conformance with the ideas of RFC
                   #529 (also see RFC #513).

   Page 14       - The explanation of the CR-NUL convention is expanded
                   (see RFC #513).

   Page 16       - An additional command, End of Subnegotiation
                   Parameters (SE) is defined (see RFCs 513, 529).
