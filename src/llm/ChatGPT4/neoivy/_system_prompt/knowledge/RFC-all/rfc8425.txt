            IANA Considerations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
                    Prefix Information Option Flags

Abstract

   The Prefix Information Option (PIO) in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   Router Advertisement message defines an 8-bit flag field; this field
   has two flags defined, and the remaining 6 bits are reserved
   (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 defines a flag from this field without
   creating an IANA registry or updating RFC 4861.  The purpose of this
   document is to create an IANA registry for the PIO flags.  This
   document updates RFC 4861.

1.  Introduction

   The Prefix Information Option (PIO) in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   Router Advertisement message defines an 8-bit flag field; this field
   has two flags defined and the remaining 6 bits are reserved
   (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 defines a flag from this field without
   creating an IANA registry or updating RFC 4861.  The purpose of this
   document is to create a new registry for the PIO flags.

2.  Current Prefix Information Option Flags

   Currently, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol Prefix Information Option
   [RFC4861] contains the following one-bit flags defined in published
   RFCs:

                               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                              |L|A|R|Reserved1|
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

3.  Updates to RFC 4861

   This document updates Section 4.6.2 "Prefix Information" of [RFC4861]
   to point to the IANA registry that is created in this document (see
   Section 4).

   Specifically, the current list of flags in the Prefix Information
   Option can be found in the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix
   Information Option Flags" registry.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created a new registry for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix
   Information Option flags.  This registry includes the current flags
   in the PIO.  The initial contents of the registry are as follows:

       +----------------+---------------------------------+-----------+
       | PIO Option Bit | Description                     | Reference |
       +----------------+---------------------------------+-----------+
       | 0              | L - On-link Flag                | [RFC4861] |
       | 1              | A - Autonomous Address          | [RFC4861] |
       |                |     Configuration Flag          |           |
       | 2              | R - Router Address Flag         | [RFC6275] |
       | 3-7            | Reserved                        |           |
       +----------------+---------------------------------+-----------+

     Figure 2: IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Information Option Flags

   The assignment of new flags in the PIO option header requires
   Standards Action [RFC8126].

   The registry for these flags is available at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters>.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.
