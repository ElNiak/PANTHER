          Triggering DHCPv6 Reconfiguration from Relay Agents

Abstract

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 messages: Reconfigure-Request
   and Reconfigure-Reply.  The Reconfigure-Request message is sent by a
   DHCPv6 relay agent to notify a DHCPv6 server about a configuration
   information change, so that the DHCPv6 server can send a Reconfigure
   message accordingly.  The Reconfigure-Reply message is used by the
   server to acknowledge the receipt of the Reconfigure-Request message.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies two new DHCPv6 messages [RFC3315]:
   Reconfigure-Request and Reconfigure-Reply.

   Section 3 describes a typical problem scenario encountered that
   triggers the DHCPv6 server to issue a Reconfigure message when the
   configuration data is supplied by the relay agent.  This problem may
   be encountered in other contexts.  It is out of scope of this
   document to list all these cases.

   Section 4 describes the proposed solution that relies on the use of
   Reconfigure-Request and Reconfigure-Reply messages.  The Reconfigure-
   Request message is sent by a DHCPv6 relay agent to notify a DHCPv6
   server about a configuration-information change, so that the DHCPv6
   server can send a Reconfigure message accordingly.  The Reconfigure-
   Reply message is used by the server to acknowledge the receipt of
   Reconfigure-Request.

   Section 5 specifies the Link Address Option used by the relay agent
   to indicate the link on which the client is located to the server.

   Section 6 provides the detailed specification of the procedure to
   trigger Reconfigure messages by DHCPv6 relay agents.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Problem Statement

   For cases where the DHCPv6 relay agent possesses some information
   that would be useful to the DHCPv6 client, [RFC6422] specifies a
   mechanism whereby the DHCPv6 relay agent can provide such information
   to the DHCPv6 server, which can, in turn, pass this information on to
   the DHCP client.  This is achieved by use of RSOO (Relay-Supplied
   Options option), which carries configuration data to the DHCPv6
   server.  The data conveyed in an RSOO is then sent back by the DHCPv6
   server to the requesting DHCPv6 client.

   An example of RSOO usage is shown in Figure 1; only a subset of
   exchanged DHCPv6 and RADIUS messages is represented.  Figure 1 shows
   a broadband network scenario in which the Network Access Server (NAS)
   embeds a DHCPv6 relay agent.

RFC 6977         DHCPv6 Relay-Triggered Reconfiguration        July 2013


   A configuration change may result in an exchange of CoA (Change-of-
   Authorization) [RFC5176] messages between the NAS/DHCPv6 relay agent
   and Dynamic Authorization Client (DAC) server as shown in Figure 2.
   In this example, the NAS answers with a CoA-Ack message to notify the
   DAC that the CoA-Request has been successfully handled.

   Note that the change of the configuration in the DHCPv6 relay agent
   can be triggered by any other out-of-band mechanism.

                                    ....

                     Figure 2: Change of Configuration

   Whenever the configuration information sent by the DHCPv6 relay agent
   to the DHCPv6 server changes, the DHCPv6 server has no means of
   detecting the change so that it can send a Reconfigure message
   accordingly.  A solution is sketched in Section 4.

4.  Solution Overview

   To solve the problem described in Section 3, this document proposes a
   new DHCP message called Reconfigure-Request.  In the example depicted
   in Figure 3, a Reconfigure-Request message is sent by the DHCPv6
   relay agent to a DHCPv6 server as soon as the configuration data
   conveyed in an RSOO has changed.  Upon receipt of this message, and
   if it is configured to support such a mode, the DHCPv6 server must
   build Reconfigure-Reply and Reconfigure messages.  Reconfigure-Reply
   is used to acknowledge the receipt of Reconfigure-Request.  The
   Reconfigure message encapsulated in Relay-Reply is sent to the DHCPv6
   relay, which in turn will forward the message to the appropriate
   DHCPv6 client.

   This setup assumes the relay has a record of the client, so that it
   has enough information to send the Reconfigure-Request message to the
   server.  How the state is recorded in the relay is out of scope of
   this document.  For better resilience of the proposed solution, means
   to recover state in the event of failure (e.g., use of stable
   storage, DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery [RFC5460]) need to be supported.
   These state recovery solutions are not discussed in this document.

              Figure 3: Flow Example with Reconfigure-Request

   The support of Reconfigure-Reply messages simplifies the
   retransmission procedure of the relay as it provides an explicit
   indication from the server (see Section 6.3 for more details).  An
   alternative approach is the relay monitors' Reconfigure messages
   received from the server to conclude whether or not the Reconfigure-
   Request was successfully handled.  Nevertheless, this implicit
   approach may fail to achieve its goals in some cases: for example,
   the server accepts the request but it delays generating the
   corresponding Reconfigure messages due to its rate-limiting policies,
   the request was partially failed for some clients, etc.  To avoid
   useless reconfigure cycles (e.g., due to the loss of Reconfigure-
   Reply messages), the approach adopted in this document allows the
   relay to correct the content of a retransmitted Reconfigure-Request
   based on some observed events (e.g., the client has retrieved the
   updated configuration).  If the relay has no client to be
   reconfigured, it stops sending Reconfigure-Request messages.

   The Reconfigure-Request message can also be used in scenarios other
   than those that assume the use of RSOO.  It is out of scope of this
   document to describe all these scenarios.

   The description of the fields are as follows:

      option-code: OPTION_LINK_ADDRESS (80)

      option-len: 16 (octets)

      link-address: An IPv6 address used by the server to identify the
      link on which the client is located.

   The Link Address Option is used by the relay agent to indicate to the
   server the link on which the client is located.  The relay agent MUST
   use a link-address value that is equivalent to the value used when
   relaying messages from the client to the server.  Two link-address
   values are said to be equivalent if both values are IPv6 addresses
   that are on-link for the network link to which the client is
   connected.

   To defend against poor implementations that do not correctly evaluate
   equivalence, the relay agent SHOULD use the same value that was sent
   to the DHCPv6 server when relaying messages from the client to the
   server, as in Section 20.1.1 of [RFC3315].

6.  Detailed Specification

6.1.  Messages Format

   Two new message type codes are defined:

   o  RECONFIGURE-REQUEST (18)

   o  RECONFIGURE-REPLY (19)



Boucadair & Pougnard         Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 6977         DHCPv6 Relay-Triggered Reconfiguration        July 2013


   Reconfigure-Request and Reconfigure-Reply use the same format as
   defined in Section 6 of [RFC3315].

6.2.  Messages Validation

6.2.1.  Reconfigure-Request

   Clients MUST silently discard any received Reconfigure-Request
   messages.

   Servers MUST discard any received Reconfigure-Request messages that
   meet any of the following conditions:

   o  the message does not include a Client Identifier Option [RFC3315].

   o  the message does not include a Link Address Option (Section 5).

   o  the message includes a Server Identifier Option [RFC3315] but the
      contents of the Server Identifier Option do not match the server's
      identifier.

6.2.2.  Reconfigure-Reply

   Clients and servers MUST silently discard any received Reconfigure-
   Reply messages.

   The relay MUST silently discard any received Reconfigure-Reply
   messages that meet any of the following conditions:

   o  the "transaction-id" field in the message does not match the value
      used in the original message.

   o  the message does not include a Server Identifier Option.

   o  the message does not include a Status Code Option [RFC3315].

6.3.  Creation and Transmission of a Reconfigure-Request

   For any event (e.g., modification of the configuration information)
   that requires the server to issue a Reconfigure message, the relay
   agent determines the client(s) affected by the change and then builds
   a Reconfigure-Request message: the relay agent sets the "msg-type"
   field to RECONFIGURE-REQUEST, generates a transaction ID, and inserts
   it in the "transaction-id" field.

   The relay agent MUST include one or more Client Identifier Options
   [RFC3315] and a Link Address Option (Section 5) so that the DHCPv6

   server can identify the corresponding client and the link on which
   the client is located.

   The relay agent MAY include a Relay Identifier Option [RFC5460].

   The relay agent MAY supply the updated configuration in the RSOO
   [RFC6422].  The relay agent MAY supply a Reconfigure Message Option
   to indicate which form of Reconfigure to use.  The relay agent MAY
   include any option (e.g., Interface Identifier [RFC3315]) that it
   might insert when relaying a message received from a client.

   When several clients on the same link are affected by a configuration
   change, the relay MUST include several Client Identifier Options;
   each of these options identifies a specific client.  If including the
   Client Identifier Options of all impacted clients exceeds the maximum
   message size (see Section 7), the relay MUST generate several
   Reconfigure-Request messages required to carry all Client Identifier
   Options.  Rate-limit considerations are discussed in Section 7.

   The relay sets the destination address of the Reconfigure-Request
   message to the IP address it would have sent a Relay-Forward message
   (see Section 20 of [RFC3315]).

   In case multiple servers are configured to the relay agent, several
   Reconfigure-Request messages are to be built.  The behavior of the
   relay agent to disambiguate responses when multiple servers are
   configured is implementation specific.  For example, an
   implementation may generate a distinct "transaction-id" per server
   while another implementation may use the content of the "transaction-
   id" field and the Server Identifier Option to disambiguate the
   responses.

   The relay transmits Reconfigure-Request messages according to
   Section 14 of [RFC3315], using the following parameters:

     IRT (Initial retransmission time):      1 sec
     MRT (Maximum retransmission time):     10 secs
     MRC (Maximum retransmission count):     5
     MRD (Maximum retransmission duration):  0

   The relay MAY remove clients from the client identifier list in
   subsequent retransmissions, but MUST NOT add clients to the client
   identifier list.  This decision is local to the relay (e.g., it may
   be based on observed events such as one or more clients were
   reconfigured on their own).

   The relay may receive Reconfigure encapsulated in Relay-Reply before
   Reconfigure-Reply.  The relay SHOULD NOT interpret it as if the

RFC 6977         DHCPv6 Relay-Triggered Reconfiguration        July 2013


   Reconfigure-Request was successfully handled by the server.  The
   relay SHOULD use Reconfigure-Reply, not the Reconfigure message, to
   determine if the request was successful (see the discussion in
   Section 4).

6.4.  Intermediate Relay Agents Behavior

   The relay agent MUST be configurable to accept or reject Reconfigure-
   Request messages received from other relay agents.  If no indication
   is explicitly configured to the relay, the default behavior is to
   accept Reconfigure-Request messages.

   If the relay is configured not to allow Reconfigure-Request messages,
   the relay MUST silently discard any Reconfigure-Request message it
   receives.  If the relay is configured to accept Reconfigure-Request
   messages, these messages are relayed as specified in Section 20.1.1
   of [RFC3315].

6.5.  Server Behavior

   The server MUST be configurable to accept or reject Reconfigure-
   Request messages.  If no indication is explicitly configured to the
   server, the default behavior is to reject Reconfigure-Request
   messages.

   Upon receipt of a valid Reconfigure-Request message from a DHCPv6
   relay agent (see Section 6.2), the server determines the client(s)
   for which a Reconfigure message is to be sent.

   The server constructs a Reconfigure-Reply message by setting the
   "msg-type" field to RECONFIGURE-REPLY and copying the transaction ID
   from the Reconfigure-Request message into the "transaction-id" field.
   The server includes its server identifier in a Server Identifier
   Option.  The server MUST include a Status Code Option [RFC3315]
   indicating whether the request has been successfully processed,
   failed, or partially failed.

   o  If the server fails to process the request, the server MUST set
      the Status Code Option to the appropriate status code (e.g.,
      UnspecFail, NotAllowed, etc.).  In particular,

      *  UnspecFail MUST be returned if the Reconfigure-Request message
         is malformed.

      *  NotAllowed MUST be returned if the server is not configured to
         allow Reconfigure-Request.

RFC 6977         DHCPv6 Relay-Triggered Reconfiguration        July 2013


      *  NotConfigured MUST be returned if the server has no record of
         the link [RFC5007].

   o  If the Reconfigure-Request is successfully validated, the server
      MUST return a Status Code Option indicating "Success".  In
      addition, the server MUST include a list of all the Client
      Identifier Options of the clients to which Reconfigure messages
      will not be sent (e.g., the server has no record of the client or
      the client did not negotiate for Reconfigure support).  Note that
      this means that "Success" will be returned even if Reconfigure
      messages will not be sent to any of the clients.

   If RSOO is supplied, the server might use its content to double check
   whether a Reconfigure is required to be sent to the client.  This
   assumes the server stored the content of RSOO it used to generate the
   configuration data sent to requesting clients.

   The server might use the content of the Reconfigure Message Option
   supplied by the relay agent to determine which form of Reconfigure to
   use.

   Then, the server MUST follow the procedure defined in Section 19.1 of
   [RFC3315] to construct a Reconfigure message.

   Rate-limit considerations are discussed in Section 7.

6.6.  Receipt of a Reconfigure-Reply

   Depending on the status code enclosed in a received Reconfigure-Reply
   message, the relay may decide to terminate the request (e.g.,
   NotAllowed, NotConfigured, and Success) or try a different corrected
   Reconfigure-Request (e.g., UnspecFail).

   When multiple servers are configured, the relay should expect to
   receive several Reconfigure-Reply messages.  As mentioned in
   Section 6.3, the relay should be able to disambiguate these responses
   and associate them with a given server.  The relay agent assumes the
   request is successfully handled for a client if there is at least one
   Reconfigure-Reply message in which the corresponding Client
   Identifier Option does not appear.

7.  Rate-Limiting Considerations

   The relay MUST rate-limit Reconfigure-Request messages to be sent to
   the server.  The relay MUST be configured with required rate-limit
   parameters.  The maximum Reconfigure-Request packet size SHOULD be
   configurable and the default value MUST be 1280 octets.

RFC 6977         DHCPv6 Relay-Triggered Reconfiguration        July 2013


   The server MUST rate-limit Reconfigure messages triggered by
   Reconfigure-Request messages.  The server MUST be configured with
   required rate-limit parameters.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following new DHCPv6 Message types in the
   registry maintained in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

      RECONFIGURE-REQUEST

      RECONFIGURE-REPLY

   IANA has assigned the following new DHCPv6 Option Codes in the
   registry maintained in
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

      OPTION_LINK_ADDRESS

9.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations elaborated in [RFC3315] (in particular
   Section 21.1) and [RFC6422] must be taken into account.  In addition,
   DHCPv6 servers MAY be configured to reject relayed Reconfigure-
   Request messages or restrict relay chaining (see [RFC5007] for more
   discussion about the rationale of this recommended behavior).
   Section 6.5 specifies the error code to return when the server is
   configured to reject Reconfigure-Request messages.

   Relay agents SHOULD implement appropriate means to prevent using
   Reconfigure-Request messages as a denial-of-service attack on the
   DHCPv6 servers.

   Because the Reconfigure-Request message provides a mechanism for
   triggering the DHCPv6 Reconfigure message, and the DHCPv6 Reconfigure
   message can raise security threats (e.g., to control the timing of a
   DHCPv6 renewal), the DHCPv6 server MUST have some mechanism for
   determining that the relay agent is a trusted entity.  DHCPv6 servers
   and relay agents MUST implement relay message authentication as
   described in Section 21.1 of [RFC3315].  DHCPv6 servers MAY also
   implement a control policy based on the content of a received Relay
   Identifier Option [RFC5460].  Administrators are strongly advised to
   configure one of these security mechanisms.

   In an environment where the network connecting the relay agent to the
   DHCPv6 server is physically secure and does not contain devices not
   controlled by the server administrator, it may be sufficient to trust

   the Relay Agent Identifier provided by the relay agent.  In networks
   where the security of the machines with access to the data path is
   not under the control of the server administrator, IPsec [RFC4301] is
   necessary to prevent spoofing of Reconfigure-Request messages.
   DHCPv6 servers MUST silently discard Reconfigure-Request messages
   originating from unknown relay agents.
