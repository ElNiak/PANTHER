Abstract

   This document requests IANA registration of an Enumservice for XMPP,
   the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol.  This Enumservice
   specifically allows the use of 'xmpp' Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs) in the context of E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM).

RFC 4979                    XMPP Enumservice                 August 2007


1.  Introduction

   E.164 Number Mapping (ENUM) [1] uses the Domain Name System (DNS) [6]
   to refer from E.164 numbers [7] to Uniform Resource Identifiers
   (URIs) [3].  Specific services to be used with ENUM must be
   registered with IANA.  Section 3 of RFC 3761 describes the process of
   such an Enumservice registration.

   The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [9] provides
   means for streaming Extensible Markup Language (XML) [8] elements
   between endpoints in close to real time.  The XMPP framework is
   mainly used to provide instant messaging, presence, and streaming
   media services.

   RFC 4622 [5] registers a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for
   identifying an XMPP entity as a URI or as an Internationalized
   Resource Identifier (IRI) [4].  The Enumservice specified in this
   document allows the provisioning of such "xmpp" URIs (and the URI
   representations of "xmpp" IRIs) in ENUM.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

3.  Enumservice Registration - XMPP

   The following template contains information required for the IANA
   registrations of the 'XMPP' Enumservice, according to Section 3 of
   RFC 3761:

   Enumservice Name: "XMPP"

   Enumservice Type: "xmpp"

   Enumservice Subtype: n/a

   URI Schemes: "xmpp"

   Functional Specification:

      This Enumservice indicates that the resource identified is an XMPP
      entity.

   Security Considerations: see Section 6

   Intended Usage: COMMON

   Author: Alexander Mayrhofer <alexander.mayrhofer@enum.at>

4.  XMPP IRI/URI Considerations for ENUM

4.1.  Authority Component

   XMPP IRIs/URIs optionally contain an "Authority Component" (see
   Section 2.3 of RFC 4622).  The presence of such an Authority
   Component in an IRI/URI signals the processing application to
   authenticate as the user indicated in the URI/IRI rather than using
   the preconfigured identity.

   In the context of this Enumservice, arbitrary clients may discover
   and use the XMPP URIs/IRIs associated to an E.164 number.  Hence, in
   most cases, those clients will not be able to authenticate as
   requested in the Authority Component.

   Therefore, URIs/IRIs that result from processing an XMPP Enumservice
   record SHOULD NOT contain an Authority Component.

4.2.  IRI-to-URI mapping

   While XMPP supports IRIs as well as 'plain' URIs, ENUM itself
   supports only the use of URIs for Enumservices.

   Therefore, XMPP IRIs MUST be mapped to URIs for use in an XMPP
   Enumservice record.  The mapping MUST follow the procedures outlined
   in Section 3.1 of RFC 3987.

5.  Example

   An example ENUM entry referencing to a XMPP URI could look like:

             $ORIGIN 6.9.4.0.6.9.4.5.1.1.4.4.e164.arpa.
             @  IN NAPTR  ( 100 10 "u"
                            "E2U+xmpp"
                            "!^.*$!xmpp:some-user@example.com!" .
                          )

6.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   General security considerations of the protocols on which this
   Enumservice registration is based are addressed in Sections 3.1.3 and
   6 of RFC 3761 (ENUM) and Section 14 of RFC 3920 (XMPP).

   Since ENUM uses DNS -- a publicly available database -- any
   information contained in records provisioned in ENUM domains must be
   considered public as well.  Even after revoking the DNS entry and
   removing the referred resource, copies of the information could still
   be available.

   Information published in ENUM records could reveal associations
   between E.164 numbers and their owners -- especially if IRIs/URIs
   contain personal identifiers or domain names for which ownership
   information can be obtained easily.

   However, it is important to note that the ENUM record itself does not
   need to contain any personal information.  It just points to a
   location where access to personal information could be granted.

   ENUM records pointing to third-party resources can easily be
   provisioned on purpose by the ENUM domain owner -- so any assumption
   about the association between a number and an entity could therefore
   be completely bogus unless some kind of identity verification is in
   place.  This verification is out of scope for this memo.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests IANA to add a new "XMPP" Enumservice to the
   'Enumservice Registrations' registry, according to the definitions in
   this document and RFC 3761 [1].

   The required template is contained in Section 3.

8.  Acknowledgements

   Some text from RFC 4622 was used in the Introduction of this
   document.  Charles Clancy, Miguel Garcia, Andrew Newton, Jon
   Peterson, and Peter Saint-Andre provided extensive reviews and
   valuable feedback.
