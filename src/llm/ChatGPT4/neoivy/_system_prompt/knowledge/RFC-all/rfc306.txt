                          NETWORK HOST STATUS

   This RFC reports on the status of most Network Hosts from January 31
   to February 11.

   Several Hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing.  These
   Hosts fall into two categories:

      1)  Hosts which are not expected to be functioning on the Network
          as servers (available for use from other sites) on a regular
          basis for at least two weeks.  Included here are:

          NETWORK              SITE                COMPUTER
          ADDRESS

          133                  BBN                 PDP-10  (B)
          13                   Case                PDP-10
          15                   Ames/(Paoli)        ILLIAC/(B6500)

      2)  Hosts which are currently intended to be users only.  Included
          here are the Terminal IMPs, which are presently in the Network
          (AMES, MITRE, NBS and BBN*).  This category also includes the
          Network Control Center computer (Network Address 5) which is
          used solely for gathering statistics from the Network.
          Finally, included among these Hosts are the following:

          NETWORK              SITE                COMPUTER
          ADDRESS

          7                    Rand                IBM-360/65
          73                   Harvard             PDP-1
          12                   Illinois            PDP-11
          19                   NBS                 PDP-11

   The tables on the next two pages summarize the Host status for this
   period.

   ________
   *The BBN Terminal IMP (Network Address 158) is a prototype and as
   such is frequently not connected to the Network, but being used to
   refine and debug the Terminal IMP programs.

   where

   D = Dead (Destination Host either dead or inaccessible [due to
       network partitioning or local IMP failure] from the BBN Terminal
       IMP.)

   H = 1/2 Open (Destination Host opened a connection but then either
       immediately closed it, or did not respond any further.)

   O = Open (Destination Host opened a connection and was accessible to
       users.)

   R = Refused (Destination Host returned a CLS to the initial RFC.)

   T = Time out (Destination Host did not complete the ICP and open a
       connection within 60 seconds.)



   ________
   * The only service currently offered by the UCLA IBM-360/91 is a
   Network Job Service (NETRJS), however, the BBN Terminal IMP is not
   equipped to test NETRJS.  We are assuming that initial connection to
   the NETRJS logger indicates that NETRJS is also functioning.
