   DHCP Options for Home Information Discovery in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)

Abstract

   This document defines a DHCP-based scheme to enable dynamic discovery
   of Mobile IPv6 home network information.  New DHCP options are
   defined that allow a mobile node to request the home agent IP
   address, Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), or home network prefix
   and obtain it via the DHCP response.

RFC 6610         DHCPv6 for Home Info Discovery in MIPv6        May 2012


1.  Introduction

   Before a mobile node can engage in Mobile IPv6 signaling with a home
   agent, it should either know the IP address of the home agent via
   pre-configuration or dynamically discover it.  The Mobile IPv6
   specification [RFC6275] describes how home agents can be dynamically
   discovered by mobile nodes that know the home network prefix.  This
   scheme does not work when prefix information is not already available
   to the mobile node.  This document specifies extensions to DHCPv6
   [RFC3736] [RFC3315] to deliver the home agent information to the
   mobile node in the form of the IP address of the home agent or the
   Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) [RFC1035] of the home agent.  The
   information delivered to the mobile node may also include the home
   prefix for the mobile node.  The solution involves defining new DHCP
   options to carry home network prefixes, home agent IP addresses, and
   FQDN information.  The mobile node MAY also use the home prefix to
   discover the list of home agents serving the home prefix using the
   Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery mechanism specified in
   [RFC6275].

   As part of configuring the initial TCP/IP parameters, a mobile node
   can find itself a suitable home agent.  Such a home agent might
   reside in the access network to which the mobile node connects or in
   a home network with which the mobile node is associated.  A mobile
   node can indicate its home network identity when roaming to a visited
   network in order to obtain the MIPv6 bootstrap parameters from the
   home network.  As an example, the visited network may determine the
   home network of the mobile node based on the realm portion of the NAI
   (Network Access Identifier) [RFC4282] used in access authentication
   [RFC5447].

   The mobile node may or may not be connected to the "home" network
   when it attempts to learn Mobile IPv6 home network information.  This
   allows operators to centrally deploy home agents while being able to
   bootstrap mobile nodes that are already roaming.  This scenario also
   occurs when Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) [RFC5380] is used,
   where the mobile node is required to discover the MAP (a special home
   agent) that is located multiple hops away from the mobile node's
   attachment point.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

RFC 6610         DHCPv6 for Home Info Discovery in MIPv6        May 2012


   General mobility terminology can be found in [RFC3753].  The
   following additional terms, as defined in [RFC4640], are used in this
   document:

   Access Service Provider (ASP):  A network operator that provides
      direct IP packet forwarding to and from the mobile node.

   Mobility Service Provider (MSP):  A service provider that provides
      Mobile IPv6 service.  In order to obtain such service, the mobile
      node must be authenticated and authorized to use the Mobile IPv6
      service.

   Mobility Service Authorizer (MSA):  A service provider that
      authorizes Mobile IPv6 service.

3.  DHCP Options for Home Network/Agent Dynamic Discovery

   This section introduces new DHCP options that are used for dynamic
   discovery of the home agent's IPv6 address, IPv6 home network prefix,
   or FQDN information in Mobile IPv6.  Transport to a home agent over
   IPv4 is also supported by specifying an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address.
   The detailed procedures are described in Section 2.3.2 of "Mobile
   IPv6 Support for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers" [RFC5555].

   The names of options listed in this section all start with MIPv6, in
   order to differentiate them from other DHCP options that might have
   similar names.  However, throughout the rest of this document, the
   options are referred to by name without the MIPv6 prefix, for
   brevity.

3.1.  MIPv6 Home Network ID FQDN Option

   This option is used by mobile nodes to communicate to the DHCP server
   an FQDN that identifies the target home network for which the client
   is requesting configuration information.  When the mobile node
   requests configuration for more than one target home network, this
   option is also used by the server to identify the target home network
   for each Identified Home Network Information option returned.

   When a mobile node sends this option to request information about a
   specific home network, the option is simply included in the DHCP
   message from the mobile node.  When a server responds with an
   Identified Home Network Information option, this option MUST be
   encapsulated in the Identified Home Network Information option that
   it identifies.

RFC 6610         DHCPv6 for Home Info Discovery in MIPv6        May 2012


4.  Option Usage

   The requesting and sending of the proposed DHCP options follow the
   rules for DHCPv6 options in [RFC3315].

4.1.  Mobile Node Behavior

   Mobile nodes MAY obtain MIPv6 configuration information during either
   a stateful configuration exchange [RFC3315] or a stateless
   configuration exchange [RFC3736].

   Mobile nodes that obtain MIPv6 configuration information using a
   stateful configuration exchange SHOULD include the same options in
   every message they send to the DHCP server.

   Mobile nodes that obtain MIPv6 configuration using a stateless
   exchange MAY omit MIPv6 configuration from some exchanges, but SHOULD
   reconfigure whenever a change in the attached network is detected.
   If the DHCP server responds to a MIPv6-related stateless
   configuration request with an Information Request Timer option, the
   mobile node SHOULD attempt to reconfigure when the IRT expires.

   A mobile node using stateless configuration may try to perform home
   network information discovery when it lacks home network information
   for MIPv6 or needs to change the home agent for some reason.  For
   example, this may be necessary to recover from the failure of an
   existing home agent or to use the local home agent located in the
   network where the mobile node is currently attached.  Note that
   despite the home information discovery procedure, the mobile node may
   continue to use the old home agent, in order to avoid losing current
   sessions.

4.1.1.  Requesting MIPv6 Configuration

   Mobile nodes signal that they are interested in being configured with
   MIPv6 home agent information by requesting one or more of the three
   Home Network Information options: the Visited Home Network
   Information option, the Identified Home Network Information option,
   or the Unrestricted Home Network Information option.  To request
   these options, the client lists them in the Option Request Option
   (ORO).  A client that requests any of these three options in the ORO
   MUST also request the Home Network Identifier FQDN option, the Home
   Network Prefix option, the Home Agent Address option, and the Home
   Agent FQDN option.

   If the mobile node requests the Visited Home Network Information
   option, this indicates that it is interested in learning the home

RFC 6610         DHCPv6 for Home Info Discovery in MIPv6        May 2012


   network information that pertains to the currently visited network.
   This type can be used to discover local home agents in the local ASP.

   If the mobile node requests the Identified Home Network Information
   option, this indicates that it is interested in learning the home
   network information that pertains to a specified realm.  This type
   can be used to discover home agents that are hosted by a user's home
   domain or by any target domain.  A mobile node requesting the
   Identified Home Network Information option MUST include a Client Home
   Network ID FQDN option identifying the MSP being identified.  The
   target MSP can be a mobile node's home MSP or any MSP that has a
   trusted roaming relationship with the mobile node's MSA.

   If the mobile node has no preference as to the home network with
   which it should be configured, it SHOULD request the Unrestricted
   Home Network Information option, and SHOULD NOT request either the
   Visited Home Network Information option or the Identified Home
   Network Information option.

   A client that wishes to be configured with both the Visited Home
   Network Information option and the Identified Home Network
   Information option may request both options in the Option Request
   Option.  A client may request information about more than one
   identified domain by requesting the Identified Home Network
   Information option in the ORO and including more than one Home
   Network ID FQDN option.  A client that sends more than one Home
   Network ID FQDN option MUST request the Home Network ID option in the
   ORO.

4.1.2.  Processing MIPv6 Configuration Information

   DHCP Clients on mobile nodes should be prepared to receive any MIPv6
   Home Network Information options they request.  If more than one Home
   Network ID FQDN option was sent, the client should be prepared to
   handle zero or more Identified Home Network Information options in
   response; the DHCP server may not have configuration information for
   all targeted domains, or, indeed, for any.  If a misconfigured server
   returns an Identified Home Network Information option that does not
   contain a Home Network ID FQDN option corresponding to one that the
   client requested, the client MUST silently discard that Identified
   Home Network Information option.

   If any of the three Home Network Information options is returned,
   configuration information will be included within it.  The client
   must be prepared to handle home agent addresses in the form of either
   the Home Agent Address option or the Home Agent FQDN option.

RFC 6610         DHCPv6 for Home Info Discovery in MIPv6        May 2012


   If the client finds an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address in a Home Agent
   Address option, it may only use this address to communicate over
   IPv4.  If a Home Network Information option does not contain complete
   configuration information, the client MUST silently discard that Home
   Network Information option.

   If the client receives any Home Network ID FQDN options, Home Network
   Prefix options, Home Agent Address options, or Home Agent FQDN
   options that are not encapsulated in one of the three types of Home
   Network Information options, it MUST silently discard these options.

   The DHCP client must pass whatever configuration information it
   receives to the appropriate mobile IP implementation on the mobile
   node.  How this is done, and what the mobile IP implementation on the
   mobile node does with this information, is outside the scope of this
   document.

   As described later in this section, servers may provide more than one
   Home Network Information option or multiple Home Agent Prefix, Home
   Agent Address, or Home Agent FQDN options.  When provided with
   multiple Visited Home Network Information options or Unrestricted
   Home Network Information options of the same type, or with multiple
   sub-options within such an option, the mobile node SHOULD choose the
   first one that it can employ.

   If the DHCP client on a mobile node receives any Home Network Prefix
   options, Home Agent Address option, or Home Agent FQDN option that
   are not contained within Home Network Information options, the DHCP
   client MUST silently discard these options.

4.2.  Relay Agent Behavior

   In some cases, DHCP relay agents may have access to configuration
   information for the mobile node.  In such cases, relay agents MAY
   send Visited Home Network Information options, Identified Home
   Network Information options, and/or Unrestricted Home Network
   Information options to the DHCP server.  To do so, the relay agent
   MUST encapsulate these options in a Relay-Supplied Options option
   [RFC6422].  If the DHCP relay agent includes any Identified Home
   Network Information options, these options MUST correspond to home
   networks identified in Home Network ID FQDN options in the client
   request.  In addition, each Identified Home Network Information
   option must contain a Home Network ID FQDN option identical to the
   one sent by the client, to identify the network to the client.

   No special handling is required when processing relay-reply messages.

RFC 6610         DHCPv6 for Home Info Discovery in MIPv6        May 2012


4.3.  DHCP Server Behavior

   Generally, DHCP servers can simply be configured with Visited Home
   Network Information options, Identified Home Network Information
   options, and Unrestricted Home Network Information options.  In the
   case of Visited Home Network Information options and Unrestricted
   Home Network Information options, which clients get what options
   depends on operator configuration.

   A DHCP server MAY maintain a table of Home Network ID FQDNs.  For
   each such FQDN, a server that maintains such a table SHOULD include
   an Identified Home Network Information option.  Such a server would
   look up the FQDN from any Home Network ID FQDN options provided by
   the client in its table, and for each match, include the Identified
   Home Network Information option configured in the table entry for
   that FQDN.

   If a DHCP server does not implement the Home Network ID FQDN table,
   or some similar functionality, it is an error for the operator to
   configure it with any Identified Home Network Information options.
   These options could be erroneously forwarded to the client, which
   would have no use for them, and is required to discard them.

   DHCP servers that implement the Home Network ID FQDN table must, when
   sending an Identified Home Network Information option to the client,
   include a Home Network ID option within the Identified Home Network
   Information option that identifies the home network for which
   configuration information is being sent.

   Aside from the Home Network ID FQDN table, the actual behavior of the
   DHCP server with respect to MIPv6 configuration is simply in
   accordance with the DHCPv6 protocol specification [RFC3315] and
   depends on operator configuration.  No special processing is required
   for Visited Home Network Information options or Unrestricted Home
   Network Information options.

4.4.  Home Agent Discovery Using a Network Access Server

   [RFC5447] describes the complete procedure for home agent assignment
   among the mobile node, NAS (Network Access Server), DHCP, and
   Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) entities for the
   bootstrapping procedure in the integrated scenario.

   A NAS is assumed to be co-located with a DHCP relay agent or a DHCP
   server in this solution.  In a network where the NAS is not
   co-located with a DHCP relay or a server, the server may not be
   provided with the home network information from the NAS; therefore,

RFC 6610         DHCPv6 for Home Info Discovery in MIPv6        May 2012


   it may either fail to provide information or provide home information
   that has been pre-configured by the administrator or that is acquired
   through a mechanism that is not described in this document.

5.  Security Considerations

   Secure delivery of home agent and home network information from a
   DHCP server to the mobile node (DHCP client) relies on the same
   security as DHCP.  The particular option defined in this document
   does not have additional impact on DHCP security.

   Aside from the DHCP client-to-server interaction, an operator must
   also ensure secure delivery of mobile IP information to the DHCP
   server.  This is outside the scope of DHCP and the newly defined
   options.

   The mechanisms in this specification could be used by attackers to
   learn the addresses of home agents in the home network or to feed
   incorrect information to mobile nodes.

   The ability to learn addresses of nodes may be useful to attackers
   because brute-force scanning of the address space is not practical
   with IPv6.  Thus, they could benefit from any means that make mapping
   the networks easier.  For example, if a security threat targeted at
   routers or even home agents is discovered, having a simple mechanism
   to easily find out possible targets may prove to be an additional
   security risk.

   Apart from discovering the address(es) of home agents, attackers will
   not be able to learn much from this information, and mobile nodes
   cannot be tricked into using wrong home agents, as the actual
   communication with the home agents employs mutual authentication.

   The mechanisms from this specification may also leak interesting
   information about network topology and prefixes to attackers, and
   where there is no security to protect DHCP, even modify this
   information.  Again, the mobile nodes and home agents employ end-to-
   end security when they communicate with each other.  The authentic
   source of all information is that communication, not the information
   from DHCP.

   However, attacks against the information carried in DHCP may lead to
   denial of service if mobile nodes are unable to connect to any home
   agent, or choose a home agent that is not the most preferred one.

   registry maintained in

   http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters:

      49: OPTION_MIP6_HNIDF for the Home Network ID FQDN option

      50: OPTION_MIP6_VDINF for the Visited Home Network Information
          option

      69: OPTION_MIP6_IDINF for the Identified Home Network Information
          option

      70: OPTION_MIP6_UDINF for the Unrestricted Home Network
          Information option

      71: OPTION_MIP6_HNP for the Home Network Prefix option

      72: OPTION_MIP6_HAA for the Home Agent Address option

      73: OPTION_MIP6_HAF for the Home Agent FQDN option
