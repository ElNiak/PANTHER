1.  Introduction

   ATM-Based Multi-Pair Bonding, a.k.a. G.Bond/ATM, is specified in
   ITU-T Recommendation G.998.1 [G.998.1], which defines a method for
   bonding (or aggregating) multiple xDSL lines (or individual bearer
   channels in multiple xDSL lines) into a single bidirectional logical
   link carrying an ATM stream.

   This specification can be viewed as an evolution of the legacy
   Inverse Multiplexing for ATM (IMA) technology [AF-PHY-0086], applied
   to xDSL with variable rates on each line/bearer channel.  As with the
   other bonding schemes, ATM bonding also allows bonding of up to 32
   individual sub-layers with variable rates, providing common
   functionality for the configuration, initialization, operation, and
   monitoring of the bonded link.

   The MIB module defined in this document defines a set of managed
   objects for the management of G.998.1 bonded interfaces, extending
   the common objects specified in the GBOND-MIB module [RFC6765].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  The Broadband Forum Management Framework for xDSL Bonding

   This document makes use of the Broadband Forum technical report
   "Management Framework for xDSL Bonding" [TR-159], defining a
   management model and a hierarchy of management objects for the bonded
   xDSL interfaces.

4.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section outlines the relationship of the MIB modules defined in
   this document with other MIB modules described in the relevant RFCs.
   Specifically, the following MIB modules are discussed: the Interfaces
   Group MIB (IF-MIB) and the G.Bond MIB (GBOND-MIB).

4.1.  Relationship to Interfaces Group MIB Module

   A G.Bond/ATM port is a private case of a bonded multi-pair xDSL
   interface and as such is managed using generic interface management
   objects defined in the IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In particular, an interface
   index (ifIndex) is used to index instances of G.Bond/ATM ports, as
   well as xDSL lines/channels, in a managed system.

4.2.  Relationship to G.Bond MIB Module

   The GBOND-MIB module [RFC6765] defines management objects common for
   all bonded multi-pair xDSL interfaces.  In particular, it describes
   the bonding management, bonded port and channel configuration,
   initialization sequence, etc.



Beili                        Standards Track                    [Page 3]

RFC 6768                     G.Bond/ATM MIB                February 2013


   Both the GBOND-MIB and G9981-MIB modules are REQUIRED to manage a
   G.Bond/ATM port.

4.3.  Relationship to ATM MIB Module

   The ATM-MIB [RFC2515] module defines management objects for an ATM
   interface.

   The ATM-MIB module can be used to manage the ATM aspects of a G.Bond/
   ATM port.

5.  MIB Structure

5.1.  Overview

   All management objects defined in the G9981-MIB module are contained
   in a single group g9981Port.  This group is further split into 4
   sub-groups, structured as recommended by RFC 4181 [RFC4181]:

   o  g9981PortNotifications - containing notifications (Up/Downstream
      Differential Delay Tolerance Exceeded).

   o  g9981PortConfTable - containing objects for configuration of a
      G.Bond/ATM port.

   o  g9981PortStatusTable - containing objects providing overall status
      information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing the generic status
      information from the ifTable of the IF-MIB and the gBondFltStatus
      of the GBOND-MIB.

   o  g9981PM - containing objects providing historical Performance
      Monitoring (PM) information of a G.Bond/ATM port, complementing
      the PM information from the gBondPortPM of the GBOND-MIB.

   Note that the rest of the objects for the Generic Bonding Sub-layer
   (GBS) port configuration, capabilities, status, notifications, and
   Performance Monitoring are located in the GBOND-MIB module.

5.2.  Performance Monitoring

   The OPTIONAL Performance Monitoring counters, thresholds, and history
   buckets (interval-counters) are implemented using the textual
   conventions defined in the HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3705].  The
   HC-PerfHist-TC-MIB defines 64-bit versions of the textual conventions
   found in the PerfHist-TC-MIB [RFC3593].

RFC 6768                     G.Bond/ATM MIB                February 2013


   The agent SHOULD align the beginning of each interval to a fifteen-
   minute boundary of a wall clock.  Likewise, the beginning of each
   one-day interval SHOULD be aligned with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when a GBS is re-initialized, but rather only
   when the agent is reset or re-initialized.

   Note that the accumulation of certain performance events for a
   monitored entity is inhibited (counting stops) during periods of
   service unavailability on that entity.  The DESCRIPTION clause of
   Performance Monitoring counters in this MIB module specifies which of
   the counters are inhibited during periods of service unavailability.

5.3.  Mapping of Broadband Forum TR-159 Managed Objects

   This section contains the mapping between relevant managed objects
   (attributes) defined in [TR-159] and the managed objects defined in
   this document.

RFC 6768                     G.Bond/ATM MIB                February 2013


   Note that some of the mapping between the objects defined in TR-159
   and the ones defined in this MIB module is not one-to-one; for
   example, while TR-159 PM attributes aGroupPerf* map to the
   corresponding gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, there are
   no dedicated PM attributes for the g9981PortPm* objects introduced in
   this MIB module.  However, since their definition is identical to the
   definition of gBondPortPm* objects of the GBOND-MIB module, we can
   map g9981PortPm* to the relevant aGroupPerf* attributes of TR-159 and
   use the term 'partial mapping' to denote the fact that this mapping
   is not one-to-one.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of managed objects defined in this MIB module with
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support
   for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  Changing of g9981PortConfTable configuration parameters MAY lead
      to a potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) breach, for example,
      if a traffic delay is increased as a result of the higher delay
      tolerance (increased g9981PortConfUpDiffDelayTolerance and/or
      g9981PortConfDnDiffDelayTolerance), or the differential delay
      tolerance notifications are disabled by manipulating the
      g9981PortConfDiffDelayToleranceExceededEnable parameter.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments since, collectively, they
   provide information about the performance of network interfaces and
   can reveal some aspects of their configuration.

   It is thus important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to
   these objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these
   objects when sending them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

   IANA has assigned 208 as the object identifier for g9981MIB
   MODULE-IDENTITY in the MIB-2 transmission sub-tree
