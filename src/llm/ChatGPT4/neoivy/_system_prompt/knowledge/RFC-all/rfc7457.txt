      Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                        and Datagram TLS (DTLS)

Abstract

   Over the last few years, there have been several serious attacks on
   Transport Layer Security (TLS), including attacks on its most
   commonly used ciphers and modes of operation.  This document
   summarizes these attacks, with the goal of motivating generic and
   protocol-specific recommendations on the usage of TLS and Datagram
   TLS (DTLS).

RFC 7457                       TLS Attacks                 February 2015


1.  Introduction

   Over the last few years, there have been several major attacks on TLS
   [RFC5246], including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and
   modes of operation.  Details are given in Section 2, but a quick
   summary is that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most
   current usage, have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.

   This situation was one of the motivations for the creation of the UTA
   working group, which was tasked with the creation of generic and
   protocol-specific recommendations for the use of TLS and DTLS
   [RFC6347] (unless otherwise noted under Section 3, all of the
   information provided in this document applies to DTLS).

   There is an old saying attributed, ironically enough, to the US
   National Security Agency (NSA): "Attacks always get better; they
   never get worse."  Unfortunately, that saying is true, so any
   description of security attacks can only be a snapshot in time.
   Therefore this document reflects our knowledge as of this writing.
   It seems likely that new attacks will be discovered in the future.

   For a more detailed discussion of the attacks listed here, the
   interested reader is referred to [Attacks-iSec].

2.  Attacks on TLS

   This section lists the attacks that motivated the current
   recommendations in [SECURE-TLS].  This list is not intended to be an
   extensive survey of the security of TLS.

   While there are widely deployed mitigations for some of the attacks
   listed below, we believe that their root causes necessitate a more
   systematic solution, which we have attempted to develop in
   [SECURE-TLS].

   When an identifier exists for an attack, we have included its Common
   Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID.  CVE [CVE] is an extensive,
   industry-wide database of software vulnerabilities.

2.1.  SSL Stripping

   Various attacks attempt to remove the use of Secure Socket Layer /
   Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) altogether by modifying
   unencrypted protocols that request the use of TLS, specifically
   modifying HTTP traffic and HTML pages as they pass on the wire.
   These attacks are known collectively as "SSL Stripping" (a form of
   the more generic "downgrade attack") and were first introduced by
   Moxie Marlinspike [SSL-Stripping].  In the context of Web traffic,



Sheffer, et al.               Informational                     [Page 3]

RFC 7457                       TLS Attacks                 February 2015


   these attacks are only effective if the client initially accesses a
   Web server using HTTP.  A commonly used mitigation is HTTP Strict
   Transport Security (HSTS) [RFC6797].

2.2.  STARTTLS Command Injection Attack (CVE-2011-0411)

   Similarly, there are attacks on the transition between unprotected
   and TLS-protected traffic.  A number of IETF application protocols
   have used an application-level command, usually STARTTLS, to upgrade
   a cleartext connection to use TLS.  Multiple implementations of
   STARTTLS had a flaw where an application-layer input buffer retained
   commands that were pipelined with the STARTTLS command, such that
   commands received prior to TLS negotiation are executed after TLS
   negotiation.  This problem is resolved by requiring the application-
   level command input buffer to be empty before negotiating TLS.  Note
   that this flaw lives in the application layer code and does not
   impact the TLS protocol directly.

   STARTTLS and similar mechanisms are vulnerable to downgrade attacks,
   whereby the attacker simply removes the STARTTLS indication from the
   (unprotected) request.  This cannot be mitigated unless HSTS-like
   solutions are added.

2.3.  BEAST (CVE-2011-3389)

   The BEAST attack [BEAST] uses issues with the TLS 1.0 implementation
   of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) (that is, the predictable
   initialization vector) to decrypt parts of a packet, and specifically
   to decrypt HTTP cookies when HTTP is run over TLS.

2.4.  Padding Oracle Attacks

   A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design in all current versions
   of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks [Padding-Oracle].
   A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen attack
   (CVE-2013-0169) [CBC-Attack], a timing side-channel attack that
   allows the attacker to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.

   The Lucky Thirteen attack can be mitigated by using authenticated
   encryption like AES-GCM [RFC5288] or encrypt-then-MAC [RFC7366]
   instead of the TLS default of MAC-then-encrypt.

   An even newer variant of the padding oracle attack, one that does not
   use timing information, is the POODLE attack (CVE-2014-3566) [POODLE]
   on SSL 3.0.  This attack has no known mitigation.

RFC 7457                       TLS Attacks                 February 2015


2.5.  Attacks on RC4

   The RC4 algorithm [RC4] has been used with TLS (and previously, SSL)
   for many years.  RC4 has long been known to have a variety of
   cryptographic weaknesses, e.g., [RC4-Attack-Pau], [RC4-Attack-Man],
   and [RC4-Attack-FMS].  Recent cryptanalysis results [RC4-Attack-AlF]
   exploit biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted
   plaintexts.

   These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically
   exploitable; currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30
   encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a
   sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.  For further details,
   the reader is referred to [CIPHER-SUITES] and the references it
   cites.

2.6.  Compression Attacks: CRIME, TIME, and BREACH

   The CRIME attack [CRIME] (CVE-2012-4929) allows an active attacker to
   decrypt ciphertext (specifically, cookies) when TLS is used with TLS-
   level compression.

   The TIME attack [TIME] and the later BREACH attack [BREACH] (CVE-
   2013-3587, though the number has not been officially allocated) both
   make similar use of HTTP-level compression to decrypt secret data
   passed in the HTTP response.  We note that compression of the HTTP
   message body is much more prevalent than compression at the TLS
   level.

   The TIME attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS compression.  We
   are not aware of mitigations at the TLS protocol level to the BREACH
   attack, and so application-level mitigations are needed (see
   [BREACH]).  For example, implementations of HTTP that use Cross-Site
   Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens will need to randomize them.  Even the
   best practices and recommendations from [SECURE-TLS] are insufficient
   to thwart this attack.

2.7.  Certificate and RSA-Related Attacks

   There have been several practical attacks on TLS when used with RSA
   certificates (the most common use case).  These include
   [Bleichenbacher98] and [Klima03].  While the Bleichenbacher attack
   has been mitigated in TLS 1.0, the Klima attack, which relies on a
   version-check oracle, is only mitigated by TLS 1.1.

   The use of RSA certificates often involves exploitable timing issues
   [Brumley03] (CVE-2003-0147), unless the implementation takes care to
   explicitly eliminate them.

RFC 7457                       TLS Attacks                 February 2015


   A recent certificate fuzzing tool [Brubaker2014using] uncovered
   numerous vulnerabilities in different TLS libraries related to
   certificate validation.

2.8.  Theft of RSA Private Keys

   When TLS is used with most non-Diffie-Hellman cipher suites, it is
   sufficient to obtain the server's private key in order to decrypt any
   sessions (past and future) that were initiated with that server.
   This technique is used, for example, by the popular Wireshark network
   sniffer to inspect TLS-protected connections.

   It is known that stolen (or otherwise obtained) private keys have
   been used as part of large-scale monitoring [RFC7258] of certain
   servers.

   Such attacks can be mitigated by better protecting the private key,
   e.g., using OS protections or dedicated hardware.  Even more
   effective is the use of cipher suites that offer "forward secrecy",
   the property where revealing a secret such as a private key does not
   expose past or future sessions to a passive attacker.

2.9.  Diffie-Hellman Parameters

   TLS allows the definition of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DH) and
   Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman parameters in its respective key
   exchange modes.  This results in an attack detailed in
   [Cross-Protocol].  Using predefined DH groups, as proposed in
   [FFDHE-TLS], would mitigate this attack.

   In addition, clients that do not properly verify the received
   parameters are exposed to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
   Unfortunately, the TLS protocol does not mandate this verification
   (see [RFC6989] for analogous information for IPsec).

2.10.  Renegotiation (CVE-2009-3555)

   A major attack on the TLS renegotiation mechanism applies to all
   current versions of the protocol.  The attack and the TLS extension
   that resolves it are described in [RFC5746].

2.11.  Triple Handshake (CVE-2014-1295)

   The triple handshake attack [BhargavanDFPS14] enables the attacker to
   cause two TLS connections to share keying material.  This leads to a
   multitude of attacks, e.g., man-in-the-middle, breaking safe
   renegotiation, and breaking channel binding via TLS Exporter
   [RFC5705] or "tls-unique" [RFC5929].

RFC 7457                       TLS Attacks                 February 2015


2.12.  Virtual Host Confusion

   A recent article [Delignat14] describes a security issue whereby
   SSLv3 fallback and improper handling of session caches on the server
   side can be abused by an attacker to establish a malicious connection
   to a virtual host other than the one originally intended and approved
   by the server.  This attack is especially serious in performance
   critical environments where sharing of SSLv3 session caches is very
   common.

2.13.  Denial of Service

   Server CPU power has progressed over the years so that TLS can now be
   turned on by default.  However, the risk of malicious clients and
   coordinated groups of clients ("botnets") mounting denial-of-service
   attacks is still very real.  TLS adds another vector for
   computational attacks, since a client can easily (with little
   computational effort) force the server to expend relatively large
   computational work.  It is known that such attacks have in fact been
   mounted.

2.14.  Implementation Issues

   Even when the protocol is properly specified, this does not guarantee
   the security of implementations.  In fact, there are very common
   issues that often plague TLS implementations.  In particular, when
   integrating into higher-level protocols, TLS and its PKI-based
   authentication are sometimes the source of misunderstandings and
   implementation "shortcuts".  An extensive survey of these issues can
   be found in [Georgiev2012].

   o  Implementations might omit validation of the server certificate
      altogether.  For example, this is true of the default
      implementation of HTTP client libraries in Python 2 (e.g., CVE-
      2013-2191).

   o  Implementations might not validate the server identity.  This
      validation typically amounts to matching the protocol-level server
      name with the certificate's Subject Alternative Name field.  Note:
      this same information is often also found in the Common Name part
      of the Distinguished Name, and some validators incorrectly
      retrieve it from there instead of from the Subject Alternative
      Name.

   o  Implementations might validate the certificate chain incorrectly
      or not at all, or use an incorrect or outdated trust anchor list.





Sheffer, et al.               Informational                     [Page 7]

RFC 7457                       TLS Attacks                 February 2015


   An implementation attack of a different kind, one that exploits a
   simple coding mistake (bounds check), is the Heartbleed attack (CVE-
   2014-0160) that affected a wide swath of the Internet when it was
   discovered in April 2014.

2.15.  Usability

   Many TLS endpoints, such as browsers and mail clients, allow the user
   to explicitly accept an invalid server certificate.  This often takes
   the form of a UI dialog (e.g., "do you accept this server?"), and
   users have been conditioned to respond in the affirmative in order to
   allow the connection to take place.

   This user behavior is used by (arguably legitimate) "SSL proxies"
   that decrypt and re-encrypt the TLS connection in order to enforce
   local security policy.  It is also abused by attackers whose goal is
   to gain access to the encrypted information.

   Mitigation is complex and will probably involve a combination of
   protocol mechanisms (HSTS, certificate pinning [KEY-PINNING]), and
   very careful UI design.

3.  Applicability to DTLS

   DTLS [RFC4347] [RFC6347] is an adaptation of TLS for UDP.

   With respect to the attacks described in the current document, DTLS
   1.0 is equivalent to TLS 1.1.  The only exception is RC4, which is
   disallowed in DTLS.  DTLS 1.2 is equivalent to TLS 1.2.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document describes protocol attacks in an informational manner
   and in itself does not have any security implications.  Its companion
   documents, especially [SECURE-TLS], certainly do.
