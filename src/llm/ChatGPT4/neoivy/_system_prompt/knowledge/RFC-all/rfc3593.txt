RFC 3593        15 Minute Based Performance History TCs   September 2003


1.  Introduction

   In cases where a manager must obtain performance history data about
   the behavior of equipment it manages, several strategies can be
   followed in the design of a MIB that represents the managed
   equipment, including:

   0  The agent counts events on a continuous basis and, whenever
      desired, the manager obtains the value of the event counter and
      adjusts its understanding of the history of events at the agent.

   0  The agent allocates events to 'buckets' where each bucket
      represents an interval of time.

   Telecommunications equipment often makes use of the latter strategy.
   See [3][4][5][7][8] for examples.  In particular, for this equipment
   it is common that history data is maintained by the agent in terms of
   fifteen minute intervals.

   This memo does not attempt to compare the relative merits of
   different strategies used to obtain history data.  Differences may
   include polling policy, the amount of management traffic between
   manager and agent, agent simplicity, and 'data currentness' of the
   data obtained by the manager.  MIB designers should consider these
   aspects when choosing a particular strategy in a MIB design.
   Instead, this memo provides definitions that can be used in MIB
   modules that require history data based on fifteen minute intervals.

   When designing a MIB module, it is often useful to define new types
   similar to those defined in the SMI [2].  In comparison to a type
   defined in the SMI, each of these new types has a different name, a
   similar syntax, but more precise semantics.  These newly defined
   types are termed textual conventions, and are used for the
   convenience of humans reading the MIB module.  This is done through
   Textual Conventions as defined in RFC 2579 [1].  It is the purpose of
   this document to define the set of textual conventions to be used
   when performance history based on 15 minute intervals is kept.  The
   performance history textual conventions defined in this memo are
   based on 32 bit counts.  For high capacity performance history counts
   see [9].

2.  Note on Invalid Data and Proxies

   In this document, the word proxy indicates an application which
   receives SNMP messages and replies to them on behalf of the devices
   where the actual implementation resides, e.g., DS3/E3 interfaces.
   The proxy will have already collected the information about the
   DS3/E3 interfaces into its local database and may not necessarily



Tesink                      Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 3593        15 Minute Based Performance History TCs   September 2003


   forward requests to the actual DS3/E3 interface.  It is expected in
   such an application that there are periods of time where the proxy is
   not communicating with the DS3/E3 interfaces.  In these instances,
   the proxy will not necessarily have up-to-date configuration
   information, and will most likely have missed the collection of some
   data.  Missed data collection may result in some intervals in the
   interval table being unavailable.

3.  Note on xyzTimeElapsed

   While xyzTimeElapsed is defined as having a maximum, there may be
   cases (e.g., an adjustment in the system's time-of-day clock) where
   the actual value of the current interval would exceed this maximum
   value.

   Suppose that an agent which aligns its 15-minute measurement
   intervals to 15-minute time-of-day ("wall clock") boundaries has a
   time-of-day clock that systematically gains time, and that a manager
   periodically corrects the clock by setting it back.

   It is assumed that the agent's time-of-day clock is reasonably
   accurate, say within a few seconds per day.  Thus, the manager's
   periodic clock adjustments will normally be small, and if done
   frequently enough, need not ever exceed 10 seconds.  In this case,
   all interval durations will be within the allowed tolerance and none
   need be marked invalid, _if_ the ANSI procedure of ending measurement
   intervals at 15-minute time-of-day boundaries is followed [6].

   If the time-of-day clock is systematically adjusted in small
   increments, then always ending measurement intervals at 15-minute
   time-of-day boundaries will result, in the long term, in the correct
   number of intervals with the correct average duration, irrespective
   of whether the clock is moved ahead or moved back.  Thus, if for some
   reason, such as an adjustment in the system's time-of-day clock, the
   current interval exceeds the maximum value, it is considered
   acceptable that the agent will return the maximum value.

4.  Note on xyzValidIntervals

   The overall constraint on <n> is 1 =< n =< 96.  Any additional
   constraints on n must be defined in the DESCRIPTION clause (e.g., see
   [5]).
