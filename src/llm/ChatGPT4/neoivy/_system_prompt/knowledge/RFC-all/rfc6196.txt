1.  Introduction and Overview

   RFC 1738 [RFC1738] registers the mailserver: URI scheme as
   provisional in the IANA URI registry defined by [RFC4395], defining
   it as "Access to data available from mail servers" with no further
   details provided.  The author of this document is not aware of any
   other more detailed definition of the mailserver: URI scheme.  The
   mailserver: URI scheme as currently specified is not interoperable.
   There is a small risk that somebody would decide to implement this
   scheme by looking at IANA's URI scheme registry, possibly inventing
   some undocumented syntax for it.  In order to minimize such risk,
   this document discourages any future implementations of this URI
   scheme and asks IANA to mark it as Historic in the URI scheme
   registry.

   There were some previous attempts to provide detailed documentation
   of the mailserver: URI scheme, but those efforts were not successful.
   Implementors interested in providing instructions for generating an
   email [RFC5322] message can instead use the mailto: URI scheme
   [RFC6068].  Implementors interested in referencing a message or a set
   of messages available from a mailstore over IMAP [RFC3501], POP
   [RFC1939], or web [RFC2616] can instead use the imap: [RFC5092], pop:
   [RFC2384] or http: [RFC2616] URIs, respectively.

2.  Security Considerations

   In the past, the mailserver: URI scheme was never properly documented
   and thus doesn't interoperate.  There are no known implementations of
   this URI scheme.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has re-registered the mailserver: URI scheme as Historic in the
   URI scheme registry and updated the reference to point to this
   document.
