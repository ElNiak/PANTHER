Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for Simple
   Network Management Protocol (SNMP) based event notification
   management of Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification
   (DOCSIS) compliant Cable Modems and Cable Modem Termination Systems.
   This MIB is defined as an extension to the DOCSIS Cable Device MIB.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
   Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2).  The set of
   objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP
   standards.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [2], STD 58, RFC 2579 [3] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [4].

2.  Glossary

   The terms in this document are derived either from normal cable
   system usage, or from the documents associated with the Data Over
   Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) process.

RFC 4547                 Event Notification MIB                June 2006


2.1.  BPI - Baseline Privacy Interface

   A mechanism for providing data privacy over the HFC network in DOCSIS
   1.0 systems [8].

2.2.  BPI - Baseline Privacy Plus Interface

   A mechanism that extends the Baseline Privacy Interface with the
   addition of CM authentication over the HFC network in DOCSIS 1.1/2.0
   systems and beyond [9].

2.3.  CATV

   Originally "Community Antenna Television", now used to refer to any
   cable or hybrid fiber and cable system used to deliver video signals
   to a community.

2.4.  CM - Cable Modem

   A CM acts as a "slave" station in a DOCSIS-compliant cable data
   system.

2.5.  CMTS - Cable Modem Termination System

   A generic term covering a cable bridge or cable router in a head-end.
   A CMTS acts as the master station in a DOCSIS-compliant cable data
   system.  It is the only station that transmits downstream, and it
   controls the scheduling of upstream transmissions by its associated
   CMs.

2.6.  DOCSIS

   DOCSIS stands for "Data-over-Cable Service Interface Specifications"
   and refers to the ITU-T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem
   systems [10], [13] commonly known as DOCSIS 1.0.  The DOCSIS 1.1
   specification is an extension of DOCSIS 1.0, with new features to
   support quality of service, fragmentation, and requirements for
   European cable plants [14].

   DOCSIS 2.0 [15] builds upon DOCSIS 1.1 and provides all of the
   features and functionality that DOCSIS 1.1 provides.  In addition, it
   provides some significant enhancements in upstream capacity over
   DOCSIS 1.1, such as 30.72 Mbps maximum upstream channel capacity,
   Synchronous-Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) operation, increased
   robustness to upstream noise and channel impairments, Enhanced Reed-
   Solomon error correction, and Trellis Coded Modulation.

RFC 4547                 Event Notification MIB                June 2006


2.7.  Downstream

   The direction from the CMTS to the CM.

2.8.  Head-end

   The origination point in most cable systems of the subscriber video
   signals.  Generally also the location of the CMTS equipment.

2.9.  MAC Packet

   A term referring to DOCSIS Protocol Data Unit (PDU).

2.10.  RF

   A term referring to Radio Frequency.

2.11.  SID

   A term referring to DOCSIS Service ID.  The SID identifies a
   particular upstream bandwidth allocation and class-of-service
   management for DOCSIS, and identifies a particular bidirectional
   security association for BPI.

2.12.  TLV

   TLV stands for Type/Length/Value.  TLV is an encoding method
   consisting of three fields.  The first field indicates the type of
   element, the second field indicates the length of the element, and
   the third field contains the element's value.

2.13.  Upstream

   The direction from the CM to the CMTS.

3.  Overview

   Offering High Speed Internet Service in the cable industry has become
   extremely successful.  DOCSIS devices are being deployed at a rate of
   multiple thousands per day.  Although operators are enjoying
   successful deployment, they are also facing the challenge of properly
   managing deployed devices.  Operators are using Simple Network
   Management Protocol, a set of Management Information Base (MIB)
   required by DOCSIS, and SNMP Notifications to manage deployed DOCSIS
   devices.  The usage of SNMP Notification for event reporting is
   becoming more popular as an effective and efficient method for
   network monitoring.

RFC 4547                 Event Notification MIB                June 2006


   Unfortunately, only a minimal set of SNMP Notifications is currently
   available.  This notification MIB, in conjunction with [11] and [12],
   provides a minimum set of standard DOCSIS Notifications that DOCSIS
   devices SHOULD support to enable successful management of DOCSIS
   devices and networks.

   This document defines a set of objects required for the event
   notification management of DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modems (CMs) and
   Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTSs).  The MIB module is derived
   from the DOCSIS [11] and [12].

   Appendix H of [11] defines all DOCSIS 1.1 required events, and
   Appendix D of [12] does that for DOCSIS 2.0.  The notifications
   specified in this document are used to notify these events via SNMP.

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3.1.  Structure of the MIB

   This DOCS-IETF-CABLE-DEVICE-NOTIFICATION-MIB was designed to extend
   the RFC2669 [5] notification module.

   Two groups of SNMP notification objects are defined in this document.
   One group defines notifications for cable modem events, and the other
   group defines notifications for cable modem termination system
   events.

   DOCSIS defines numerous events, and each event is assigned to a
   functional category.  This MIB defines a notification object for each
   functional category.  The varbinding list of each notification
   includes information about the event that occurred on the device.

4.  Definitions

   The MIB module defined here IMPORTs from SNMPv2-SMI [2], SNMPv2-CONF
   [3], DOCS-CABLE-DEVICE-MIB [5], DOCS-IF-MIB [6], and IF-MIB [7].

               "The Event Notification MIB is an extension of the
               CABLE DEVICE MIB.  It defines various notification
               objects for both cable modem and cable modem termination
               systems.  Two groups of SNMP notification objects are

6.  Acknowledgements

   This document was produced by the IPCDN Working Group.  Thanks to
   Harrie Hazewinkel and Bert Wijnen for their thorough review and
   insightful comments on this document.  Special thanks to Rich Woundy,
   who made several valuable suggestions to improve the notifications.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are two management objects defined in this MIB module with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create
   (docsDevCmNotifControl and docsDevCmtsNotifControl).  Such objects
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Setting docsDevCmNotifControl or docsDevCmtsNotifControl may cause
   flooding of notifications, which can disrupt network service.
   Besides causing "flooding", changing the objects can also mean that
   notifications will not be emitted when one intends that to happen.

   This MIB defines a number of notification objects that send detailed
   information about the event that caused the generation of the
   notification.  Information in the notification message includes:
   event priority, the event Id, the event message body, the CM DOCSIS
   capability, the CM DOCSIS QOS level, the CM DOCSIS upstream
   modulation type, the cable interface MAC address of the cable modem,
   and the cable card MAC address of the CMTS to which the modem is
   connected.  The monitoring of these notification messages could be
   used to gather information about the state of the network and devices
   (CM and CMTS) attached to the network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [16], section 8), including
   full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an

   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module defined in this document uses the following IANA-
   assigned OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers
   registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------
   docsDevNotifMIB   { mib-2 132 }
