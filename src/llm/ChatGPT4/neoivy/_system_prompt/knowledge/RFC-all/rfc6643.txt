  Translation of Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)
                      MIB Modules to YANG Modules

Abstract

   YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration and
   state data manipulated by the Network Configuration Protocol
   (NETCONF), NETCONF remote procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications.
   The Structure of Management Information (SMIv2) defines fundamental
   data types, an object model, and the rules for writing and revising
   MIB modules for use with the Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP).  This document defines a translation of SMIv2 MIB modules
   into YANG modules, enabling read-only (config false) access to data
   objects defined in SMIv2 MIB modules via NETCONF.

RFC 6643              Translation of SMIv2 to YANG             July 2012


1.  Introduction

   This document describes a translation of SMIv2 [RFC2578], [RFC2579],
   [RFC2580] MIB modules into YANG [RFC6020] modules, enabling read-only
   (config false, as defined in Section 7.19.1 of RFC 6020) access to
   SMIv2 objects defined in SMIv2 MIB modules via NETCONF [RFC6241].
   For a discussion why SMIv2 read-write or read-create objects are
   translated to read-only (config false) YANG objects, see Section 11.

   YANG modules generated from SMIv2 modules should not be modified.
   Any necessary changes should be made by modifying the original SMIv2
   modules (with proper updates of the SMIv2 LAST-UPDATED and REVISION
   clauses) and then running the translation defined in this memo again.
   Note that this does not affect the usage of YANG augments and or YANG
   deviations: YANG modules generated from SMIv2 modules can be
   augmented like any other YANG module, and YANG deviations can be used
   to document how an implementation deviates from the generated YANG
   module.

   SMIv1 modules can be converted to YANG by first following the rules
   in [RFC3584] to convert the SMIv1 module to SMIv2 and then following
   the rules in this document to convert the obtained SMIv2 module to
   YANG.

   The SMIv2-to-YANG mapping is illustrated by examples showing the
   translation of parts of the IF-MIB [RFC2863], the DIFFSERV-MIB
   [RFC3289], and the RMON2-MIB [RFC4502] SMIv2 modules.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119].

2.  Mapping of Well-Known Types

   The SMIv2 base types and some well-known derived textual conventions
   are mapped to YANG types according to Appendix A.  The mapping of the
   OCTET STRING depends on the context.  If an OCTET STRING type has an
   associated DISPLAY-HINT, then the corresponding YANG base type is the
   string type.  An implementation MUST format an OCTET STRING value
   according to the DISPLAY-HINT, as described in RFC 2579.  If an
   OCTECT STRING type does not have an associated DISPLAY-HINT, the
   binary type is used.  Similarly, the mapping of the INTEGER type
   depends on its usage as an enumeration or a 32-bit integral type.
   Implementations should provide implementation-specific options to
   handle situations where DISPLAY- HINTs are added during a revision of
   a module and backwards compatibility must be preserved, i.e., an
   added DISPLAY-HINT needs to be ignored.

RFC 6643              Translation of SMIv2 to YANG             July 2012


   The mappings shown in Appendix A may require to import the ietf-yang-
   types, ietf-inet-types, or ietf-yang-smiv2 YANG modules since some
   SMIv2 types and textual conventions map to YANG types defined in the
   ietf-yang-types and ietf-inet-types YANG modules defined in [RFC6021]
   and the ietf-yang-smiv2 YANG module defined in this document.
   Implementations MUST add any additional imports required by the type
   mapping.

3.  Translation of SMIv2 Modules and SMIv2 IMPORT Clauses

   SMIv2 modules are mapped to corresponding YANG modules.  The
   generated YANG module name MUST be the same as the SMIv2 module name.

   The YANG namespace MUST be constructed out of the IANA-registered
   prefix urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:smiv2: (see Section 12) followed
   by the SMIv2 module name.  Since SMIv2 module names can be assumed to
   be unique (see Section 3 in [RFC2578]), the resulting YANG namespace
   is unique.

   The YANG prefix MAY be derived from the SMIv2 module name using the
   module prefix generation algorithm described in Appendix B.  The YANG
   prefix is supposed to be short, and it must be unique within the set
   of all prefixes used by a YANG module.  The algorithm described in
   Appendix B generates such prefixes.

   SMIv2 IMPORT clauses are translated to YANG import statements.  One
   major difference between the SMIv2 import mechanism and the YANG
   import mechanism is that SMIv2 IMPORT clauses import specific symbols
   from an SMIv2 module, while the YANG import statement imports all
   symbols of the referenced YANG module.

   In order to produce correct and complete YANG import statements, the
   following rules MUST be used:

   o  Process each item in each SMIv2 IMPORT clause as follows:

      1.  If an import statement for this SMIv2 module has already been
          generated, then ignore this item.

      2.  Otherwise, if the SMIv2 module name is SNMPv2-SMI or SNMPv2-
          CONF, then ignore this item.  Note that these two modules can
          be completely ignored since all definitions in these modules
          are translated by translation rules.

      3.  Otherwise, if this item is a textual convention matching one
          of the textual conventions in the SMIv2 types column of
          Appendix A (e.g., MacAddress, PhysAddress, or TimeStamp) then
          ignore this item.

RFC 6643              Translation of SMIv2 to YANG             July 2012


      4.  Otherwise, if the item is used in a SYNTAX clause of an
          OBJECT-TYPE whose MAX-ACCESS is not accessible-for-notify,
          then generate an import statement as described below.

      5.  Otherwise, if the item is used in an OBJECTS clause of a
          NOTIFICATION-TYPE, then generate an import statement as
          described below.

      6.  Otherwise, if the item is used in an INDEX or AUGMENTS clause,
          then generate an import statement as described below.

      7.  Otherwise, ignore this item.  Some examples of this case are
          OBJECT IDENTIFIER assignments and objects that are only
          referenced in MODULE-COMPLIANCE, OBJECT-GROUP, or
          NOTIFICATION-GROUP clauses.

   o  Generate any additional import statements as required by the type
      translations according to the type mapping table Appendix A.  This
      requires the translator to consider all the types used in the
      SMIv2 module in order to produce the imports.

   o  Generate an import statement for the YANG module ietf-yang-smiv2
      with the prefix smiv2.

   The generated import statements use the untranslated SMIv2 module
   names or the names of well-known YANG modules as their argument.  The
   import statement must contain a prefix statement.  The prefixes MAY
   be generated by applying the module prefix generation algorithm
   described in Appendix B.

3.1.  Example: IMPORTS of IF-MIB

   The translation of the IF-MIB [RFC2863] leads to the YANG module and
   namespace/prefix statement and the import statements shown below.
   The prefix is the translation of the SMIv2 module name IF-MIB to
   lowercase (consisting of two tokens and thus no further
   abbreviation).

     module IF-MIB {

       namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:smiv2:IF-MIB";
       prefix "if-mib";

       import IANAifType-MIB      { prefix "ianaiftype-mib"; }
       import SNMPv2-TC           { prefix "snmpv2-tc"; }
       import ietf-yang-types     { prefix "yang"; }
       import ietf-yang-smiv2     { prefix "smiv2"; }
     }

4.  Translation of the MODULE-IDENTITY Macro

   SMIv2 requires an invocation of the MODULE-IDENTITY macro to provide
   contact and revision history for a MIB module.  The clauses of the
   SMIv2 MODULE-IDENTITY macro MUST be translated into YANG statements
   as detailed below.

4.1.  MODULE-IDENTITY Translation Rules

   o  The SMIv2 ORGANIZATION clause is mapped to the YANG organization
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 CONTACT-INFO clause is mapped to the YANG contact
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 DESCRIPTION clause is mapped to the YANG description
      statement.

   o  Each SMIv2 REVISION clause is mapped to a YANG revision statement.
      The revision is identified by the date argument of the SMIv2
      REVISION clause.  DESCRIPTION sub-clauses of REVISION clauses are
      mapped to corresponding description statement nested in revision
      clauses.

   o  The SMIv2 LAST-UPDATED clause is ignored if the associated date
      matches a REVISION clause.  Otherwise, an additional revision
      statement is generated.

   o  A top-level YANG container is generated.  The container's name is
      the SMIv2 module name, and the container MUST be config false.
      The generation of the top-level container MAY be skipped if the
      SMIv2 module does not define any objects that go into the top-
      level container (e.g., an SMIv2 module only defining textual
      conventions).

   o  The object identifier value of the invocation of the SMIv2 MODULE-
      IDENTITY is translated into an smiv2:oid statement contained in an
      smiv2:alias statement representing the MODULE-IDENTITY macro
      invocation.  Refer to the YANG extension defined in Section 10.

   While all proper SMIv2 modules must have exactly one MODULE-IDENTITY
   macro invocation, there are a few notable exceptions.  The modules
   defining the SMIv2 language (i.e., the SNMPv2-SMI, SNMPv2-TC, and
   SNMPv2-CONF modules) do not invoke the MODULE-IDENTITY macro.
   Furthermore, SMIv2 modules generated from SMIv1 modules may miss an
   invocation of the MODULE-IDENTITY macro as well.  In such cases, it
   is preferable to not generate organization, contact, description, or
   revision statements.

4.2.  Example: MODULE-IDENTITY of IF-MIB

   The translation of the MODULE-IDENTITY of the IF-MIB [RFC2863] leads
   to the following YANG statements:

5.  Translation of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION Macro

   The SMIv2 uses invocations of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro to define
   new types derived from the SMIv2 base types.  Invocations of the
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro MUST be translated into YANG typedef
   statements as detailed below.

5.1.  TEXTUAL-CONVENTION Translation Rules

   The name of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro invocation is used as the
   name of the generated typedef statement.  The clauses of the SMIv2
   TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro are mapped to YANG statements embedded in
   the typedef statement as follows:

   o  The SMIv2 DISPLAY-HINT clause is used to determine the type
      mapping of types derived form the OCTET STRING type as explained
      in Section 2.  Furthermore, the DISPLAY-HINT value MAY be used to
      generate a regular expression for the YANG pattern statement
      within the type statement.

   o  The SMIv2 DISPLAY-HINT is translated into an smiv2:display-hint
      statement.  Refer to the YANG extension defined in Section 10.

   o  The SMIv2 STATUS clause is mapped to the YANG status statement.
      The generation of the YANG status statement is skipped if the
      value of the STATUS clause is current.

   o  The SMIv2 DESCRIPTION clause is mapped to the YANG description
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 REFERENCE clause is mapped to the YANG reference
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 SYNTAX clause is mapped to the YANG type statement.
      SMIv2 range restrictions are mapped to YANG range statements,
      while SMIv2 length restrictions are mapped to YANG length
      statements.  SMIv2 INTEGER enumerations are mapped to YANG enum/
      value statements.  SMIv2 BITS are mapped to YANG bit/position
      statements.  For OCTET STRING types that are mapped to a YANG
      string base type (see Section 2), the length specified in the YANG
      length statement must be consistent with the stringified
      representation of values.  If an implementation is unable to
      derive a proper length restrictions, then the YANG length
      statement MUST be omitted.

RFC 6643              Translation of SMIv2 to YANG             July 2012


   This translation assumes that labels of named numbers and named bits
   do not change when an SMIv2 module is revised.  This is consistent
   with the clarification of the SMIv2 module revision rules in Section
   4.9 of [RFC4181].

5.2.  Example: OwnerString and InterfaceIndex of IF-MIB

   The translations of the OwnerString and InterfaceIndex textual
   conventions of the IF-MIB [RFC2863] are shown below.

     typedef OwnerString {
       type string {
         length "0..255";
         pattern '\p{IsBasicLatin}{0,255}';
       }
       status deprecated;
       description
        "This data type is used to model an administratively
         assigned name of the owner of a resource.  This information
         is taken from the NVT ASCII character set.  It is suggested
         that this name contain one or more of the following: ASCII
         form of the manager station's transport address, management
         station name (e.g., domain name), network management
         personnel's name, location, or phone number.  In some cases
         the agent itself will be the owner of an entry.  In these
         cases, this string shall be set to a string starting with
         'agent'.";
       smiv2:display-hint "255a";
     }

     typedef InterfaceIndex {
       type int32 {
         range "1..2147483647";
       }
       description
        "A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface or

         constant at least from one re-initialization of the entity's
         network management system to the next re-initialization.";
       smiv2:display-hint "d";
     }

5.3.  Example: IfDirection of the DIFFSERV-MIB

   The translation of the IfDirection textual convention of the
   DIFFSERV-MIB [RFC3289] is shown below.

     typedef IfDirection {
       type enumeration {
         enum inbound  { value 1; }
         enum outbound { value 2; }
       }
       description
        "IfDirection specifies a direction of data travel on an
         interface. 'inbound' traffic is operated on during reception
         from the interface, while 'outbound' traffic is operated on
         prior to transmission on the interface.";
     }

6.  Translation of OBJECT IDENTIFIER Assignments

   The SMIv2 uses OBJECT IDENTIFIER assignments to introduce names for
   intermediate nodes in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER tree.  OBJECT IDENTIFIER
   assignments are translated into smiv2:alias statements.  Refer to the
   YANG extension defined in Section 10.

7.  Translation of the OBJECT-TYPE Macro

   The SMIv2 uses the OBJECT-TYPE macro to define objects and the
   structure of conceptual tables.  Objects exist either as scalars
   (exactly one instance within an SNMP context) or columnar objects
   within conceptual tables (zero or multiple instances within an SNMP
   context).  A number of auxiliary objects define the index (key) of a
   conceptual table.  Furthermore, conceptual tables can be augmented by
   other conceptual tables.  All these differences must be taken into
   account when translating SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro invocations to YANG.
   Invocations of the OBJECT-TYPE macro MUST be translated into YANG
   statements as detailed below.

7.1.  Scalar and Columnar Object Translation Rules

   SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro invocations defining scalars or columnar
   objects with a MAX-ACCESS of "not-accessible", "read-only",
   "read-write", and "read-create" are translated to YANG leaf
   statements.  Additionally, columnar objects with a MAX-ACCESS of
   "accessible-for-notify" are translated to YANG leaf statements if
   that columnar object is part of the INDEX clause of the table
   containing that columnar object.  The name of the leaf is the name
   associated with the SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation.  SMIv2
   OBJECT-TYPE macro invocations with a MAX-ACCESS of

   "accessible-for-notify" are not translated to YANG data tree leafs
   but instead are translated into YANG notification leafs.

   Leaf statements for scalar objects are created in a container
   representing the scalar's parent node in the OID tree.  This
   container is named after the scalar's parent node in the OID tree and
   placed in the top-level container representing the SMIv2 module; see
   Section 4.1.  In the rare case that the scalar's parent node has
   multiple names, the automatic translation MUST fail with an error,
   and the name clash needs to be investigated and fixed manually.  In
   case a previous revision of the SMIv2 module did not have an
   ambiguity, then the name used by the previous revision MUST be used.
   The leaf statements representing columnar objects are created in the
   list representing a conceptual row; see Section 7.3.

   o  The SMIv2 SYNTAX clause is mapped to the YANG type statement.
      SMIv2 range restrictions are mapped to YANG range statements,
      while SMIv2 length restrictions are mapped to YANG length
      statements.  SMIv2 INTEGER enumerations are mapped to YANG enum/
      value statements.  SMIv2 BITS are mapped to YANG bit/position
      statements.  For OCTET STRING types that are mapped to a YANG
      string base type (see Section 2), the length specified in the YANG
      length statement must be consistent with the stringified
      representation of values.  If an implementation is unable to
      derive proper length restrictions, then the YANG length statement
      MUST be omitted.

   o  The SMIv2 UNITS clause is mapped to the YANG units statement.

   o  The SMIv2 MAX-ACCESS is translated into an smiv2:max-access
      statement.  Refer to the YANG extension defined in Section 10.

   o  The SMIv2 STATUS clause is mapped to the YANG status statement.
      The generation of the YANG status statement is skipped if the
      value of the STATUS clause is current.

   o  The SMIv2 DESCRIPTION clause is mapped to the YANG description
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 REFERENCE clause is mapped to the YANG reference
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 DEFVAL clause is mapped to an smiv2:defval statement.
      Refer to the YANG extension defined in Section 10.

   o  The value of the SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation is translated
      into an smiv2:oid statement.  Refer to the YANG extension defined
      in Section 10.

RFC 6643              Translation of SMIv2 to YANG             July 2012


   This translation assumes that labels of named numbers and named bits
   do not change when an SMIv2 module is revised.  This is consistent
   with the clarification of the SMIv2 module revision rules in Section
   4.9 of [RFC4181].

7.2.  Example: ifNumber and ifIndex of the IF-MIB

   The translations of the ifNumber scalar object and the ifIndex
   columnar object of the IF-MIB [RFC2863] are shown below.  Since
   ifNumber is a scalar object in the interfaces branch of the IF-MIB,
   the YANG leaf ifNumber will be placed in a YANG container called
   interfaces, which is registered in the top-level container IF-MIB.

     leaf ifNumber {
       type int32;
       description
        "The number of network interfaces (regardless of their
         current state) present on this system.";
       smiv2:max-access "read-only";
       smiv2:oid "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.1";
     }

     leaf ifIndex {
       type if-mib:InterfaceIndex;
       description
        "A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It
         is recommended that values are assigned contiguously
         starting from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer
         must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
         the entity's network management system to the next re-
         initialization.";
       smiv2:max-access "read-only";
       smiv2:oid "1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1";
     }

7.3.  Non-Augmenting Conceptual Table Translation Rules

   An OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation defining a non-augmenting conceptual
   table is translated to a YANG container statement using the name of
   the OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation.  This container is created in the
   top-level container representing the SMIv2 module.  The clauses of
   the macro are translated as follows:

   o  The SMIv2 SYNTAX clause is ignored

   o  The SMIv2 UNITS clause is ignored.

   o  The SMIv2 MAX-ACCESS clause is ignored.

   o  The SMIv2 STATUS clause is mapped to the YANG status statement.
      The generation of the YANG status statement is skipped if the
      value of the STATUS clause is current.

   o  The SMIv2 DESCRIPTION clause is mapped to the YANG description
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 REFERENCE clause is mapped to the YANG reference
      statement.

   o  The value of the SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation is translated
      into an smiv2:oid statement.  Refer to the YANG extension defined
      in Section 10.

   An OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation defining a conceptual row is
   translated to a YANG list statement.  It is contained in the YANG
   container representing the conceptual table.  The generated list uses
   the name of the row OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation.  The clauses of the
   OBJECT-TYPE macro are translated as follows:

   o  The SMIv2 SYNTAX clause is ignored.

   o  The SMIv2 UNITS clause is ignored.

   o  The SMIv2 MAX-ACCESS clause is ignored.

   o  The SMIv2 STATUS clause is mapped to the YANG status statement.
      The generation of the YANG status statement is skipped if the
      value of the STATUS clause is current.

   o  The SMIv2 DESCRIPTION clause is mapped to the YANG description
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 REFERENCE clause is mapped to the YANG reference
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 INDEX clause is mapped to the YANG key clause listing
      the columnar objects forming the key of the YANG list.  If the
      same object appears more than once in the INDEX clause, append
      '_<n>' to the duplicate object name(s) where '<n>' counts the
      occurrences of the object in the INDEX clause, starting from 2.
      Additional leaf statements must be created to define the leafs
      introduced.

   o  If the SMIv2 INDEX clause contains the IMPLIED keyword, then an
      smiv2:implied statement is generated to record the name of the
      object preceded by the IMPLIED keyword.  Refer to the YANG
      extension defined in Section 10.

   o  The value of the SMIv2 OBJECT-TYPE macro invocation is translated
      into an smiv2:oid statement.  Refer to the YANG extension defined
      in Section 10.

   Within the list statement, YANG leaf statements are created for
   columnar objects as described in Section 7.1.  For objects listed in
   the SMIv2 INDEX clause that are not part of the conceptual table
   itself, YANG leaf statements of type leafref pointing to the
   referenced definition are created.

7.4.  Example: ifTable of the IF-MIB

   The translation of the definition of the ifTable of the IF-MIB

8.  Translation of the OBJECT-IDENTITY Macro

   The SMIv2 uses invocations of the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro to define
   information about an OBJECT IDENTIFIER assignment.  Invocations of
   the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro MUST be translated into YANG identity
   statements as detailed below.

8.1.  OBJECT-IDENTITY Translation Rules

   The name of the OBJECT-IDENTITY macro invocation is used as the name
   of the generated identity statement.  The generated identity
   statement uses the smiv2:object-identity defined in Section 10 as its
   base.  The clauses of the SMIv2 OBJECT-IDENTITY macro are mapped to
   YANG statements as follows:

   o  The SMIv2 STATUS clause is mapped to the YANG status statement.
      The generation of the YANG status statement is skipped if the
      value of the STATUS clause is current.

   o  The SMIv2 DESCRIPTION clause is mapped to the YANG description
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 REFERENCE clause is mapped to the YANG reference
      statement.

   o  The value of the SMIv2 OBJECT-IDENTITY macro invocation is
      translated into an smiv2:oid statement.  Refer to the YANG
      extension defined in Section 10.

8.2.  Example: diffServTBParamSimpleTokenBucket of the DIFFSERV-MIB

   The translation of the diffServTBParamSimpleTokenBucket of the

9.  Translation of the NOTIFICATION-TYPE Macro

   SMIv2 provides the NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro to define event
   notifications.  YANG provides the notification statement for the same
   purpose.  Invocations of the NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro MUST be
   translated into YANG notification statements as detailed below.

9.1.  NOTIFICATION-TYPE Translation Rules

   The name of the NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro invocation is used as the
   name of the generated notification statement.  The clauses of the
   NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro are mapped to YANG statements embedded in the
   notification statement as follows.

   o  The SMIv2 OBJECTS clause is mapped to a sequence of YANG
      containers.  For each object listed in the OBJECTS clause value, a
      YANG container statement is generated.  The name of this container
      is the string "object-<n>", where <n> is the position of the
      object in the value of the OBJECTS clause (first element has
      position 1).  If the current object belongs to a conceptual table,
      then a sequence of leaf statements is generated for each INDEX
      object of the conceptual table.  These leafs are named after the
      INDEX objects and of type leafref.  Finally, a leaf statement is
      generated named after the current object.  If the current object
      has a MAX-ACCESS of "read-only", "read-write", or "read-create",
      then the generated leaf is of type leafref.  Otherwise, if the
      current object has a MAX-ACCESS of "accessible-for-notify", then a
      leaf is generated, following the steps in Section 7.1.

   o  The SMIv2 STATUS clause is mapped to the YANG status statement.
      The generation of the YANG status statement is skipped if the
      value of the STATUS clause is current.

   o  The SMIv2 DESCRIPTION clause is mapped to the YANG description
      statement.

   o  The SMIv2 REFERENCE clause is mapped to the YANG reference
      statement.

   o  The value of the SMIv2 NOTIFICATION-TYPE macro invocation is
      translated into an smiv2:oid statement.  Refer to the YANG
      extension defined in Section 10.

11.  Implementing Configuration Data Nodes

   The result of the translation of SMIv2 MIB modules into YANG modules,
   even if SMIv2 objects are read-write or read-create, consists of
   read-only (config false) YANG objects.  One reason is that the
   persistency models of the underlying protocols, SNMP and NETCONF, are
   quite different.  With SNMP, the persistency of a writable object
   depends either on the object definition itself (i.e., the text in the
   DESCRIPTION clause) or the persistency properties of the conceptual
   row it is part of, sometimes controlled via a columnar object using
   the StorageType textual convention.  With NETCONF, the persistency of
   configuration objects is determined by the properties of the
   underlying datastore.  Furthermore, NETCONF as defined in [RFC6241]
   does not provide a standard operation to modify operational state.
   The <edit-config> and <copy-config> operations only manipulate
   configuration data.  As a consequence of these considerations, it is
   not possible to generate YANG configuration data nodes from SMIv2
   definitions in an automated way.

RFC 6643              Translation of SMIv2 to YANG             July 2012


   However, for selected SMIv2 objects where the SNMP and NETCONF
   persistency semantics are consistent, implementations may choose to
   implement some YANG data nodes generated from SMIv2 definitions as
   configuration data nodes.  Such a deviation from the generated read-
   only YANG module should be formally documented in the form of a
   separate YANG module that uses YANG deviation statements to change
   the config property of the data nodes implemented as configuration
   data nodes from false to true.  Deviations that change the config
   false property to true without any other changes to the semantics of
   the data node do not affect the compliance with the YANG module
   generated from an SMIv2 module.

11.1.  Example: addressMapControlTable of RMON2-MIB

   The following example demonstrates how certain columnar objects of
   the addressMapControlTable of the RMON2-MIB [RFC4502] can be turned
   into YANG configuration data nodes.  Note that YANG deviations affect
   the property of the target node only and are not inherited downwards.

       namespace "http://acme.example.com/RMON2-MIB-deviations";
       prefix "acme-rmon2-devs";

   This document defines a translation of SMIv2 MIB modules into YANG
   modules, enabling read-only (config false) access to data objects
   defined in SMIv2 MIB modules via NETCONF.  The translation itself has
   no security impact on the Internet.

   Users of YANG data models generated from SMIv2 data models that have
   been published in the RFC series are advised to consult the security
   considerations of the respective RFCs.  The security considerations
   of RFCs containing SMIv2 data models explain which objects are
   sensitive and important to protect.  NETCONF users are encouraged to
   make use of the NETCONF access control model [RFC6536], which allows
   the specification of access control rules to protect potentially
   sensitive information.

Appendix B.  Module Prefix Generation (Informative)

   This section describes an algorithm to generate module prefixes to be
   used in the import statements.  The input of the prefix generation
   algorithm is a set of prefixes (usually derived from imported module
   names) and a specific module name to be converted into a prefix.  The
   algorithm described below produces a prefix for the given module name
   that is unique within the set of prefixes.

                       +-----------------+--------+
                       | YANG Module     | Prefix |
                       +-----------------+--------+
                       | ietf-yang-types | yang   |
                       | ietf-inet-types | inet   |
                       | ietf-yang-smiv2 | smiv2  |
                       +-----------------+--------+

           Table 1: Special Prefixes For Well-Known YANG Modules

   o  First, some predefined translations mapping well-known YANG
      modules to short prefixes are tried (see Table 1).  If a fixed
      translation rule exists and leads to a conflict-free prefix, then
      the fixed translation is used.

   o  Otherwise, prefixes are generated by tokenizing a YANG module
      name, using hyphens as token separators.  The tokens derived from
      the module name are converted to lowercase characters.  The prefix
      then becomes the shortest sequence of tokens concatenated using
      hyphens as separators, which includes at least two tokens and
      which is unique among all prefixes used in the YANG module.

   In the worst case, the prefix derived from an SMIv2 module name
   becomes the SMIv2 module name translated to lowercase.  But on
   average, much shorter prefixes are generated.
