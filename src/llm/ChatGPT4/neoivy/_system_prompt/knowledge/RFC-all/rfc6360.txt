                    Conclusion of FYI RFC Sub-Series

Abstract

   This document concludes the For Your Information (FYI) sub-series of
   RFCs, established by RFC 1150 for use by the IETF User Services Area,
   which no longer exists.  The IESG does not intend to make any further
   additions to this RFC sub-series, and this document provides a record
   of this decision.  This document also obsoletes RFC 1150 and changes
   the status of RFC 1150 to Historic.

RFC 6360            Conclusion of FYI RFC Sub-Series         August 2011


1.  Background

   The For Your Information (FYI) sub-series of RFCs was established by
   RFC 1150 [RFC1150] in 1990 for use by the IETF User Services Area,
   which has not met since IETF 53 held in March 2001.  This RFC sub-
   series was designed to provide Internet users with a repository of
   information regarding the Internet that might be interesting to a
   wide range of people.

   The publication of RFC 1150 [RFC1150] introduced the FYI sub-series
   of RFCs.  Since that time, a total of 38 FYI numbers have been
   assigned.  Many other Informational RFCs have been published that are
   not part of the FYI sub-series.

   The list of documents in the FYI sub-series can be found on the RFC
   Editor web site [INDEX].

2.  Conclusion of the FYI Sub-Series

   The IESG does not intend to make any further additions to the FYI
   sub-series.  The IESG intends to continue to produce Informational
   RFCs, but none of them will be assigned an FYI number.

   All published RFCs that are currently part of the FYI sub-series will
   retain their FYI numbers.  The FYI numbers continue to provide
   reference points for these documents, and the FYI number can be used
   in citations to these documents.

   If a future RFC is published that obsoletes an existing member of the
   FYI sub-series, the new RFC will not be assigned an FYI number.

3.  RFC 1150 Moved to Historic

   This document moves RFC 1150 [RFC1150] to Historic.  The procedural
   information in RFC 1150 is no longer valid.  If it becomes desirable
   to make additions to the FYI sub-series in the future, new procedures
   can be developed to replace this document.

4.  Security Considerations

   No Internet security issues are anticipated by the actions described
   in this document.
