RFC 7142                  RFC 1142 to Historic             February 2014


1.  Introduction

   IS-IS is the "OSI Intermediate system to Intermediate system intra-
   domain routeing information exchange protocol for use in conjunction
   with the protocol for providing the connectionless-mode Network
   Service (ISO 8473)", otherwise known as ISO/IEC 10589.  It has been
   extended for use with IP by RFC 1195 [RFC1195] and subsequently
   enhanced by many other RFCs.

   RFC 1142 [RFC1142] was a republication of ISO DP 10589 originally
   provided as a service to the Internet community.  However, ISO DP
   10589 was an ISO "Draft Proposal", which differed in a considerable
   number of significant respects from the final standardized version
   published as ISO/IEC 10589 [ISO10589-First-Edition], and subsequently
   revised as ISO/IEC 10589 Second Edition [ISO10589-Second-Edition].
   It has been an ongoing source of confusion when RFC 1142 has been
   unwittingly quoted or referenced in place of ISO/IEC 10589 itself.

   All references to IS-IS should be to the latest edition of the IS-IS
   standard (currently ISO/IEC 10589:2002, Second Edition), and RFC 1142
   is only of historic interest.

   This memo explains why RFC 1142, "OSI IS-IS Intra-domain Routing
   Protocol", is reclassified to Historic status.  This memo also
   obsoletes RFC 1142.

2.  Security Considerations

   Reclassifying RFC 1142 has no security considerations.
