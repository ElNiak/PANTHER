RFC 5877          application/pkix-attr-cert Media Type         May 2010


1.  Introduction

   RFC 2585 [RFC2585] defines the MIME media types for public key
   certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs).  This document
   specifies a MIME media type for use with attribute certificates as
   defined in RFC 5755 [RFC5755].

   Attribute certificates are ASN.1 encoded [X.680].  RFC 5755 [RFC5755]
   tells which portions of the attribute certificate must use the
   distinguished encoding rules (DER) [X.690] and which portions are
   permitted to use the basic encoding rules (BER) [X.690].  Since DER
   is a proper subset of BER, BER decoding all parts of a properly
   constructed attribute certificate will be successful.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers with IANA the "application/pkix-attr-cert"
   Internet Media Type for use with an attribute certificate as defined
   in [RFC5755].  This registration follows the procedures defined in
   BCP 13 [RFC4288].

      Type name: application

      Subtype name: pkix-attr-cert

      Required parameters: None

      Optional parameters: None

      Encoding considerations: binary

      Security considerations:
        An attribute certificate provides authorization information.  An
        attribute certificate is most often used in conjunction with a
        public key certificate [RFC5280], and the two certificates
        should use the same encoding of the distinguished name as
        described in the Security Considerations of this document.

      Interoperability considerations:
        The media type will be used with HTTP to fetch attribute
        certificates.  Other uses may emerge in the future.

      Published specification: RFC 5755

RFC 5877          application/pkix-attr-cert Media Type         May 2010


      Applications that use this media type:
        The media type is used with a MIME-compliant transport to
        transfer an attribute certificate.  Attribute certificates
        convey authorization information, and they are most often used
        in conjunction with public key certificates as defined in
        [RFC5280].

      Additional information:
        Magic number(s): None
        File extension(s): .ac
        Macintosh File Type Code(s): none

3.  Security Considerations

   Attribute certificate issuers must encode the holder entity name in
   exactly the same way as the public key certificate distinguished
   name.  If they are encoded differently, implementations may fail to
   recognize that the attribute certificate and public key certificate
   belong to the same entity.
