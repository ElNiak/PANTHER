RFC 2394          IP Payload Compression Using DEFLATE     December 1998


1. Introduction

   The IP Payload Compression Protocol allows the compression of IP
   datagrams by supporting different compression algorithms.  This
   document describes how to integrate the DEFLATE compression algorithm
   [Deutsch96] into IPCOMP [IPCOMP].

   This document SHOULD be read in conjunction with [IPCOMP] and MUST be
   taken in its context.

1.1 The DEFLATE Compression Algorithm

   The 'deflate' compression format [Deutsch96], as used by the PKZIP
   and gzip compressors and as embodied in the freely and widely
   distributed zlib [Gailly95] library source code, has the following
   features:

   o an apparently unencumbered encoding and compression algorithm,
     with an open and publicly-available specification.

   o low-overhead escape mechanism for incompressible data.  The PPP
     Deflate specification offers options to reduce that overhead
     further.

   o heavily used for many years in networks, on modem and other point-
     to-point links to transfer files for personal computers and
     workstations.

   o easily achieves 2:1 compression on the Calgary corpus [Corpus90]
     using less than 64KBytes of memory on both sender and receive.

1.2 Licensing

   The zlib source is widely and freely available, subject to the
   following copyright:

         must not claim that you wrote the original software. If you use
         this software in a product, an acknowledgment in the product
         documentation would be appreciated but is not required.

      2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and

      If you use the zlib library in a product, we would appreciate
      *not* receiving lengthy legal documents to sign. The sources are
      provided for free but without warranty of any kind.  The library
      has been entirely written by Jean-Loup Gailly and Mark Adler; it
      does not include third-party code.

   The deflate format and compression algorithm are based on Lempel-Ziv
   LZ77 compression; extensive research has been done by the GNU Project
   and the Portable Network Graphics working group supporting its patent
   free status.

1.3 Specification of Requirements

   The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   and "MAY" that appear in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [Bradner97].

2. DEFLATE Algorithm Implementation

   The DEFLATE compression algorithm was designed by Phil Katz and its
   details are publicly available in [Deutsch96].  Thus it is a good
   freely available algorithm to implement within IPCOMP.

   Compression and decompression algorithm details should be followed as
   outlined in [Deutsch96] or the use of a software library may be
   preferable.  Since IPComp is a stateless protocol, history MUST be
   cleared between packets when either compressing or decompressing.

2.1 Compression

   As defined in [IPCOMP], the compression process is determined by the
   IP Compression Association (IPCA).  The IPCA MUST define the DEFLATE
   algorithm for the process within this document to take place.

   The compression process entails compressing the data from the IP
   datagram and placing the result after the IPComp header.  For
   example, compressing a TCP datagram;

   Before:  IP TCP ...
   After:   IP IPCOMP (TCP ...)

   Please note how everything after the IPCOMP header is compressed.

   DEFLATE allows for a number of compression levels ranging from best
   compression but slow to fast compression.  The level that one
   compresses data is implementation dependant since it is always
   compatible with the decompression algorithm.

2.2 Decompression

   As in the compression process, the IPCA defines the parameters and
   algorithm to utilize for the decompression process.

   As defined in [IPCOMP] the data after the IPComp header is
   decompressed and replaces the IPComp header within the IP header.

   Decompression using the DEFLATE algorithm follows the decompression
   process defined in [Deutsch96].

3. Thresholds

   As stated in [IPCOMP], compression on small buffers does not usually
   work as well as on fast links since the time it takes to compress is
   slower than the time to transport the data.  Informal tests show that
   the average buffer size that produces larger results is around 90
   bytes.  Thus implementations SHOULD NOT attempt to compress buffers
   smaller than 90 bytes.

   Other than a packet size limit, no compressibility test as defined in
   [IPCOMP] is outlined in this document.

4. IPSec Transform Identifier

   [IPDOI] states that the ISAKMP IPCOMP transform ID for the DEFLATE
   compression algorithm is IPCOMP_DEFLATE.  No other ISAKMP parameters
   are required for the IPCOMP DEFLATE algorithm.

5. Security Considerations

   This document does not add any further security considerations that
   [IPCOMP] and [Deutsch96] have already declared.
