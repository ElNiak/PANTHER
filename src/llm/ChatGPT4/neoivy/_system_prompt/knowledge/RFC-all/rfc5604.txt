1.  Introduction

   This document describes a model for managing TDM pseudowires, i.e.,
   TDM data encapsulated for transmission over a Packet Switched Network
   (PSN).  The term TDM in this document is limited to the scope of
   Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH).  It is currently specified to
   carry any TDM Signals in either Structure Agnostic Transport mode
   (E1, T1, E3, and T3) or in Structure Aware Transport mode (E1, T1,
   and NxDS0) as defined in the Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
   TDM Requirements document [RFC4197].

   This document is closely related to [SATOP], [TDMOIP], and [CESOPSN],
   which describe the encapsulation of TDM signals and provide the
   Circuit Emulation Service over a PSN.

   The TDM management model consists of several MIB modules, following
   the layering model described in the PWE3 Architecture document
   [RFC3985].  The TDM MIB module described in this document works
   closely with the MIB modules described in [DS3MIB], [DS1MIB],
   [DS0MIB], [IFMIB], [PWMIB], and with the textual conventions defined
   in [PWTC].  The conceptual layering and relationship among all those
   is described in Figure 1 below.  A TDM connection will be a
   pseudowire (PW) connection.  It will not be treated as an interface
   and will therefore not be represented in the ifTable.

2.   Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [BCP14].

3.  Terminology

   The basic terminology used to refer to transmission direction in this
   document is taken from [SATOP], which describes a mechanism for
   transporting Structure-Agnostic (TDM) bit-streams over a packet-
   oriented network.  To simplify this document, the terminology is used
   for structured and unstructured TDM as well.

   "PSN-bound" references the traffic direction where TDM data is
   received, adapted to the packet based on the number of payload bytes
   per packet, assigned a relevant TDM header (sequence numbers, flags,
   and timestamps (if the RTP header is used)), prepended multiplexing
   layer and PSN headers, and sent into the PSN.

   Conversely, the "CE-bound" references the traffic direction where
   packets are received from the PSN, packet payloads are reassembled by
   including a jitter buffer where payload of the received TDM packets





Nicklass                    Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 5604                  Manage TDM over PSN                  July 2009


   is stored prior to play out to the TDM line.  The size of this buffer
   SHOULD be locally configurable to allow accommodation to the PSN-
   specific packet delay variation.

   The CE-bound TDM interworking function (IWF) SHOULD use the sequence
   number in the control word for the detection of lost (Loss of Packet
   State (LOPS)) and mis-ordered packets.  If the RTP header is used,
   the RTP sequence numbers MAY be used for the same purposes.

4.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

5.  Overview

   This MIB module is designed to satisfy the following requirements and
   constraints:

   1.  Fit within the architecture defined by [RFC3985] and [PWMIB].

   2.  Support edge-to-edge emulation of any TDM connections.

   3.  Configure the connection.  The connection-specific behavior is
       provided via the supplement MIB modules.

   4.  Report various alarms, counters, and status objects.

6.  TDM MIB Module Usage

6.1.  Structure of TDM MIB

   The MIB consists of five tables;

   - The TDM PW Table (pwTDMTable) contains generic TDM information
     regarding the PW connection.  It contains the ifIndex of the TDM
     interface, an index to an entry in the generic configuration table



Nicklass                    Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 5604                  Manage TDM over PSN                  July 2009


     (pwTDMCfgTable), an index to an entry in the specific configuration
     table (pwCXXXCfgTable, where XXX can be TDMoIP (TDM over IP) or
     CESoPSN (Circuit Emulation Service over PSN)), config error
     indications, and various status indications.  The two indices of
     the two configuration tables are providing the connection
     parameters.  The TDM interface can be a full link of any TDM type
     like E1 or DS3, for example, or the interface of the bundle holding
     the collection of time slots to be transmitted.  Based on the TDM
     PW type, the relevant pwXXXCfgTable from the relevant MIB module
     will be used.  The specific types are:

      o  17 Structure-agnostic E1 over Packet

      o  18 Structure-agnostic T1 (DS1) over Packet

      o  19 Structure-agnostic E3 over Packet

      o  20 Structure-agnostic T3 (DS3) over Packet

      o  21 CESoPSN basic mode (XXX=CESoPSN)

      o  22 TDMoIP AAL1mode (XXX=TDMoIP)

      o  23 CESoPSN TDM with CAS (XXX=CESoPSN)

      o  24 TDMoIP AAL2 Mode (XXX=TDMoIP)

   - The TDM Generic Parameter Table (pwTDMCfgTable) contains TDM
     generic configurable parameters for any TDM type.

   - The TDM Performance Current Table (pwTDMPerfCurrentTable) contains
     TDM statistics for the current 15-minute period.

   - The TDM Performance Interval Table (pwTDMPerfIntervalTable)
     contains TDM statistics for historical intervals (usually 96 15-
     minute entries to cover a 24 hour period).

   - The TDM Performance One-Day Interval Table
     (pwTDMPerf1DayIntervalTable) contains TDM statistics for historical
     intervals accumulated per day.  Usually 30 one-day entries to cover
     a monthly period.

6.2.  TDM Connection Configuration Procedure

   Configuring a TDM PW involves the following steps:

   First, configure the parameters of the interface-specific layer using
   the DS1-MIB and or the DS3-MIB.



Nicklass                    Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 5604                  Manage TDM over PSN                  July 2009


   Next, if applicable, create a bundle of time slots using the DS0
   Bundle MIB [DS0MIB].

   Next, create an entry in the pwTable and configure the PSN tunnels:

   - Follow steps as defined in [PWMIB].

   NOTE: The agent should create an entry in the pwTDMTable for any
   entry created in the pwTable with pwType equal to a value between
   (17) and (24).

   Next complete the TDM PW configuration:

   - If necessary, create an entry in the relevant pwXXXCfgTable and in
     the pwTDMTable (suitable entries may already exist in both tables).

   - Set the index of the relevant pwXXXCfgTable entry and of the
     relevant pwTDMCfgTable entry in the pwTDMTable.

6.3.  TDM PW Monitoring

   Upon making the TDM PW operational, the pwTDMPerfCurrentTable,
   pwTDMPerfIntervalTable, and PwTDMPerf1DayIntervalTable can be used to
   monitor the various counters, indicators, and conditions of the PW.
   All performance parameters are accumulated in daily intervals and in
   15-minute intervals.  The number of daily intervals kept by the agent
   is based on the specific implementation.  The 15-minute intervals, up
   to 96 intervals (24 hours worth), are all kept by the agent.  Fewer
   than 96 intervals of data will be available if the agent has been
   restarted within the last 24 hours.  Performance parameters continue
   to be collected when the interface is down.  There is no requirement
   for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship between the start of a
   15-minute interval and any wall clock; however, some agents may align
   the 15-minute intervals with quarter hours.  Performance parameters
   are of types PerfCurrentCount and PerfIntervalCount.  These textual
   conventions are all Gauge32, and they are used because it is possible
   for these objects to decrease.

7.  Example of Actual TDM PW Setup

   This section provides an example of using the various MIB objects
   described in the following section to set up a TDM PW connection.

   The first example is setting a connection of DS1 type.  The second
   example is setting a connection with a bandwidth of 3 DS0 (time
   slots).





Nicklass                    Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 5604                  Manage TDM over PSN                  July 2009


   While those examples are not meant to illustrate all options of the
   MIB, they are intended as an aid to understanding some of the key
   concepts.  See [PWMIB] for an example of setting up PSN tunnels.

   First example:

   1.  Configure the DS1 interface using DS1-MIB.

   2.  If needed, create an entry in the pwTDMCfgTable (assuming index =
       10); verify that there are no errors in the configuration using
       the relevant object.

   3.  Get a new pwIndexNext [PWMIB] and create a new pwTable entry
       using the value of pwIndexNext (assume here, the PW index = 20).

   4.  Set the pwType [PWMIB] of the new entry to the relevant value
       (17) or (18).  This should create a new entry in the pwTDMTable.

   5.  Configure the newly created TDM PW with the required pointers,
       indices, and the relevant entry in pwTDMCfgTable (index 10).

   In [DS1MIB] dsx1IfIndex (ifIndex = 5)

      In pwTDMCfgTable entry: Set the connection characteristic
      parameters:

      {

      pwTDMCfgPayloadSize     = 43 -- payload bytes
      pwTDMCfgPktReorder      = FALSE
      pwTDMCfgRtpHdrUsed      = FALSE
      pwTDMCfgJtrBfrDepth     = 30000 -- micro-seconds

      }

      In pwTDMTable entry: Set the relevant ifIndex, the generic TDM
      index, and the specific TDM index to complete creation:

      {
        pwTDMIfIndex          = 5    -- IfIndex of associated entry
                                       -- in DS1 table
        pwGenTDMCfgIndex      = 10   -- Index of associated entry
                                       -- in pwTDMCfgTable.
        pwRelTDMCfgIndex      = 0    -- No Index in associated entry
                                       -- in pwXXXCfgTable.
      }

   Verify that there are no error bits set in pwTDMConfigError.

RFC 5604                  Manage TDM over PSN                  July 2009


   Second example:

   1.  Configure the DS1 interface using DS1-MIB.

   2.  Set up a bundle and get its dsx0BundleIfIndex.  Setting up the
       bundle should involve using IFMIB properly.

   3.  Since structured TDMoIP circuit is defined, the next MIB module
       to be used is TDMoIP-MIB.

   4.  If needed, create an entry in the pwTDMCfgTable (assuming index =
       7).

   5.  If needed, create an entry in the pwXXXCfgTable (index = 11).
       XXX can be TDMoIP or CESoPSN.

   6.  Verify that there are no errors in the configuration using the
       relevant object when signaling is in use.

   7.  Get a new pwIndexNext [PWMIB] and create a new pwTable entry
       using the value of pwIndexNext.

   8.  Set the pwType [PWMIB] of the new entry to (24).  This should
       create a new entry in the pwTDMTable.

   9.  Configure the newly created TDM PW with the required pointers,
       indices, and the relevant entries in pwTDMCfgTable and in
       pwXXXCfgTable (assuming indices 7 and 11).

      In [DS1MIB] dsx1IfIndex (ifIndex)   = 5
      In [DS0MIB] dsx0BundleIfIndex       = 8

      In pwTDMTable entry: Set the relevant ifIndex, the generic
      TDM index, and the specific TDM index to complete creation:

      {
        pwTDMIfIndex          =  8   -- IfIndex of associated entry
                                     -- in DS0 table
        pwGenTDMCfgIndex     =  7   -- Index of associated entry
                                     -- in pwTDMCfgTable.
        pwRelTDMCfgIndex     = 11   -- Index of associated entry
                                     -- in pwXXXCfgTable.
        -- pwXXXCfgTable might be an implementation specific table too.
      }

   Verify that there are no error bits set in pwTDMConfigError.

     DESCRIPTION
         "This MIB contains managed object definitions for
          encapsulating TDM (T1,E1, T3, E3, NxDS0) as
          pseudo-wires over packet-switching networks (PSN).

          This MIB supplements the PW-STD-MIB as in: Zelig, D.,
          Nadeau, T. 'Pseudowire (PW) Management Information Base'.
          The PW-STD-MIB contains structures and MIB associations
          generic to pseudowire (PW) emulation.  PW-specific
          MIBs (such as this) contain config and stats for specific
          PW types.

9.  Security Considerations

   It is clear that this MIB module is potentially useful for monitoring
   of TDM PWs.  This MIB can also be used for configuration of certain
   objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The pwTDMTable and pwTDMCfgTable contain objects of TDM PW parameters
   on a Provider Edge (PE) device.  Unauthorized access to objects in
   these tables could result in disruption of traffic on the network.

   The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
   considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be
   used with any SNMPV3 agent, which implements this MIB module.

   Administrators should consider whether read access to these objects
   should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable under certain
   circumstances.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   The pwTDMTable, pwTDMPerfCurrentTable, pwTDMPerfIntervalTable, and
   pwTDMPerf1DayIntervalTable collectively show the TDM pseudowire
   connectivity topology and its performance characteristics.

   If an Administrator does not want to reveal this information, then
   these tables should be considered sensitive/vulnerable.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:
