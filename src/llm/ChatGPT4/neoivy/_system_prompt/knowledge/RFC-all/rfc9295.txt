     Clarifications for Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, and X448 Algorithm
                              Identifiers

Abstract

   This document updates RFC 8410 to clarify existing semantics, and
   specify missing semantics, for key usage bits when used in
   certificates that support the Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, and X448
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8410] specifies the syntax and semantics for the Subject Public
   Key Information field in certificates that support Ed25519, Ed448,
   X25519, and X448 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms.  As
   part of these semantics, it defines what combinations are permissible
   for the values of the keyUsage extension [RFC5280].  [RFC8410] did
   not define what values are not permissible, nor did it refer to
   keyEncipherment or dataEncipherment.  [Err5696] has also been
   submitted to clarify that keyCertSign is always set in certification
   authority certificates.  To address these changes, this document
   replaces Section 5 of [RFC8410] with Section 3.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  New Section 5 for RFC 8410

   The intended application for the key is indicated in the keyUsage
   certificate extension.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate that indicates
   id-X25519 or id-X448 in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the following MUST
   be present:

     keyAgreement

   One of the following MAY also be present:

     encipherOnly
     decipherOnly

   and any of the following MUST NOT be present:

     digitalSignature
     nonRepudiation
     keyEncipherment
     dataEncipherment
     keyCertSign
     cRLSign

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an end-entity certificate
   that indicates id-Ed25519 or id-Ed448 in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then
   the keyUsage extension MUST contain at least one of the following:

     nonRepudiation
     digitalSignature
     cRLSign

   and any of the following MUST NOT be present:

     keyEncipherment
     dataEncipherment
     keyAgreement
     keyCertSign
     encipherOnly
     decipherOnly

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a CRL issuer certificate that
   indicates id-Ed25519 or id-Ed448 in SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the
   keyUsage extension MUST contain:

     cRLSign

   and zero or more of the following:

     nonRepudiation
     digitalSignature

   and any of the following MUST NOT be present:

     keyEncipherment
     dataEncipherment
     keyAgreement
     encipherOnly
     decipherOnly

   and if the CRL issuer is also a certification authority, then the
   keyUsage extension MUST also contain:

     keyCertSign

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a certification authority
   certificate that indicates id-Ed25519 or id-Ed448 in
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo, then the keyUsage extension MUST contain:

     keyCertSign

   and zero or more of the following:

     nonRepudiation
     digitalSignature
     cRLSign

   and any of the following MUST NOT be present:

     keyEncipherment
     dataEncipherment
     keyAgreement
     encipherOnly
     decipherOnly

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   found in [RFC8410].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
