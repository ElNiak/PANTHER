RFC 8343                YANG Interface Management             March 2018


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model [RFC7950] for the management
   of network interfaces.  It is expected that interface-type-specific
   data models will augment the generic interfaces data model defined in
   this document.

   Network interfaces are central to the management of many Internet
   protocols.  Thus, it is important to establish a common data model
   for how interfaces are identified, configured, and monitored.

   The data model includes configuration data and state data (status
   information and counters for the collection of statistics).

   This version of the interfaces data model supports the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

1.1.  Summary of Changes from RFC 7223

   The "/interfaces-state" subtree with "config false" data nodes is
   deprecated.  All "config false" data nodes are now present in the
   "/interfaces" subtree.

   Servers that do not implement NMDA, or that wish to support clients
   that do not implement NMDA, MAY implement the deprecated
   "/interfaces-state" tree.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are used within this document:

   o  system-controlled interface: An interface is said to be system-
      controlled if the system creates and deletes the interface
      independently of what has been explicitly configured.  Examples
      are interfaces representing physical hardware that appear and
      disappear when hardware (e.g., a line card or hot-pluggable
      wireless interface) is added or removed.  System-controlled
      interfaces may also appear if a certain functionality is enabled
      (e.g., a loopback interface might appear if the IP protocol stack
      is enabled).

RFC 8343                YANG Interface Management             March 2018


   o  user-controlled interface: An interface is said to be user-
      controlled if the creation of the interface is controlled by
      adding explicit interface configuration to the intended
      configuration and the removal of the interface is controlled by
      removing explicit interface configuration from the intended
      configuration.  Examples are VLAN interfaces configured on a
      system-controlled Ethernet interface.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8342] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  server

   o  configuration

   o  system state

   o  operational state

   o  intended configuration

   o  running configuration datastore

   o  operational state datastore

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  augment

   o  data model

   o  data node

1.3.  Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  Objectives

   This section describes some of the design objectives for the model
   presented in Section 5.

   o  It is recognized that existing implementations will have to map
      the interface data model defined in this memo to their proprietary
      native data model.  To facilitate such mappings, the data model
      should be simple.

   o  The data model should be suitable for new implementations to use
      as is, without requiring a mapping to a different native model.

   o  References to interfaces should be as simple as possible,
      preferably by using a single leafref.

   o  The mapping to ifIndex [RFC2863] used by the Simple Network
      Management Protocol (SNMP) to identify interfaces must be clear.

   o  The model must support interface layering: both (1) simple
      layering, where one interface is layered on top of exactly one
      other interface, and (2) more complex scenarios, where one
      interface results from the aggregation of N other interfaces or
      when N interfaces are multiplexed over one other interface.

   o  The data model should support the pre-provisioning of interface
      configuration; that is, it should be possible to configure an
      interface whose physical interface hardware is not present on the
      device.  It is recommended that devices that support dynamic
      addition and removal of physical interfaces also support
      pre-provisioning.

   o  The data model should support physical interfaces as well as
      logical interfaces.

   o  The data model should include read-only counters in order to
      gather statistics for sent and received octets and packets,
      received packets with errors, and packets that could not be sent
      due to errors.

3.  Interfaces Data Model

   the following structure, excluding the deprecated "/interfaces-state"
   subtree:

3.1.  The Interface List

   The data model for interfaces presented in this document uses a flat
   list of interfaces ("/interfaces/interface").  Each interface in the
   list is identified by its name.  Furthermore, each interface has a
   mandatory "type" leaf.

   The "iana-if-type" module [RFC7224] defines YANG identities for the
   interface types in the IANA-maintained "ifType definitions" registry.

   It is expected that interface-type-specific data models augment the
   interface list and possibly use the "type" leaf to make the
   augmentation conditional.

RFC 8343                YANG Interface Management             March 2018


   As an example of such an interface-type-specific augmentation,
   consider this YANG snippet.  For a more complete example, see
   Appendix A.

     import interfaces {
         prefix "if";
     }
     import iana-if-type {
       prefix ianaift;
     }

     augment "/if:interfaces/if:interface" {
         when "if:type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'";

         container ethernet {
             leaf duplex {
                 ...
             }
         }
     }

   For system-controlled interfaces, the "name" is the device-specific
   name of the interface.

   If the device supports arbitrarily named user-controlled interfaces,
   then the server will advertise the "arbitrary-names" feature.  If the
   server does not advertise this feature, the names of user-controlled
   interfaces MUST match the device's naming scheme.  How a client can
   learn the naming scheme of such devices is outside the scope of this
   document.  See Appendices F.1 and F.2 for examples.

   When a system-controlled interface is created in the operational
   state by the system, the system tries to apply the interface
   configuration in the intended configuration with the same name as the
   new interface.  If no such interface configuration is found, or if
   the configured type does not match the real interface type, the
   system creates the interface without applying explicit configuration.

   When a user-controlled interface is created, the configuration
   determines the name of the interface.

   Depending on the operating system and the physical attachment point
   to which a network interface may be attached or removed, it may be
   impossible for an implementation to provide predictable and
   consistent names for system-controlled interfaces across insertion/
   removal cycles as well as in anticipation of initial insertion.  The
   ability to provide configurations for such interfaces is therefore
   dependent on the implementation and cannot be assumed in all cases.

RFC 8343                YANG Interface Management             March 2018


3.2.  Interface References

   An interface is identified by its name, which is unique within the
   server.  This property is captured in the "interface-ref" typedef,
   which other YANG modules SHOULD use when they need to reference an
   interface.

3.3.  Interface Layering

   There is no generic mechanism for how an interface is configured to
   be layered on top of some other interface.  It is expected that
   interface-type-specific models define their own data nodes for
   interface layering by using "interface-ref" types to reference lower
   layers.

   Below is an example of a model with such nodes.  For a more complete
   example, see Appendix B.

     import interfaces {
         prefix "if";
     }
     import iana-if-type {
       prefix ianaift;
     }

     augment "/if:interfaces/if:interface" {
         when "if:type = 'ianaift:ieee8023adLag'";

         leaf-list slave-if {
             type if:interface-ref;
             must "/if:interfaces/if:interface[if:name = current()]"
                + "/if:type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'" {
                 description
                     "The type of a slave interface must be
                      'ethernetCsmacd'.";
             }
         }
         // other bonding config params, failover times, etc.
     }

   While the interface layering is configured in interface-type-specific
   models, two generic state data leaf-lists, "higher-layer-if" and
   "lower-layer-if", represent a read-only view of the interface
   layering hierarchy.

4.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   If the device implements the IF-MIB [RFC2863], each entry in the
   "/interfaces/interface" list in the operational state is typically
   mapped to one ifEntry.  The "if-index" leaf MUST contain the value of
   the corresponding ifEntry's ifIndex.

   In most cases, the "name" of an "/interfaces/interface" entry is
   mapped to ifName.  The IF-MIB allows two different ifEntries to have
   the same ifName.  Devices that support this feature and also support
   the data model defined in this document cannot have a 1-1 mapping
   between the "name" leaf and ifName.

   The configured "description" of an "interface" has traditionally been
   mapped to ifAlias in some implementations.  This document allows this
   mapping, but implementers should be aware of the differences in the
   value space and persistence for these objects.  See the YANG module
   definition of the leaf "description" in Section 5 for details.

   The IF-MIB also defines the writable object ifPromiscuousMode.  Since
   this object typically is not implemented as a configuration object by
   SNMP agents, it is not mapped to the "ietf-interfaces" module.

   The ifMtu object from the IF-MIB is not mapped to the
   "ietf-interfaces" module.  It is expected that interface-type-
   specific YANG modules provide interface-type-specific MTU leafs by
   augmenting the "ietf-interfaces" model.

   There are a number of counters in the IF-MIB that exist in two
   versions: one with 32 bits and one with 64 bits.  The 64-bit versions
   were added to support high-speed interfaces with a data rate greater
   than 20,000,000 bits/second.  Today's implementations generally
   support such high-speed interfaces; hence, only 64-bit counters are
   provided in this data model.  Note that the server that implements
   this module and an SNMP agent may differ in the time granularity in
   which they provide access to the counters.  For example, it is common
   that SNMP implementations cache counter values for some time.

   The objects ifDescr and ifConnectorPresent from the IF-MIB are not
   mapped to the "ietf-interfaces" module.

   The following table lists the YANG data nodes with corresponding
   objects in the IF-MIB.

RFC 8343                YANG Interface Management             March 2018


   This document registers a YANG module in the "YANG Module Names"
   registry [RFC6020].

     name:         ietf-interfaces
     namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces
     prefix:       if
     reference:    RFC 8343

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /interfaces/interface:  This list specifies the configured interfaces
      on a device.  Unauthorized access to this list could cause the
      device to ignore packets it should receive and process.

   /interfaces/interface/enabled:  This leaf controls whether or not an
      interface is enabled.  Unauthorized access to this leaf could
      cause the device to ignore packets it should receive and process.

Appendix A.  Example: Ethernet Interface Module

   This section gives a simple example of how an Ethernet interface
   module could be defined.  It demonstrates how media-specific
   configuration parameters can be conditionally augmented to the
   generic interface list.  It also shows how operational state
   parameters can be conditionally augmented to the operational
   interface list.  The example is not intended as a complete module for
   Ethernet configuration.

   module example-ethernet {
     namespace "http://example.com/ethernet";
     prefix "eth";

     import ietf-interfaces {
       prefix if;
     }
     import iana-if-type {
       prefix ianaift;
     }

     // configuration and state parameters for Ethernet interfaces
     augment "/if:interfaces/if:interface" {
       when "if:type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'";

       container ethernet {
         container transmission {
           choice transmission-params {
             case auto {
               leaf auto-negotiate {
                 type empty;
               }
             }
             case manual {
               container manual {
                 leaf duplex {
                   type enumeration {
                     enum "half";
                     enum "full";
                   }

                     enum "10Mb";
                     enum "100Mb";
                     enum "1Gb";
                     enum "10Gb";
                   }

         }
         // other Ethernet-specific params...

Appendix B.  Example: Ethernet Bonding Interface Module

   This section gives an example of how interface layering can be
   defined.  An Ethernet bonding interface that bonds several Ethernet
   interfaces into one logical interface is defined.

   module example-ethernet-bonding {
     namespace "http://example.com/ethernet-bonding";
     prefix "bond";

     import ietf-interfaces {
       prefix if;

       leaf-list slave-if {
         type if:interface-ref;
         must "/if:interfaces/if:interface[if:name = current()]"
            + "/if:type = 'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'" {
           description
             "The type of a slave interface must be 'ethernetCsmacd'.";
         }
       }
       leaf bonding-mode {
         type enumeration {
           enum round-robin;

Appendix C.  Example: VLAN Interface Module

   This section gives an example of how a VLAN interface module can be
   defined.

   module example-vlan {

     import ietf-interfaces {
       prefix if;
     }

       leaf vlan-tagging {
         type boolean;
         default false;
       }
     }

     augment "/if:interfaces/if:interface" {
       when "if:type = 'ianaift:l2vlan'";

       leaf base-interface {
         type if:interface-ref;
         must "/if:interfaces/if:interface[if:name = current()]"
            + "/vlan:vlan-tagging = 'true'" {
           description
             "The base interface must have VLAN tagging enabled.";
         }
       }
       leaf vlan-id {
         type uint16 {
           range "1..4094";

Appendix F.  Examples: Interface Naming Schemes

   This section gives examples of some implementation strategies.

   The examples make use of the example data model "example-vlan" (see
   Appendix C) to show how user-controlled interfaces can be configured.

F.1.  Router with Restricted Interface Names

   In this example, a router has support for 4 line cards, each with 8
   ports.  The slots for the cards are physically numbered from 0 to 3,
   and the ports on each card from 0 to 7.  Each card has Fast Ethernet
   or Gigabit Ethernet ports.

   The device-specific names for these physical interfaces are
   "fastethernet-N/M" or "gigabitethernet-N/M".

   The name of a VLAN interface is restricted to the form
   "<physical-interface-name>.<subinterface-number>".

   It is assumed that the operator is aware of this naming scheme.  The
   implementation auto-initializes the value for "type" based on the
   interface name.

   The NETCONF server does not advertise the "arbitrary-names" feature
   in the <hello> message.








Bjorklund                    Standards Track                   [Page 44]

RFC 8343                YANG Interface Management             March 2018


   An operator can configure a physical interface by sending an
   <edit-config> containing:

     <interface nc:operation="create">
       <name>fastethernet-1/0</name>
     </interface>

   When the server processes this request, it will set the leaf "type"
   to "ianaift:ethernetCsmacd".  Thus, if the client performs a
   <get-config> right after the <edit-config> above, it will get:

     <interface>
       <name>fastethernet-1/0</name>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
     </interface>

   The client can configure a VLAN interface by sending an <edit-config>
   containing:

     <interface nc:operation="create">
       <name>fastethernet-1/0.10005</name>
       <type>ianaift:l2vlan</type>
       <vlan:base-interface>fastethernet-1/0</vlan:base-interface>
       <vlan:vlan-id>5</vlan:vlan-id>
     </interface>

   If the client tries to change the type of the physical interface with
   an <edit-config> containing:

     <interface nc:operation="merge">
       <name>fastethernet-1/0</name>
       <type>ianaift:tunnel</type>
     </interface>

   then the server will reply with an "invalid-value" error, since the
   new type does not match the name.

F.2.  Router with Arbitrary Interface Names

   In this example, a router has support for 4 line cards, each with 8
   ports.  The slots for the cards are physically numbered from 0 to 3,
   and the ports on each card from 0 to 7.  Each card has Fast Ethernet
   or Gigabit Ethernet ports.

   The device-specific names for these physical interfaces are
   "fastethernet-N/M" or "gigabitethernet-N/M".

RFC 8343                YANG Interface Management             March 2018


   The implementation does not restrict the user-controlled interface
   names.  This allows an operator to more easily apply the interface
   configuration to a different interface.  However, the additional
   level of indirection also makes it a bit more complex to map
   interface names found in other protocols to configuration entries.

   The NETCONF server advertises the "arbitrary-names" feature in the
   <hello> message.

   Physical interfaces are configured as in Appendix F.1.

   An operator can configure a VLAN interface by sending an
   <edit-config> containing:

     <interface nc:operation="create">
       <name>acme-interface</name>
       <type>ianaift:l2vlan</type>
       <vlan:base-interface>fastethernet-1/0</vlan:base-interface>
       <vlan:vlan-id>5</vlan:vlan-id>
     </interface>

   If necessary, the operator can move the configuration named
   "acme-interface" over to a different physical interface with an
   <edit-config> containing:

     <interface nc:operation="merge">
       <name>acme-interface</name>
       <vlan:base-interface>fastethernet-1/1</vlan:base-interface>
     </interface>

F.3.  Ethernet Switch with Restricted Interface Names

   In this example, an Ethernet switch has a number of ports, each
   identified by a simple port number.

   The device-specific names for the physical interfaces are numbers
   that match the physical port number.

   An operator can configure a physical interface by sending an
   <edit-config> containing:

     <interface nc:operation="create">
       <name>6</name>
     </interface>

   When the server processes this request, it will set the leaf "type"
   to "ianaift:ethernetCsmacd".  Thus, if the client performs a
   <get-config> right after the <edit-config> above, it will get:

     <interface>
       <name>6</name>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
     </interface>

F.4.  Generic Host with Restricted Interface Names

   In this example, a generic host has interfaces named by the kernel.
   The system identifies the physical interface by the name assigned by
   the operating system to the interface.

   The name of a VLAN interface is restricted to the form
   "<physical-interface-name>:<vlan-number>".

   The NETCONF server does not advertise the "arbitrary-names" feature
   in the <hello> message.

   An operator can configure an interface by sending an <edit-config>
   containing:

     <interface nc:operation="create">
       <name>eth8</name>
     </interface>

   When the server processes this request, it will set the leaf "type"
   to "ianaift:ethernetCsmacd".  Thus, if the client performs a
   <get-config> right after the <edit-config> above, it will get:

     <interface>
       <name>eth8</name>
       <type>ianaift:ethernetCsmacd</type>
     </interface>

   The client can configure a VLAN interface by sending an <edit-config>
   containing:

     <interface nc:operation="create">
       <name>eth8:5</name>
       <type>ianaift:l2vlan</type>
       <vlan:base-interface>eth8</vlan:base-interface>
       <vlan:vlan-id>5</vlan:vlan-id>
     </interface>

F.5.  Generic Host with Arbitrary Interface Names

   In this example, a generic host has interfaces named by the kernel.
   The system identifies the physical interface by the name assigned by
   the operating system to the interface.

   The implementation does not restrict the user-controlled interface
   names.  This allows an operator to more easily apply the interface
   configuration to a different interface.  However, the additional
   level of indirection also makes it a bit more complex to map
   interface names found in other protocols to configuration entries.

   The NETCONF server advertises the "arbitrary-names" feature in the
   <hello> message.

   Physical interfaces are configured as in Appendix F.4.

   An operator can configure a VLAN interface by sending an
   <edit-config> containing:

     <interface nc:operation="create">
       <name>acme-interface</name>
       <type>ianaift:l2vlan</type>
       <vlan:base-interface>eth8</vlan:base-interface>
       <vlan:vlan-id>5</vlan:vlan-id>
     </interface>

   If necessary, the operator can move the configuration named
   "acme-interface" over to a different physical interface with an
   <edit-config> containing:

     <interface nc:operation="merge">
       <name>acme-interface</name>
       <vlan:base-interface>eth3</vlan:base-interface>
     </interface>
