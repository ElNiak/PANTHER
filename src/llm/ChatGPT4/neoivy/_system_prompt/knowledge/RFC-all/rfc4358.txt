Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform
   Resource Namespace (URN) resources published by the Open Mobile
   Alliance (OMA).  OMA defines and manages resources that utilize this
   URN name model.  Management activities for these and other resource
   types are provided by the Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA).

RFC 4358               URN Namespace for OMA                January 2006


1. Introduction

   OMA is a specification development body developing technologies for
   mobile devices.  This activity is supported by a membership composed
   of network operators, equipment vendors, content providers, and other
   suppliers to the mobile market.

   Some of the technologies being developed by OMA need XML namespaces
   that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific NID
   for use by OMA was deemed appropriate.  Therefore, a full and
   complete registration will follow the namespace specification process
   as defined in [RFC3406].

2. URN Specification for "oma" NID

   Namespace ID:

      The NID "oma" is requested.

   Registration Information:

      registration version number: 1
      registration date:           2005-07-18

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

      Registering organization
         Name:    Open Mobile Alliance
         Address: 4275 Executive Square
                  Suite 240s
                  La Jolla, CA 92037

      Designated contact
         Role:    Technical Program Manager
         Email:   TPM@omaorg.org

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the "oma"
      NID will have the following structure:

         urn:oma:{OMAresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}

      where the "OMAresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the
      URN syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of
      resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme

      that is covered by "ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms
      to the naming requirements of [RFC2141].

      OMA maintains a naming authority, the Open Mobile Naming Authority
      (OMNA), that will manage the assignment of "OMAresources" and the
      specific registration values assigned for each resource class.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) provides information on
      the registered resources and the registrations for each.  More
      information about OMNA and the registration activities and
      procedures to be followed are available at:

         http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/omna

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The OMNA will manage resources using the "oma" NID and will be the
      authority for managing the resources and subsequent strings
      associated.  In the associated procedures, OMNA will ensure the
      uniqueness of the strings themselves or shall permit secondary
      responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.

      OMA may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
      registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
      same value for separate uses.  As experimental usage is only
      intended for testing purposes, this should not be a real issue.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      OMNA will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of
      the "oma" NID.  This will be structured such that each OMAresource
      will have a separate description and registration table.

      The registration tables and information will be published and
      maintained by OMNA on its web site.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      OMNA will provide procedures for registration of each type of
      resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three
      types of registration activities:

         1) Registered values associated with OMA specs or services
         2) Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities
         3) Name models for use in experimental purposes

RFC 4358               URN Namespace for OMA                January 2006


   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of OMNA activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3. Examples

   The following examples are representative urns that could be assigned
   by OMNA.  They may not be the actual strings that would be assigned.

   urn:oma:ac:oma-presence
     Defines the urn to be used for the Application Characteristic
     object definition for providing attributes to the Presence enabler
     defined in OMA.

   urn:oma:drms:org-foobar
     Defines the urn associated with the Digital Rights Management
     System object definition allocated to foobar, which is an external
     organization that made request via OMNA for a drms urn.

4. Namespace Considerations

   The Open Mobile Alliance is developing a variety of application and
   service enablers.  Some of these enablers require that supporting
   information (e.g., data descriptions, attributes, etc.) be fully
   specified.  For proper operation, descriptions of the needed
   supporting information must exist and be available in a unique,
   reliable, and persistent manner.  These dependencies provide the
   basis of need for namespaces, in one form or another.

   As the Open Mobile Alliance work is ongoing and covers many technical
   areas, the possibility of binding to various other namespace
   repositories has been deemed impractical.  Each object or
   description, as defined in OMA, could possibly be related to multiple
   different other namespaces, so further conflicts of association could
   occur.  Thus the intent is to utilize the Open Mobile Naming
   Authority, operated by OMA, as the naming authority for OMA-defined
   objects and descriptions.

5.  Community Considerations

   The objects and descriptions required for enablers produced by OMA
   are generally available for use by other organizations.  The Open
   Mobile Naming Authority will provide access and support for name
   requests by these organizations.  This support can be enabled in a
   timely and responsive fashion as new objects and descriptions are
   produced.  These will be enabled in a fashion similar to current OMNA
   support.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The requested NID has been entered into the IANA registry for URN
   NIDs.  The update can be found at:
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces and any associated
   mirrors.
