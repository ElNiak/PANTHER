Abstract

   This document introduces a Management Information Base (MIB) module
   that defines textual conventions to represent commonly used
   transport-layer addressing information.  The definitions are
   compatible with the concept of TAddress/TDomain pairs introduced by
   the Structure of Management Information version 2 (SMIv2) and support
   the Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.

RFC 3419      Textual Conventions for Transport Addresses  December 2002


1. Introduction

   Several MIB modules need to represent transport-layer addresses in a
   generic way.  Typical examples are MIBs for application protocols
   that can operate over several different transports or application
   management MIBs that need to model generic communication endpoints.

   The SMIv2 in STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] defines the textual
   conventions TDomain and TAddress to represent generic transport layer
   endpoints.  A generic TAddress value is interpreted in a given
   transport domain which is identified by a TDomain value.  The TDomain
   is an object identifier which allows MIB authors to extend the set of
   supported transport domains by providing suitable definitions in
   standardized or enterprise specific MIB modules.

   An initial set of TDomain values and concrete TAddress formats has
   been standardized in STD 62, RFC 3417 [RFC3417].  These definitions
   are however mixed up with SNMP semantics.  Furthermore, definitions
   for Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6 are missing.

   The purpose of this memo is to introduce a set of well-known textual
   conventions to represent commonly used transport-layer addressing
   information which is compatible with the original TDomain and
   TAddress approach and which includes definitions for additional
   Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.  This memo also
   introduces a new textual convention which enumerates the well-known
   transport domains since such an enumeration provides in many cases
   sufficient flexibility and is more efficient compared to object
   identifiers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

RFC 3419      Textual Conventions for Transport Addresses  December 2002


3. Overview

   This MIB module contains definitions for commonly used transport
   layer addressing information.  In particular, it provides the
   following definitions:

   1. Textual conventions for generic transport addresses
      (TransportAddress) and generic transport domains
      (TransportDomain).

   2. Object identifier registrations for well-known transport domains.

   3. An enumeration of the well-known transport domains, called a
      transport address type (TransportAddressType).

   4. A set of textual conventions for the address formats used by
      well-known transport domains.  The DISPLAY-HINTs are aligned with
      the formats used in URIs [RFC2396], [RFC3291].

   The textual conventions for well-known transport domains support
   scoped Internet addresses.  The scope of an Internet address is a
   topological span within which the address may be used as a unique
   identifier for an interface or set of interfaces.  A scope zone, or
   simply a zone, is a concrete connected region of topology of a given
   scope.  Note that a zone is a particular instance of a topological
   region, whereas a scope is the size of a topological region [SCOPED].
   Since Internet addresses on devices that connect multiple zones are
   not necessarily unique, an additional zone index is needed on these
   devices to select an interface.  The textual conventions
   TransportAddressIPv4z and TransportAddressIPv6z are provided to
   support Internet transport addresses that include a zone index.  In
   order to support arbitrary combinations of scoped Internet transport
   addresses, MIB authors SHOULD use a separate TransportDomain or
   TransportAddressType objects for each TransportAddress object.

   There are two different ways how new transport domains and textual
   conventions for the address formats used by those new transport
   domains can be defined.

   1. The MIB module contained in this memo can be updated and new
      constants for the TransportDomain and the TransportAddressType
      enumeration can be assigned.

   2. Other MIB modules may define additional transport domains and
      associated textual conventions.  Such an extension can not update
      the TransportAddressType enumeration.

RFC 3419      Textual Conventions for Transport Addresses  December 2002


   It is therefore a MIB designers choice whether he uses (a) a more
   compact TransportAddressType object with limited extensibility or (b)
   a more verbose TransportDomain object which allows arbitrary
   extensions in other MIB modules.

   The MIB module contained in this memo does NOT define the transport
   mappings of any particular protocol.  Rather, it defines a set of
   common identifiers and textual conventions that are intended to be
   used within various transport mappings documents.

3.1 Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section discusses how the definitions provided by the MIB module
   contained in this memo relate to definitions in other MIB modules.

3.1.1 SNMPv2-TC (TAddress, TDomain)

   The SNMPv2-TC MIB module [RFC2579] defines the textual conventions
   TAddress and TDomain to represent generic transport addresses.

   A TAddress is an octet string with a size between 1 and 255 octets.
   Experience has shown that there is sometimes a need to represent
   unknown transport addresses.  The MIB module contained in this memo
   therefore introduces a new textual convention TransportAddress which
   is an octet string with a size between 0 and 255 octets and otherwise
   identical semantics.  In other words, the sub-type TransportAddress
   (SIZE (1..255)) is identical with the TAddress defined in the
   SNMPv2-TC MIB module [RFC2579].

   This MIB module also introduces a new textual convention
   TransportDomain which is compatible with the TDomain definition so
   that a complete set of definitions is contained in a single MIB
   module.  New MIB modules SHOULD use the generic TransportDomain,
   TransportAddressType and TransportAddress definitions defined in this
   memo.  Existing MIB modules may be updated to use the definitions
   provided in this memo by replacing TDomain with TransportDomain and
   TAddress with TransportAddress (SIZE (1..255)).

3.1.2 SNMPv2-TM

   The transport domain values defined in the SNMPv2-TM MIB module
   [RFC3417] all contain "snmp" as the prefix in their name and are
   registered under `snmpDomains' (from RFC 2578 [RFC2578]).  They were
   originally intended to describe SNMP transport domains only - but
   they were later also used for non-SNMP transport endpoints.  These
   definitions are also incomplete since new transport address domains
   are needed to support (at least) SNMP over UDP over IPv6.

RFC 3419      Textual Conventions for Transport Addresses  December 2002


   The transport domain values defined in this memo are independent of
   the protocol running over the transport-layer and SHOULD be used for
   all transport endpoints not carrying SNMP traffic.  Programs that
   interpret transport domain values should in addition accept the
   transport domain values defined in the SNMPv2-TM MIB module in order
   to provide interoperability with existing implementations that use
   the SNMP specific transport domain values.

   Transport endpoints which carry SNMP traffic SHOULD continue to use
   the definitions from the SNMPv2-TM MIB module where applicable.  They
   SHOULD use the transport domain values defined in this memo for SNMP
   transports not defined in the SNMPv2-TM MIB module, such as SNMP over
   UDP over IPv6.  Programs that interpret transport domain values
   should in addition accept all the transport domain values defined in
   this memo in order to provide interoperability in cases where it is
   not possible or desirable to distinguish the protocols running over a
   transport endpoint.

3.1.3 INET-ADDRESS-MIB (InetAddressType, InetAddress)

   The INET-ADDRESS-MIB MIB module [RFC3291] defines the textual
   conventions InetAddressType and InetAddress to represent Internet
   network layer endpoints.  Some MIB modules use these textual
   conventions in conjunction with the InetPortNumber textual convention
   to represent Internet transport-layer endpoints.  This approach is
   fine as long as a MIB models protocols or applications that are
   specific to the Internet suite of transport protocols.  For protocols
   or applications that can potentially use other transport protocols,
   the use of the definitions contained in this memo is more
   appropriate.

         specify the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain object
         which provides the context. Furthermore, MIB authors SHOULD
         define a separate TransportAddressType or TransportDomain
         object for each TransportAddress object. It is suggested that
         the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain is logically
         registered before the object(s) which use the
         TransportAddress textual convention if they appear in the
         same logical row.

6. Security Considerations

   The MIB module contained in this memo does not define any management
   objects.  Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may
   be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB
   modules that define concrete management objects.  This document has
   therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.
