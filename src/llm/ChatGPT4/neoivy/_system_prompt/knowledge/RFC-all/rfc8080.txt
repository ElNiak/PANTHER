      Edwards-Curve Digital Security Algorithm (EdDSA) for DNSSEC

Abstract

   This document describes how to specify Edwards-curve Digital Security
   Algorithm (EdDSA) keys and signatures in DNS Security (DNSSEC).  It
   uses EdDSA with the choice of two curves: Ed25519 and Ed448.

1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC, which is broadly defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and
   [RFC4035], uses cryptographic keys and digital signatures to provide
   authentication of DNS data.  Currently, the most popular signature
   algorithm in use is RSA.  GOST [RFC5933] and NIST-specified elliptic
   curve cryptography [RFC6605] are also standardized.

   [RFC8032] describes the elliptic curve signature system Edwards-curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) and recommends two curves,
   Ed25519 and Ed448.

   This document defines the use of DNSSEC's DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG
   resource records (RRs) with a new signing algorithm, EdDSA, using a
   choice of two curves: Ed25519 and Ed448.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  DNSKEY Resource Records

   An Ed25519 public key consists of a 32-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Public Key field of a DNSKEY resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The generation of a public key is defined in Section 5.1.5
   of [RFC8032].

RFC 8080                    EdDSA for DNSSEC               February 2017


   An Ed448 public key consists of a 57-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Public Key field of a DNSKEY resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The generation of a public key is defined in Section 5.2.5
   of [RFC8032].

4.  RRSIG Resource Records

   An Ed25519 signature consists of a 64-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The Ed25519 signature algorithm and verification of the
   Ed25519 signature are described in Sections 5.1.6 and 5.1.7 of
   [RFC8032], respectively.

   An Ed448 signature consists of a 114-octet value, which is encoded
   into the Signature field of an RRSIG resource record as a simple bit
   string.  The Ed448 signature algorithm and verification of the Ed448
   signature are described in Sections 5.2.6 and 5.2.7 of [RFC8032],
   respectively.

5.  Algorithm Number for DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG Resource Records

   The algorithm number associated with the use of Ed25519 in DS,
   DNSKEY, and RRSIG resource records is 15.  The algorithm number
   associated with the use of Ed448 in DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG resource
   records is 16.  This registration is fully defined in the IANA
   Considerations section.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the IANA registry "Domain Name System Security
   (DNSSEC) Algorithm Numbers".  The following entries have been added
   to the registry:

                  +--------------+----------+----------+
                  | Number       | 15       | 16       |
                  | Description  | Ed25519  | Ed448    |
                  | Mnemonic     | ED25519  | ED448    |
                  | Zone Signing | Y        | Y        |
                  | Trans. Sec.  | *        | *        |
                  | Reference    | RFC 8080 | RFC 8080 |
                  +--------------+----------+----------+

    * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of
                 this algorithm with Transaction Security.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8032] and [RFC7748] are inherited
   in the usage of Ed25519 and Ed448 in DNSSEC.

   Ed25519 is intended to operate at around the 128-bit security level
   and Ed448 at around the 224-bit security level.  A sufficiently large
   quantum computer would be able to break both.  Reasonable projections
   of the abilities of classical computers conclude that Ed25519 is

   perfectly safe.  Ed448 is provided for those applications with
   relaxed performance requirements and where there is a desire to hedge
   against analytical attacks on elliptic curves.

   These assessments could, of course, change in the future if new
   attacks that work better than the ones known today are found.

   A private key used for a DNSSEC zone MUST NOT be used for any other
   purpose than for that zone.  Otherwise, cross-protocol or cross-
   application attacks are possible.
