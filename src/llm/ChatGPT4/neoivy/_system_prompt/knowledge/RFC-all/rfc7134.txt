  The Management Policy of the Resource Priority Header (RPH) Registry
                        Changed to "IETF Review"

Abstract

   RFC 4412 defines the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" and "Resource-
   Priority Priority-values" registries.  The management policy of these
   registries is "Standards Action".  This document normatively updates
   RFC 4412 to change the management policy of these registries to "IETF
   Review".

RFC 7134                 RPH Registry Management              March 2014


1.  Introduction

   [RFC4412] defines the "Resource-Priority Namespaces" and "Resource-
   Priority Priority-values" registries.  The management policy of these
   registries is "Standards Action" [RFC5226].  Experience suggests that
   a document that only defines a new namespace with its priorities, and
   does not create new protocol semantics, should not be a Standards-
   Track document.  Therefore, this document updates [RFC4412] to change
   the management policy of the registries to "IETF Review".

2.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security considerations beyond
   those discussed in [RFC4412].

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has changed the management policy of the "Resource-Priority
   Namespaces" and "Resource-Priority Priority-values" registries to
   "IETF Review" [RFC5226].
