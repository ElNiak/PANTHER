                    IPv6 Testing Address Allocation

   This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
   community.  It does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.

1.0 Introduction

   This document describes an allocation plan for IPv6 addresses to be
   used in testing IPv6 prototype software.  These addresses are
   temporary and will be reclaimed in the future.  Any IPv6 system using
   these addresses will have to renumber at some time in the future.
   These addresses will not to be routable in the Internet other than
   for IPv6 testing.

   The address format for the IPv6 test address is consistent with the
   "Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Allocation" [AGGR] and "TLA and
   NLA Assignment Rules" [TLAASN].

   This document is intended to replace RFC 1897 "IPv6 Testing Address
   Allocation", January 1996.  RFC 1897 will become historic.

   The addresses described in this document are consistent with the IPv6
   Addressing Architecture [ARCH].  They may be assigned to nodes
   manually, with IPv6 Auto Address Allocation [AUTO], or with DHCP for
   IPv6 [DHCPv6].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.0 Address Format

   The Aggregatable Global Unicast Address Allocation format defined in
   [AGGR] is as follows:

      | 3 |  13 |    32     |   16   |          64 bits               |
      +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+
      |FP | TLA | NLA ID    | SLA ID |         Interface ID           |
      |   | ID  |           |        |                                |
      +---+-----+-----------+--------+--------------------------------+

   where:

      FP = 001 = Format Prefix

           This is the Format Prefix used to identify aggregatable
           global unicast addresses.

      TLA = 0x1FFE = Top-Level Aggregation Identifier

           This is a TLA ID assigned by the IANA for 6bone testing under
           the auspices of the IETF IPng Transition Working Group 6bone
           testbed activity.  It is to be administered by the chair of
           the 6bone activity (currently Bob Fink <rlfink@lbl.gov>).
           The use of this TLA ID is temporary.  All users of these
           addresses in this TLA ID will be required to renumber at some
           time in the future.

      NLA ID = Next-Level Aggregation Identifier

           The NLA ID space will be assigned, by the TLA ID
           administrator, in an addressing hierarchy sufficient to
           identify transit networks and end user sites consistent with
           the architecture and topology of the 6bone. This will provide
           a multi-level transit service consistent with the 6bone goals
           of fully testing IPv6 technology in real use environments.

      SLA ID = Site-Level Aggregation Identifier

           The SLA ID field is used by an individual organization to
           create its own local addressing hierarchy and to identify
           subnets.  Assignment of the SLA ID field is the
           responsibility of each individual organization.

      Interface ID

           This is the interface identifier of the interface on the link
           as defined in the appropriate IPv6 over <link> document, such
           as [ETHER], [FDDI], etc.

5.0 Security Considerations

   This document defines a test approach for creating aggregatable
   address consistent with [AGGR].  It does not have any direct impact
   on Internet infrastructure security.  Authentication of IPv6 packets
   is defined in [AUTH].
