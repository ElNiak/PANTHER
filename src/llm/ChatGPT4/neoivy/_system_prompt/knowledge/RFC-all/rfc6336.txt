 IANA Registry for Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Options

Abstract

   It has been identified that "Interactive Connectivity Establishment
   (ICE): A Protocol for Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for
   Offer/Answer Protocols" (RFC 5245) is missing a registry for ICE
   options.  This document defines this missing IANA registry and
   updates RFC 5245.

1.  Introduction

   "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for Network
   Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer Protocols"
   [RFC5245] defines a concept of ICE options.  However, the ICE RFC
   fails to create an IANA registry for ICE options.  As one ICE option
   is under specification in [ECN-FOR-RTP], there is now a need to
   create the registry.

   RFC 5245 says: "ICE provides for extensibility by allowing an offer
   or answer to contain a series of tokens that identify the ICE
   extensions used by that agent.  If an agent supports an ICE
   extension, it MUST include the token defined for that extension in
   the ice-options attribute".

   Thus, as future extensions are defined, these ICE options need to be
   registered with IANA to ensure non-conflicting identification.  The
   ICE option identifiers are used in signalling between the ICE
   endpoints to negotiate extension support.  RFC 5245 defines one
   method of signalling these ICE options, using the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) with Offer/Answer [RFC3264].

   This document updates the ICE specification [RFC5245] to define the
   "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) Options" registry.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a registry "Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) Options" for ICE options that can be used in the
   SDP "ice-options" attribute or other signalling parameters carrying
   the ICE options.

3.1.  ICE Options

   An ICE option identifier MUST fulfill the ABNF [RFC5234] syntax for
   "ice-option-tag" as specified in [RFC5245].  This syntax is
   reproduced here for simplicity, but the authoritative definition is
   in the ICE RFC:

   ice-option-tag        = 1*ice-char
   ice-char              = ALPHA / DIGIT / "+" / "/"

   ICE options are of unlimited length according to the syntax; however,
   they are RECOMMENDED to be no longer than 20 characters.  This is to
   reduce message sizes and allow for efficient parsing.

   Registration of an ICE option in the "Interactive Connectivity
   Establishment (ICE) Options" registry is done using the Specification
   Required policy as defined in "Guidelines for Writing an IANA
   Considerations Section in RFCs" [RFC5226].

   A registration request MUST include the following information:

   o  The ICE option identifier to be registered

   o  Name, Email, and Address of a contact person for the registration

   o  Organization or individuals having the change control

   o  Short description of the ICE extension to which the option relates

   o  Reference(s) to the specification defining the ICE option and the
      related extensions

   This document registers no ICE option.

4.  Security Considerations

   As this document defines an IANA registry for an already existing
   concept, there are no new security considerations.
