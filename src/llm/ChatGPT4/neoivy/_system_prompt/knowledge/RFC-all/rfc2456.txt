1.  Introduction

   This document is a product of the SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group.
   It defines a MIB module for notifications for devices with Advanced
   Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN) and Dependent LU Requester (DLUR)
   capabilities.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [13].

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC
        1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and
        RFC 2274 [12].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

RFC 2456                     APPN TRAPS MIB                November 1998


   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   This document identifies the set of objects for reporting the status
   of devices with APPN and DLUR capabilities via notifications.

   See the SNANAU APPN MIB [18] and SNANAU DLUR MIB [19] for the objects
   for monitoring the configuration and active characteristics of the
   devices with APPN and DLUR capabilities. Many objects contained in
   the notifications of this MIB are imported from the APPN and DLUR
   MIBs.  Implementors of this MIB must also implement the APPN MIB.
   Implementations that support the appnTrapMibDlurConfGroup and the
   appnTrapMibDlurNotifGroup must also implement the DLUR MIB.

   The SNANAU APPN MIB allows a management station to collect the
   network topology of an APPN network (the network nodes (NNs) in the
   network and all of transmission groups (TGs) between the network
   nodes) from an APPN device.  It also allows the management station to
   collect the local topology (TGs to end stations, and locally defined
   ports and link stations) from an APPN device.  While the SNANAU APPN
   MIB has an efficient way to poll the APPN device for updates to the
   network topology, using flow reduction sequence numbers (FRSNs) as a
   table index; it does not have a mechanism to poll the local topology
   tables (appnLocalTgTable, appnPortTable, and appnLsTable) for status
   changes.

   This MIB provides a mechanism for an APPN device to send
   notifications to inform the management station of status changes to
   rows of these tables. Status changes include operational state
   changes, and for TGs also include control-point to control-point
   (CP-CP) session state changes.  A notification is defined for each
   type of status change for each table.

   The port and link operational state objects have intermediate states.
   Notifications are only sent for transition to active or inactive
   state.






Clouston & Moore            Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 2456                     APPN TRAPS MIB                November 1998


   Notifications are only sent for row creation if the state is active
   or operational.  This is done to avoid sending a notification as the
   row is created with an inactive initial state, followed by another
   notification as the resource is activated.

   Notifications are only sent for row deletion if the last state was
   active or operational.  In most cases, a resource must be deactivated
   before it can be deleted, and the deactivation will cause a
   notification to be sent.  There is no need for a second notification
   to be sent for the row deletion, except for the case where the
   deletion occurred without deactivation.  In this case, the state of
   the object in the notification will indicate an inactve state, since
   a deleted resource can no longer be active.

   The purpose of the appnLocalTgCpCpStateChangeTrap notification is to
   identify the loss or recovery of CP-CP sessions on a TG while the TG
   remains operational.  Thus this notification is only sent if there is
   a change to an appnLocalTgCpCpSession object, but not a change to the
   appnLocalTgOperational object.  This notification is never sent for
   the creation or deletion of a row in the appnLocalTgTable.

   Each notification always contains an object which is a count of the
   number of times the status of a row in table has changed since the
   APPN node was last reinitialized.  This enables a management station
   to detect that it has missed a notification, if it does not get the
   notifications in numerical sequence.  If the notifications are not in
   sequence, the management station should retrieve the entire table to
   get the correct status for all rows.

   Similarly, the SNANAU DLUR MIB provides a mechanism for retrieving
   the configuration and status of dependent LU server (DLUS) sessions
   on a device with DLUR capabilities.  This MIB defines a notification
   for a DLUR-DLUS session state change of a row in the dlurDlusTable,
   in the manner described above.  A notification is only sent for a
   session state transition to active or inactive.  As with the above
   notifications, it is only sent on row creation if the initial state
   is active; and on row deletion is the last state was active, in which
   case the notification indicates that the state is now inactive.

   The SNANAU APPN MIB also provides a mechanism for a management
   station to collect traffic statistics on intermediate sessions,
   primarily for accounting purposes.  However, when the session is
   terminated, all statistics from the last poll until the session
   termination time are lost, since the row for that session is deleted
   from the appnIsInTable.  This MIB defines a notification so that the
   session's final statistics can be sent to a management station.  If
   the notification is not delivered, the final session statistics are
   lost.  If this is a concern, polling of the appnIsInTable in the APPN



Clouston & Moore            Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2456                     APPN TRAPS MIB                November 1998


   MIB should be increased to more likely reduce the time between the
   last poll and the session termination, thereby reducing the amount of
   data lost.

   Highlights of the management functions supported by the APPN TRAP MIB
   module include the following:

   o    A notification for an APPN local TG operational state change.

   o    A notification for an APPN local TG CP-CP session state change.

   o    A notification for an APPN port operational state change.

   o    A notification for an APPN link station operational state
        change.

   o    A notification for a DLUR-DLUS session state change.

   o    A notification for reporting final APPN intermediate session
        statistics.

   This MIB module does not support:

   o    Objects to query the configuration or status of APPN nodes on
        demand.

   o    Notifications for changes to local topology tables not related
        to status.

3.1.  APPN TRAP MIB Structure

   The APPN TRAP MIB module contains a group of notifications, and a
   group of supporting objects.

   The group of notifications consists of the following notifications:

   1) appnIsrAccountingDataTrap

   This notification is generated by an APPN device when an intermediate
   session is terminating, to report the final accounting statistics of
   the session.

   2) appnLocalTgOperStateChangeTrap

   This notification identifies a change to the appnLocalTgOperational
   object in a row of the SNANAU APPN MIB appnLocalTgTable.

RFC 2456                     APPN TRAPS MIB                November 1998


   3) appnLocalTgCpCpStateChangeTrap

   This notification identifies a change to the appnLocalTgCpCpSession
   object in a row of the SNANAU APPN MIB appnLocalTgTable.

   4) appnPortOperStateChangeTrap

   This notification identifies a change to the appnPortOperState object
   in a row of the SNANAU APPN MIB appnPortTable.

   5) appnLsOperStateChangeTrap

   This notification identifies a change to the appnLsOperState object
   in a row of the SNANAU APPN MIB appnLsTable.

   6) dlurDlusStateChangeTrap

   This notification identifies a change to the dlurDlusSessnStatus
   object in a row of the SNANAU DLUR MIB dlurDlusTable.

   The group of supporting objects contains the appnTrapControl object,
   which controls whether the APPN device generates each type of
   notification.  Note that generation of the appnIsrAccountingDataTrap
   is not controlled by this object; instead it is controlled by the
   appnIsInGlobalCtrAdminStatus object in the SNANAU APPN MIB.

   Although APPN notification generation could be controlled solely by
   entries in the snmpNotificationMIB, RFC 2273 [9], the appnTrapControl
   object exists in this MIB so that implementations are not required to
   implement RFC 2273 to control generation of APPN notifications.  For
   a notification to be generated and sent as a TRAP or INFORM, the
   notification type must first be enabled by the appnTrapControl
   object.  It must also not be disabled by an snmpNotificationMIB
   entry.  The destination of notifications is not within the scope of
   this MIB.

   Also contained in this group are objects for the TG, port, link, and
   DLUR-DLUS session notifications to indicate the number of times each
   of the tables has had a status change of a row since the APPN node
   was last reinitialized.

          "When it has been enabled, this notification is generated by an
          APPN node whenever an ISR session passing through the node is
          taken down, regardless of whether the session went down
          normally or abnormally.  Its purpose is to allow a management
          application (primarily an accounting application) that is
          monitoring the ISR counts to receive the final values of these
          counts, so that the application can properly account for the
          amounts the counts were incremented since the last time the
          application polled them.  The appnIsInSessUpTime object
          provides the total amount of time that the session was active.

          This notification is not a substitute for polling the ISR
          counts.  In particular, the count values reported in this
          notification cannot be assumed to be the complete totals for
          the life of the session, since they may have wrapped while the
          session was up.

          The session to which the objects in this notification apply is
          identified by the fully qualified CP name and PCID that make up
          the table index.  An instance of this notification will contain
          exactly one instance of each of its objects, and these objects
          will all belong to the same conceptual row of the
          appnIsInTable.

          Generation of this notification is controlled by the same
          object in the APPN MIB, appnIsInGlobeCtrAdminStatus, that
          controls whether the count objects themselves are being
          incremented."

          This notification is sent whenever there is a change to
          the appnLocalTgOperational object in a row of the

          'true'.  In this case, the value of appnLocalTgOperational
          in the notification shall be 'false', since the deletion of
          a row indicates that the TG is no longer operational.

          The notification is more than a simple 'poll me now' indication.
          It carries both a count of local TG topology changes, and the
          current operational state itself.  The count of changes allows an
          application to detect lost notifications, either when polling
          or upon receiving a subsequent notification, at which point it
          knows it must retrieve the entire appnLocalTgTable again.
          This is the same count as used in the appnLocalCpCpStateChangeTrap.
          A lost notification could indicate a local TG CP-CP session state

5.  Security Considerations

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information SHOULD be employed in such environments.  An
   authentication protocol is defined in [12].  A protocol for access
   control is defined in [15].

   None of the read-only objects in the APPN TRAP MIB reports a
   password, user data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.
   Some enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as
   information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets;
   such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the
   objects in the MIB.

   There is one read-write object in the APPN TRAP MIB, appnTrapControl.
   This object controls the generation of the notifications defined in
   the APPN TRAP MIB.
