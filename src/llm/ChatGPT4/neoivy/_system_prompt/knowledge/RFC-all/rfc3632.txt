RFC 3632                  VeriSign RRP v2.0.0              November 2003


1.  Introduction

   The Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI) Registry Registrar Protocol (RRP)
   was developed by NSI in 1998 and 1999 to allow multiple registrars to
   provide second level Internet domain name registration services in
   the top level domains (TLDs) administered by the NSI TLD registry.
   Version 1.1.0 of the NSI RRP was published as Informational RFC 2832
   [2] in May 2000.  This document describes changes to RFC 2832 that
   specify version 2.0.0 of the protocol.

   Conventions Used In This Document

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
      in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC
      2119 [1].

      In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and
      "S:"  represents lines returned by a protocol server.

2.  Protocol Updates

   This specification describes several modifications to RFC 2832 [2]:
   two new response codes have been added, domain TRANSFER command
   processing has been updated to allow a client to cancel a requested
   domain transfer, and support for IPv6 name server addresses has been
   added.

2.1.  Response Codes

   Section 5.1 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include two
   additional error response codes.

   510 Invalid encoding

   The value of a domain name or name server entity contains invalid
   ASCII compatible encoding used to represent an internationalized
   domain or host name.  The encoding is checked and verified in two
   situations: when registering an internationalized domain name or name
   server name, and when changing the name of a name server and the new
   name of the server is internationalized.

RFC 3632                  VeriSign RRP v2.0.0              November 2003


   Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include response code
   510 as a possible error value returned from the ADD command:

   Command: ADD
   Success: 200, 220
   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 520, 531,
   535, 540, 541, 545, 546, 547, 549, 550, 554

   557 Name server locked

   An attempt has been made to modify or delete a name server that is
   hosting a TLD in the root zone.  Modifications to the root zone can
   only be made with the approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce and
   IANA, so if the registrar absolutely needs to modify or delete such a
   name server, the action needs to be coordinated through the registry
   operator using an out-of-band communications channel.

   Section 5.2 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include response code
   557 as a possible error value returned from the DEL and MOD commands:

   Command: DEL
   Success: 200, 220
   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 520, 531, 532,
   533, 541, 544, 545, 547, 549, 551, 552, 553, 557

   Command: MOD
   Success: 200, 220
   Failure: 420, 421, 500, 502, 503, 504, 505, 507, 508, 510, 520, 531,
   535, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 547, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 557

2.2.  TRANSFER Command Update

   Section 4.3.10 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include an
   additional TRANSFER command processing option.

   Old text:

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to
   request the transfer of registration service authority to the
   requesting registrar.  Only the current sponsoring registrar of a
   domain name may explicitly approve or reject a requested transfer.
   The registry MAY implicitly approve or reject requested transfers
   after a fixed amount of time.

RFC 3632                  VeriSign RRP v2.0.0              November 2003


   New text:

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to
   request transfer of registration service authority to the requesting
   registrar.  Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name
   may explicitly approve a requested transfer.  The current sponsoring
   registrar MAY explicitly reject a requested transfer.  The registry
   MAY implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed
   amount of time.  The requesting registrar MAY cancel a pending
   request, but the request to cancel the transfer MUST be sent before
   it has been explicitly approved or rejected by the current sponsoring
   registrar or it has been implicitly approved or rejected by the
   registry.

   Example:

   A registrar cancels a previously requested domain transfer:

   C:transfer<crlf>
   C:-Approve:No<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

2.3.  IPv6 Name Server Addresses

   Section 7 of RFC 2832 [2] has been updated to include support for
   name servers using IPv6 addresses.  IPv6 addressing architecture is
   described in RFC 3513 [3].  This ABNF [4] grammar supplements the
   grammar defined in RFC 2832.

   ; Lexical Tokens

   hexdigit = digit / %X41-46 / %x61-66   ; 0-9 / A-F / a-f

   doubleoctet = 1*4hexdigit

   docolon = doubleoctet colon

   colondo = colon doubleoctet

   ip-address =  ip-address-v4 / ip-address-v6

   ; ipv4 addresses
   ip-address-v4 = 1*3digit dot 1*3digit dot 1*3digit dot 1*3digit

   ip-address-v6 =  ip-address-v6-standard / ip-address-v6-compressed
   ; Standard form of IPv6 addresses
   ; 8 hexdigit strings of length 1-4 separated by colons
   ;
   ; Eg: 10AA:0:0:00:8:800:200C:417A

   ip-address-v6-standard = doubleoctet 7colondo

   ; Compressed form of IPv6 addresses
