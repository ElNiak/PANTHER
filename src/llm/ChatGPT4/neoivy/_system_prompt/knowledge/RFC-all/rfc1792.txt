                  TCP/IPX Connection Mib Specification

Status of this Memo

   This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet
   community.  This does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.
   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

IESG Note:

   Internet Engineering Steering Group comment from the Area Director
   for Transport Services: Please note well that this memo is an
   individual product of the author.  Implementation experience,
   particularly on the effectiveness of the protocols in dual-stack
   environments, is needed.

1.  Introduction

   Traditionally, TCP and UDP runs over IP.  STD 17, RFC 1213 defines
   TCP connection MIB object and UDP listener object assuming just that.
   For TCP and UDP running over IPX, tcpConnTable and udpTable objects
   from RFC 1213 cannot be used since they define the address to be of
   type IpAddress.  As such, we need to define new objects that can
   properly describe TCP and UDP connections over IPX.

   New MIB objects, tcpIpxConnTable, udpIpxTable, tcpUnspecConnTable and
   udpUnspecTable are presented in this paper, to be used in place of
   tcpConnTable and udpListenerTable when TCP and UDP are running over
   IPX.
