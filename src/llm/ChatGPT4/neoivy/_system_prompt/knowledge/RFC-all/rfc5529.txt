   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher
   algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, Counter (CTR) mode,
   and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode as additional, optional-to-

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Camellia block cipher
   algorithm [1] in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, Counter (CTR)
   mode, and Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode as additional, optional-to-
   implement IKEv2 [2] and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [3]
   mechanisms to provide confidentiality, data origin authentication,
   and connectionless integrity.

   Since optimized source code is provided under several open source
   licenses [9], Camellia is also adopted by several open source
   projects (OpenSSL, FreeBSD, Linux, and Firefox Gran Paradiso).

   The algorithm specification and object identifiers are described in
   [1].

   The Camellia web site [10] contains a wealth of information about
   Camellia, including detailed specification, security analysis,
   performance figures, reference implementation, optimized
   implementation, test vectors, and intellectual property information.

   The remainder of this document specifies the use of various modes of
   operation for Camellia within the context of IPsec ESP.  For further
   information on how the various pieces of IPsec in general and ESP in
   particular fit together to provide security services, please refer to
   [11] and [3].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [4].

2.  The Camellia Cipher Algorithm

   All symmetric block cipher algorithms share common characteristics
   and variables, including mode, key size, weak keys, block size, and
   rounds.  The relevant characteristics of Camellia are described in
   [1].

2.1.  Block Size and Padding

   Camellia uses a block size of 16 octets (128 bits).

   Padding requirements are described:

   (a)  Camellia Padding requirement is specified in [3],
   (b)  Camellia-CBC Padding requirement is specified in [3],
   (c)  Camellia-CCM Padding requirement is specified in [5], and
   (d)  ESP Padding requirement is specified in [3].

2.2.  Performance

   Performance figures for Camellia are available at [10].  The NESSIE
   project has reported on the performance of optimized implementations
   independently [12].

3.  Modes

   This document describes three modes of operation for the use of
   Camellia with IPsec: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining), CTR (Counter), and
   CCM (Counter with CBC-MAC).

3.1.  Cipher Block Chaining

   Camellia CBC mode is defined in [6].

3.2.  Counter and Counter with CBC-MAC

   Camellia in CTR and CCM modes is used in IPsec as AES in [7] and [8].
   In this specification, CCM is used with the Camellia [13] block
   cipher.

4.  IKEv2 Conventions

   This section describes the transform ID and conventions used to
   generate keying material for use with ENCR_CAMELLIA_CBC,
   ENCR_CAMELLIA_CTR, and ENCR_CAMELLIA_CCM using the Internet Key
   Exchange (IKEv2) [2].

4.1.  Keying Material

   The size of KEYMAT MUST be equal or longer than the associated
   Camellia key.  The keying material is used as follows:

   Camellia-CBC with a 128-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is 16 octets.  All
      16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key.

   Camellia-CBC with a 192-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is 24 octets.  All
      24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key.

   Camellia-CBC with a 256-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CBC key is 32 octets.  All
      32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key.

   Camellia-CTR with a 128-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR key is 20 octets.  The
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CTR with a 192-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR key is 28 octets.  The
      first 24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CTR with a 256-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CTR key is 36 octets.  The
      first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      four octets are used as the nonce value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CCM with a 128-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 19 octets.  The
      first 16 octets are the 128-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      three octets are used as the salt value in the counter block.

   Camellia-CCM with a 192-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 27 octets.  The
      first 24 octets are the 192-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      three octets are used as the salt value in the counter block.

RFC 5529       Modes of Operation for Camellia for IPsec      April 2009


   Camellia-CCM with a 256-bit key
      The KEYMAT requested for each Camellia-CCM key is 35 octets.  The
      first 32 octets are the 256-bit Camellia key, and the remaining
      three octets are used as the salt value in the counter block.

4.2.  Transform Type 1

   For IKEv2 negotiations, IANA has assigned five ESP Transform
   Identifiers for Camellia-CBC, Camellia-CTR, and Camellia-CCM, as
   recorded in Section 6.

4.3.  Key Length Attribute

   Since Camellia supports three key lengths, the Key Length attribute
   MUST be specified in the IKE exchange [2].  The Key Length attribute
   MUST have a value of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

5.  Security Considerations

   For security considerations of CTR and CCM mode, this document refers
   to Section 9 of [7] and Section 7 of [8].

   No security problem has been found for Camellia [14], [12].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned IKEv2 parameters for use with Camellia-CTR and with
   Camellia-CCM for Transform Type 1 (Encryption Algorithm):

         23 for ENCR_CAMELLIA_CBC;
         24 for ENCR_CAMELLIA_CTR;
         25 for ENCR_CAMELLIA_CCM with an 8-octet ICV;
         26 for ENCR_CAMELLIA_CCM with a 12-octet ICV; and
         27 for ENCR_CAMELLIA_CCM with a 16-octet ICV.
