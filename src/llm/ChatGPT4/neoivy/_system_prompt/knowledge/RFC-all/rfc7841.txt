                 RFC Streams, Headers, and Boilerplates

Abstract

   RFC documents contain a number of fixed elements such as the title
   page header, standard boilerplates, and copyright/IPR statements.
   This document describes them and introduces some updates to reflect
   current usage and requirements of RFC publication.  In particular,
   this updated structure is intended to communicate clearly the source
   of RFC creation and review.  This document obsoletes RFC 5741, moving
   detailed content to an IAB web page and preparing for more flexible
   output formats.

1.  Introduction

   Previously, RFCs (e.g., [RFC4844]) contained a number of elements
   that were there for historical, practical, and legal reasons.  They
   also contained boilerplate material to clearly indicate the status of
   the document and possibly contained "Notes" to indicate how the
   document interacts with IETF Standards-Track documents.

   As the RFC Series has evolved over the years, there has been
   increasing concern over appropriate labeling of the publications to
   make clear the status of each RFC and the status of the work it
   describes.  Chiefly, there is a requirement that RFCs published as
   part of the IETF's review process not be easily confused with RFCs
   that may have had a very different review and approval process.
   Various adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving
   text of "Notes" included in the published RFC.

   With the definition of the different RFC streams [RFC4844], it is
   appropriate to formalize the definition of the various pieces of
   standard RFC boilerplate and introduce some adjustments to ensure



Halpern, et al.               Informational                     [Page 2]

RFC 7841           RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates           May 2016


   better clarity of expression of document status, aligned with the
   review and approval processes defined for each stream.

   This memo identifies and describes the common elements of RFC
   boilerplate structure.  It describes the content required for each
   kind of information.  Details of the exact textual and layout
   requirements are left to a web page maintained by the IAB, with due
   consultation with the community, for ease of maintenance.  This
   document obsoletes [RFC5741].

   The changes introduced by this memo should be implemented as soon as
   practically possible after the document has been approved for
   publication.

2.  RFC Streams and Internet Standards

   Users of RFCs should be aware that while all Internet Standards-
   related documents are published as RFCs, not all RFCs are Internet
   Standards-related documents.

   The IETF is responsible for maintaining the Internet Standards
   Process, which includes the requirements for developing, reviewing,
   and approving Standards Track and BCP RFCs.  The IETF also produces
   non-Standards-Track documents (Informational, Experimental, and
   Historic).  All documents published as part of the IETF Stream are
   reviewed by the appropriate IETF bodies.

   Documents published in streams other than the IETF stream are not
   generally reviewed by the IETF for such things as security,
   congestion control, or inappropriate interaction with deployed
   protocols.  They have also not been subject to approval by the
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), including an IETF-wide
   last call.  Therefore, the IETF disclaims, for any of the non-IETF
   stream documents, any knowledge of the fitness of those RFCs for any
   purpose.

   Refer to [RFC2026], [RFC5742], [RFC4844], [RFC6410], and [RFC7127]
   and their successors for current details of the IETF process and RFC
   streams.

3.  RFC Structural Elements

   This section describes the elements that are commonly found in RFCs
   published today.  This document specifies information that is
   required in these publications.  Exact specification of the textual
   values required therein are provided by an IAB web page
   (https://www.iab.org/documents/headers-boilerplate).

RFC 7841           RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates           May 2016


   As noted above, this web page is maintained by the IAB with due
   consultation with the community.  Following such consultation, if the
   IAB decides to make any changes to this material, the changes will be
   announced in a similar fashion to other IAB statements.  The initial
   text to be used in that web page is included in Appendix A.

3.1.  The Title Page Header

   The information at the front of the RFC includes the name and
   affiliation of the authors as well as the RFC publication month and
   year.

   There is a set of additional information that is needed at the front
   of the RFC.  Historically, this has been presented with the
   information below in a left hand column, and the author-related
   information described above in the right.

   <document source>  This describes the area where the work originates.
      Historically, all RFCs were labeled "Network Working Group".
      Network Working Group refers to the original version of today's
      IETF when people from the original set of ARPANET sites and
      whomever else was interested -- the meetings were open -- got
      together to discuss, design, and document proposed protocols
      [RFC3].  Here, we obsolete the term "Network Working Group" in
      order to indicate the originating stream.

      The <document source> is the name of the RFC stream, as defined in
      [RFC4844] and its successors.  At the time of this publication,
      the streams, and therefore the possible entries are:

      *  Internet Engineering Task Force
      *  Internet Architecture Board
      *  Internet Research Task Force
      *  Independent Submission

   Request for Comments:  <RFC number>  This indicates the RFC number,
      assigned by the RFC Editor upon publication of the document.  This
      element is unchanged.

   <subseries ID> <subseries number>  Some document categories are also
      labeled as a subseries of RFCs.  These elements appear as
      appropriate for such categories, indicating the subseries and the
      documents number within that series.  Currently, there are
      subseries for BCPs [RFC2026] and STDs [RFC1311].  These subseries
      numbers may appear in several RFCs.  For example, when a new RFC
      obsoletes or updates an old one, the same subseries number is
      used.  Also, several RFCs may be assigned the same subseries
      number: a single STD, for example, may be composed of several



Halpern, et al.               Informational                     [Page 4]

RFC 7841           RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates           May 2016


      RFCs, each of which will bear the same STD number.  This element
      is unchanged.

   [<RFC relation>:<RFC number[s]>]  Some relations between RFCs in the
      series are explicitly noted in the RFC header.  For example, a new
      RFC may update one or more earlier RFCs.  Currently two
      relationships are defined: "Updates" and "Obsoletes" [RFC7322].
      Variants like "Obsoleted by" are also used (e.g, in [RFC5143]).
      Other types of relationships may be defined by the RFC Editor and
      may appear in future RFCs.

   Category: <category>  This indicates the initial RFC document
      category of the publication.  These are defined in [RFC2026].
      Currently, this is always one of: Standards Track, Best Current
      Practice, Experimental, Informational, or Historic.  This element
      is unchanged.

3.2.  The Status of This Memo

   The "Status of This Memo" describes the category of the RFC,
   including the distribution statement.

   The "Status of This Memo" will start with a single sentence
   describing the status.  It will also include a statement describing
   the stream-specific review of the material (which is stream
   dependent).  This is an important component of status, insofar as it
   clarifies the breadth and depth of review, and gives the reader an
   understanding of how to consider its content.

3.3.  Paragraph 1

   The first paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" section contains a
   single sentence, clearly standing out.  The sentence will clearly
   identify the stream-specific status of the document.  The text to be
   used is defined by the stream, with a review for clarity by the IAB
   and RFC Series Editor.

3.4.  Paragraph 2

   The second paragraph of the "Status of This Memo" will include a
   paragraph describing the type of review and exposure the document has
   received.  This is defined on a per-stream basis, subject to general
   review and oversight by the RFC Editor and IAB.  The IAB defines a
   specific structure defined to ensure there is clarity about review
   processes and document types.

RFC 7841           RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates           May 2016


3.5.  Paragraph 3

   The boilerplate ends with a reference to where further relevant
   information can be found.  This information may include, subject to
   the RFC Editor's discretion, information about whether the RFC has
   been updated or obsoleted, the RFC's origin, a listing of possible
   errata, information about how to provide feedback and suggestion, and
   information on how to submit errata as described in [ERRATA].  The
   exact wording and URL is subject to change (at the RFC Editor's
   discretion), but the current text is:

      Information about the current status of this document, any errata,
      and how to provide feedback on it may be obtained at
      http://www.rfc-editor.org/<static-path>/rfc<rfc-no>.

3.6.  Noteworthy

   Note that the text in paragraph 1 and 2 of the boilerplate indicate
   the initial status of a document.  During their lifetime, documents
   can change status to, for example, Historic.  This cannot be
   reflected in the document itself and will need be reflected in the
   information referred to in Section 5.

4.  Additional Notes

   Exceptionally, a review and publication process may prescribe
   additional notes that will appear as labeled notes after the
   "Abstract".

   This is no longer a common feature of recent RFCs.  It is the goal of
   this document to continue to ensure that the overall RFC structure is
   adequately clear so that such notes are unnecessary or (at least)
   truly exceptional.

5.  Other Structural Information in RFCs

   RFCs contain other structural informational elements.  The RFC Editor
   is responsible for the positioning and layout of these structural
   elements.  Note also that new elements may be introduced or obsoleted
   using a process consistent with [RFC4844].  These additions may or
   may not require documentation in an RFC.

   Currently, the following structural information is available in RFCs:

   Copyright Notice:  A copyright notice with a reference to BCP 78
      [BCP78] and an Intellectual Property statement referring to BCP 78
      and BCP 79 [BCP79].  The content of these statements are defined
      by those BCPs.

   ISSN:  The International Standard Serial Number [ISO.3297.2007]:
      ISSN 2070-1721.  The ISSN uniquely identifies the RFC series as
      title regardless of language or country in which it is published.
      The ISSN itself has no significance other than the unique
      identification of a serial publication.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document tries to clarify the descriptions of the status of an
   RFC.  Misunderstanding the status of a memo could cause
   interoperability problems, hence security and stability problems.

7.  RFC Editor Considerations

   The RFC Editor is responsible for maintaining the consistency of the
   RFC series.  To that end, the RFC Editor maintains an "RFC Style
   Guide" [RFC7322].  In this memo, we mention a few explicit structural
   elements that the RFC Editor needs to maintain.  The conventions for
   the content and use of all current and future elements are documented
   in the style guide.

   Adding a reference to the stream in the header of RFCs is only one
   method for clarifying from which stream an RFC originated.  The RFC
   Editor is encouraged to add such indication in, for example, indices
   and interfaces.

Appendix A.  Initial Formatting Details

   This section contains the text the IAB used to initially populate the
   web page used to maintain the list of required verbiage.

A.1.  RFC Title Page Header

   An RFC title page header can be described as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<document source>                                          <author name>
Request for Comments: <RFC number>                [<author affiliation>]
[<subseries ID> <subseries number>]    [more author info as appropriate]
[<RFC relation>:<RFC number[s]>]
Category: <category>
                                                            <month year>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   For example, the header for RFC 6410 appears as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A.2.  Constructing a "Status of This Memo" Section

   The following sections describe mandated text for use in specific
   parts of the "Status of This Memo" portion of an RFC.  For
   convenience, the RFC Editor maintains example expansions of all
   permutations of the paragraphs described in this document (at the
   time of publication, at http://www.rfc-editor.org/materials/status-
   memos.txt).  When in conflict, the following sections are
   authoritative.

RFC 7841           RFC Streams, Headers, Boilerplates           May 2016


A.2.1.  First Paragraph

   The following are the approved texts for use in the first paragraph
   of the "Status of This Memo" portion of an RFC.  See Section 3.3 of
   RFC 7841.

   For 'Standards Track' documents:  "This is an Internet Standards
      Track document."

   For 'Best Current Practices' documents:  "This memo documents an
      Internet Best Current Practice."

   For other categories  "This document is not an Internet Standards
      Track specification; <it is published for other purposes>."

   For Informational, Experimental, Historic, and future categories of
   RFCs, the RFC Editor will maintain an appropriate text for <it is
   published for other purposes>.  Initial values are:

   Informational:   "it is published for informational purposes."

   Historic:   "it is published for the historical record."

   Experimental:   "it is published for examination, experimental
      implementation, and evaluation."

A.2.2.  Second Paragraph

   See Section 3.4 of RFC 7841.

   The second paragraph may include some text that is specific to the
   initial document category.  When a document is Experimental or
   Historic, the second paragraph opens with:

   Experimental:  "This document defines an Experimental Protocol for
      the Internet community."

   Historic:  "This document defines a Historic Document for the
      Internet community."

   The text that follows is stream dependent -- these are initial values
   and may be updated by stream definition document updates and recorded
   by the IAB on the web page.

   IETF Stream:  "This document is a product of the Internet Engineering
      Task Force (IETF)."

      If there has been an IETF consensus call per IETF process, this
      additional text should be added: "It represents the consensus of
      the IETF community.  It has received public review and has been
      approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering
      Group (IESG)."  If there has not been such a consensus call, then
      this simply reads: "It has been approved for publication by the
      Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG)."

   IAB Stream:  "This document is a product of the Internet Architecture
      Board (IAB), and represents information that the IAB has deemed
      valuable to provide for permanent record."

      If the document represents IAB consensus, this additional text
      should be added: "It represents the consensus of the Internet
      Architecture Board (IAB)."

   IRTF Stream:  "This document is a product of the Internet Research
      Task Force (IRTF).  The IRTF publishes the results of Internet-
      related research and development activities.  These results might
      not be suitable for deployment."

      In addition, a sentence indicating the consensus base within the
      IRTF may be added: "This RFC represents the consensus of the
      <insert_name> Research Group of the Internet Research Task Force
      (IRTF)." or alternatively "This RFC represents the individual
      opinion(s) of one or more members of the <insert_name> Research
      Group of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)".

   Independent Submission Stream:  "This is a contribution to the RFC
      Series, independently of any other RFC stream.  The RFC Editor has
      chosen to publish this document at its discretion and makes no
      statement about its value for implementation or deployment."

   For non-IETF stream documents, a reference to Section 2 of this RFC
   is added with the following sentence: "Documents approved for
   publication by the [stream approver -- currently, one of: "IAB",
   "IRSG", or "RFC Editor"] are not a candidate for any level of
   Internet Standard; see Section 2 of RFC 7841."

   For IETF stream documents, a similar reference is added: "Further
   information on (BCPs or Internet Standards) is available in Section 2
   of RFC 7841." for BCP and Standard Track documents; "Not all
   documents approved by the IESG are a candidate for any level of
   Internet Standards; see Section 2 of RFC 7841." for all other
   categories.

A.2.3.  Third Paragraph

   See Section 3.5 of RFC 7841.
