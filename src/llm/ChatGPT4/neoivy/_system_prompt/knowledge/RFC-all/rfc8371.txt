RFC 8371              MN Identifier Types for MIPv6            July 2018


1.  Introduction

   The "Mobile Node Identifier Option for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6)" [RFC4283]
   has proved to be a popular design tool for providing identifiers for
   mobile nodes during authentication procedures with Authentication,
   Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols such as Diameter
   [RFC6733].  To date, only a single type of identifier has been
   specified, namely the Mobile Node (MN) NAI.  Other types of
   identifiers are in common use and are even referenced in RFC 4283.
   In this document, we propose adding some basic identifier types that
   are defined in various telecommunications standards, including types
   for International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [ThreeGPP-IDS],
   Packet - Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (P-TMSI)
   [ThreeGPP-IDS], International Mobile station Equipment Identities
   (IMEI) [ThreeGPP-IDS], and Globally Unique Temporary UE Identity
   (GUTI) [ThreeGPP-IDS].  In addition, we specify the IPv6 address
   itself and IEEE MAC-layer addresses as Mobile Node identifiers.
   Defining identifiers that are tied to the physical elements of the
   device (e.g., the MAC address) help in deployment of Mobile IP
   because, in many cases, such identifiers are the most natural means
   for uniquely identifying the device and will avoid additional lookup
   steps that might be needed if other identifiers were used.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Descriptions of MN Identifier Types

   This section provides descriptions for the various MN identifier
   types.

4.1.  Description of the IPv6 Address Type

   The IPv6 address [RFC4291] is encoded as a 16-octet string containing
   a full IPv6 address that has been assigned to the mobile node.  The
   IPv6 address MUST be a unicast routable IPv6 address.  Multicast
   addresses, link-local addresses, and the unspecified IPv6 address
   MUST NOT be used.  IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) MAY be used as
   long as any security operations making use of the ULA also take into
   account the domain in which the ULA is guaranteed to be unique.

RFC 8371              MN Identifier Types for MIPv6            July 2018


4.2.  Description of the IMSI MN Identifier Type

   The International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [ThreeGPP-IDS] is
   at most 15 decimal digits (i.e., digits from 0 through 9).  The IMSI
   MUST be encoded as a string of octets in network order (i.e., high to
   low for all digits), where each digit occupies 4 bits.  If needed for
   full octet size, the last digit MUST be padded with 0xf.  For
   instance, an example IMSI 123456123456789 would be encoded as
   follows:

      0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9f

4.3.  Description of the EUI-48 Address Type

   The IEEE EUI-48 address [IEEE802-GUIDELINES] is encoded as 6 octets
   containing the IEEE EUI-48 address.

4.4.  Description of the EUI-64 Address Type

   The IEEE EUI-64 address [IEEE802-GUIDELINES] is encoded as 8 octets
   containing the full IEEE EUI-64 address.

4.5.  Description of the DUID Type

   The DUID is the DHCPv6 Unique Identifier [RFC3315].  There are
   various types of DUIDs, which are distinguished by an initial two-
   octet type field.  Clients and servers MUST treat DUIDs as opaque
   values and MUST only compare DUIDs for equality.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any security mechanisms and does not
   have any impact on existing security mechanisms.

   Mobile node identifiers such as those described in this document are
   considered to be private information.  If used in the MN identifier
   extension as defined in [RFC4283], the packet including the MN
   identifier extension MUST be encrypted so that no personal
   information or trackable identifiers are inadvertently disclosed to
   passive observers.  Operators can potentially apply IPsec
   Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) [RFC4303] in transport mode with
   confidentiality and integrity protection for protecting the identity
   and location information in MIPv6 signaling messages.

   Some MN identifiers contain sensitive identifiers that, as used in
   protocols specified by other Standards Development Organizations
   (SDOs), are only used for signaling during initial network entry.  In
   such protocols, subsequent exchanges then rely on a temporary

   identifier allocated during the initial network entry.  Managing the
   association between long-lived and temporary identifiers is outside
   the scope of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The new mobile node identifier types defined in this document have
   been assigned values from the "Mobile Node Identifier Option
   Subtypes" registry.  The following values have been registered.

               +-----------------+------------------------+
               | Identifier Type | Identifier Type Number |
               +-----------------+------------------------+
               | IPv6 Address    | 2                      |
               | IMSI            | 3                      |
               | P-TMSI          | 4                      |
               | EUI-48 address  | 5                      |
               | EUI-64 address  | 6                      |
               | GUTI            | 7                      |
               | DUID            | 8                      |
               | Reserved        | 9-15                   |
               | Unassigned      | 16-255                 |
               +-----------------+------------------------+

                 Table 2: New Mobile Node Identifier Types

   See Section 4 for additional information about the identifier types.
   The registration procedure is Standards Action [RFC8126].  The expert
   must ascertain that the identifier type allows unique identification
   of the mobile device; since all MN identifiers require encryption,
   there is no additional privacy exposure attendant to the use of new
   types.

Appendix A.  RFID Types

   The material in this non-normative appendix was originally composed
   for inclusion in the main body of the specification but was moved
   into an appendix because there was insufficient support for
   allocating Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) types at the time.
   It was observed that RFID-based mobile devices may create privacy
   exposures unless confidentiality is assured for signaling.  A
   specification for eliminating unauthorized RFID tracking based on
   Layer 2 addresses would be helpful.

   Much of the following text is due to contributions from Hakima
   Chaouchi.  For an overview and some initial suggestions about using
   RFID with IPv6 on mobile devices, see [Using-RFID-IPv6].

   In the context of Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, vertical
   domain, efficient inventory, and tracking items are of major
   interest, and RFID technology is the identification technology in the
   hardware design of many such items.

   The "TRACK-IoT" project [TRACK-IoT] [RFID-framework] explored Mobile
   IPv6 as a mobility management protocol for RFID-based mobile devices.

   1.  Passive RFID tags (that have no processing resources) need to be
       handled by the gateway (likely also the RFID reader), which is
       then the endpoint of the mobility protocol.  It is also the point
       where the Change of Address (CoA) will be created based on some
       combination such as the RFID tag and the prefix of that gateway.
       The point here is to offer the possibility to passive RFID items
       to get an IPv6 address and take advantage of the mobility
       framework to follow the mobile device (passive tag on the item).
       One example scenario that has been proposed, which shows the need
       for mobility management of passive RFID items, would be pieces of
       art tagged with passive tags that need to be monitored while
       transported.

   2.  Using active RFID tags (where the processing resource is
       available on the tag), the endpoint of the mobility protocol can
       be hosted directly on the RFID active tag, which is also called
       an identification sensor.  A use case for active RFID tags
       includes traceability of cold food during mobility (transport).
       Also, mobility of cars equipped with active RFID tags that we
       already use for toll payment can be added with mobility
       management.

   One major effort to connect IETF efforts to EPCglobal (RFID
   standardization) led to the Object Name Service (ONS), which is the
   DNS version applied for RFID logical names and page information

   retrieval.  Attempts have been made to connect IPv6 on the address
   space to RFID identifier format.  Other initiatives started working
   on gateways to map tag identifiers with IPv6 addresses and build
   signaling protocols for the application level.  For instance,
   tracking of mobile items equipped with a tag can be triggered
   remotely by a remote correspondent node until a visiting area where a
   mobile item equipped with an RFID tag is located.  An RFID reader
   will be added with an IPv6-to-RFID tag translation.  One option is to
   build a home IPv6 address of that tagged item by using the prefix of
   the home agent combined with the tag RFID identifier of the mobile
   item; as the tag ID is unique, the home IPv6 address of that item
   will be also unique.  Then, the visiting RFID reader will compose the
   IPv6 care of address of the tagged mobile item by combining the
   prefix of the RFID reader with the tag ID of the item.  MIPv6 can
   then normally provide the mobility management of that RFID-tagged
   item.  A different, useful example of tagged items involves items of
   a factory that can be tracked while they are transported, especially
   for real-time localization and tracking of precious items transported
   without GPS.  An automotive car manufacturer can assign IPv6
   addresses corresponding to RFID-tagged cars or mechanical car parts
   and build a tracking data set of the mobility not only of the cars,
   but also of the mechanical pieces.

   The Tag Data Standard promoted by Electronic Product Code (EPC)
   [EPC-Tag-Data] supports several encoding systems or schemes, which
   are commonly used in RFID applications, including the following:

   o  RFID-GID (Global Identifier),

   o  RFID-SGTIN (Serialized Global Trade Item Number),

   o  RFID-SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code),

   o  RFID-SGLN (Serialized Global Location Number),

   o  RFID-GRAI (Global Returnable Asset Identifier),

   o  RFID-DOD (Department of Defense ID), and

   o  RFID-GIAI (Global Individual Asset Identifier).

RFC 8371              MN Identifier Types for MIPv6            July 2018


   For each RFID scheme except GID, there are three representations:

   o  a 64-bit binary representation (for example, SGLN-64), excluding
      GID,

   o  a 96-bit binary representation (SGLN-96), and

   o  a representation as a URI.

   The URI representation for the RFID is actually a URN.  The EPC
   document has the following language:

      All categories of URIs are represented as Uniform Reference Names
      (URNs) as defined by [RFC2141], where the URN Namespace is epc.

   The following list includes the above RFID types.

A.1.  Description of the RFID Types

   The material in this appendix has been either quoted or loosely
   adapted from [EPC-Tag-Data].

   The General Identifier (GID) that is used with RFID is composed of
   three fields: General Manager Number, Object Class, and Serial
   Number.  The General Manager Number identifies an organizational
   entity that is responsible for maintaining the numbers in subsequent
   fields.  GID encodings include a fourth field, the header, to
   guarantee uniqueness in the namespace defined by EPC.

   Some of the RFID types depend on the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)
   code defined in the EAN.UCC General Specifications [EANUCCGS].  A
   GTIN identifies a particular class of object, such as a particular
   kind of product or SKU.

   The EPC encoding scheme for SGTIN permits the direct embedding of
   EAN.UCC System standard GTIN and Serial Number codes on EPC tags.  In
   all cases, the check digit is not encoded.  Two encoding schemes are
   specified, SGTIN-64 (64 bits) and SGTIN-96 (96 bits).

   The Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) is defined by the EAN.UCC
   Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the SSCC is already intended for
   assignment to individual objects and therefore does not require
   additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  Two encoding
   schemes are specified, SSCC-64 (64 bits) and SSCC-96 (96 bits).

   The Global Location Number (GLN) is defined by the EAN.UCC
   Specifications.  A GLN can represent either a discrete, unique
   physical location such as a warehouse slot, or an aggregate physical
   location such as an entire warehouse.  In addition, a GLN can
   represent a logical entity that performs a business function such as
   placing an order.  The Serialized Global Location Number (SGLN)
   includes the Company Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.

   The Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI) is defined by the
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GRAI is already
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix, Asset Type, and Serial Number.

   The Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI) is defined by the
   General EAN.UCC Specifications.  Unlike the GTIN, the GIAI is already
   intended for assignment to individual objects and therefore does not
   require any additional fields to serve as an EPC pure identity.  The
   GRAI includes the Company Prefix and Individual Asset Reference.

   The DoD Construct identifier is defined by the United States
   Department of Defense (DoD).  This tag data construct may be used to
   encode tags for shipping goods to the DoD by a supplier who has
   already been assigned a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.

A.1.1.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-64 Type

   The RFID-SGTIN-64 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGTIN-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value (additional data
   that is used for fast filtering and preselection), Company Prefix
   Index, Item Reference, and Serial Number.  Only a limited number of
   Company Prefixes can be represented in the 64-bit tag.

A.1.2.  Description of the RFID-SGTIN-96 Type

   The RFID-SGTIN-96 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGTIN-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition (an
   indication of where the subsequent Company Prefix and Item Reference
   numbers are divided), Company Prefix Index, Item Reference, and
   Serial Number.

A.1.3.  Description of the RFID-SSCC-64 Type

   The RFID-SSCC-64 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SSCC-64 includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, and Serial Reference.  Only a limited number of Company
   Prefixes can be represented in the 64-bit tag.

A.1.4.  Description of the RFID-SSCC-96 Type

   The RFID-SSCC-96 is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SSCC-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company
   Prefix, and Serial Reference, as well as 24 bits that remain
   unallocated and must be zero.

A.1.5.  Description of the RFID-SGLN-64 Type

   The RFID-SGLN-64 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGLN-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, Location Reference, and Serial Number.

A.1.6.  Description of the RFID-SGLN-96 Type

   The RFID-SGLN-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   SGLN-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company
   Prefix, Location Reference, and Serial Number.

A.1.7.  Description of the RFID-GRAI-64 Type

   The RFID-GRAI-64 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GRAI-64 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, Asset Type, and Serial Number.

A.1.8.  Description of the RFID-GRAI-96 Type

   The RFID-GRAI-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GRAI-96 includes six fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition, Company
   Prefix, Asset Type, and Serial Number.

A.1.9.  Description of the RFID-GIAI-64 Type

   The RFID-GIAI-64 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GIAI-64 includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Company Prefix
   Index, and Individual Asset Reference.

A.1.10.  Description of the RFID-GIAI-96 Type

   The RFID-GIAI-96 type is encoded as specified in [EPC-Tag-Data].  The
   GIAI-96 includes five fields: Header, Filter Value, Partition,
   Company Prefix, and Individual Asset Reference.

A.1.11.  Description of the RFID-DoD-64 Type

   The RFID-DoD-64 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The
   DoD-64 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.

A.1.12.  Description of the RFID-DoD-96 Type

   The RFID-DoD-96 type is encoded as specified in [RFID-DoD-spec].  The
   DoD-96 type includes four fields: Header, Filter Value, Government
   Managed Identifier, and Serial Number.

A.1.13.  Description of the RFID URI Types

   In some cases, it is desirable to encode in URI form a specific
   encoding of an RFID tag.  For example, an application may prefer a
   URI representation for report preparation.  Applications that wish to
   manipulate any additional data fields on tags may need some
   representation other than the pure identity forms.

   For this purpose, the fields as represented in previous sections are
   associated with specified fields in the various URI types.  For
   instance, the URI may have fields such as CompanyPrefix,
