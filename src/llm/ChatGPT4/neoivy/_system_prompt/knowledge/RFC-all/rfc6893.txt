              A Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for
                       the Open IPTV Forum (OIPF)

Abstract

   This document describes a Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for
   the Open IPTV Forum (OIPF) for naming persistent resources defined
   within OIPF specifications.  Example resources include technical
   documents and specifications, eXtensible Markup Language (XML)
   schemas, classification schemes, XML Document Type Definitions
   (DTDs), namespaces, style sheets, media assets, and other types of
   resources produced or managed by the OIPF.

1.  Introduction

   The Open IPTV Forum (OIPF) is a pan-industry initiative with the
   purpose of producing end-to-end specifications for IPTV that will
   take the next generation of IPTV into the mass market.  The Forum,
   which is fully open to participation from the communications,
   entertainment, and other relevant industries, will focus on the
   development of specifications that will help streamline and
   accelerate deployments of IPTV technologies and will maximize the
   benefits of IPTV for consumers, network operators, content providers,
   service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers, and home and
   network infrastructure providers.

   The main objective of the Open IPTV Forum is to produce end-to-end
   specifications for IPTV including:

      o  Architecture and interfaces

      o  Network and terminal functionality

      o  Interactive and personalized services

RFC 6893                        OIPF URN                      March 2013


      o  Technology choices for all major functionalities

      o  A common UNI (User-Network Interface) for the Open Internet and
         Managed Networks

      o  Certification of equipment, including end user devices and
         service provider offerings

   The end-to-end specifications support:

      o  A variety of IPTV and Internet multimedia services

      o  Managed networks and the Open Internet

      o  Integration with communication services

      o  Convergence of IPTV and multimedia services across different
         access technologies

      o  Easy integration of third-party content offerings

      o  Authentication and content protection

      o  Various devices in the home network

   The OIPF is basing its end-to-end IPTV specifications on relevant
   standards produced by other bodies and is collaborating with them to
   encourage convergence where appropriate and address any shortcomings
   or gaps.

   In the creation of the end-to-end IPTV specification, some new
   resources need to be defined.

   The OIPF would like to assign unique, permanent, location-independent
   names based on URNs for some resources it produces or manages.  These
   URNs will be constructed according to the URN syntax defined in
   [RFC2141].

   This namespace specification is for a formal namespace to be
   registered according to the procedures set forth in [RFC3406].

2.  URN Specification for the OIPF Namespace Identifier (NID)

   This section provides the information required to register a formal
   namespace according to the registration procedure defined in
   [RFC3406].  The URNs conform to the syntax defined in [RFC2141].

      Phone:         +33 492 94 43 83

      Email:         contact@oipf.tv

   Declaration of structure:

      URNs assigned by the OIPF will have the following structure based
      on the organizational structure of the resources specified in the
      OIPF IPTV Solution specifications:

         urn:oipf:<NSS>

      where the syntax of "<NSS>" is specified in Section 2.2 of the URN
      Syntax requirements ([RFC2141]).

      The individual URNs will be assigned by the OIPF through the
      process of development of OIPF specifications.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      None.

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The OIPF will establish unique identifiers as appropriate and will
      ensure that an assigned string is never reassigned.

RFC 6893                        OIPF URN                      March 2013


   Identifier persistence considerations:

      The OIPF is committed to maintaining the accessibility and
      persistence of all resources that are officially assigned URNs by
      the organization.  The registration tables and information will be
      published and maintained by the OIPF on its website.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      The assignment of identifiers is fully controlled and managed by
      the OIPF.

   Process of identifier resolution:

      Not applicable; the "oipf" namespace is not listed with a
      Resolution Discovery System.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The "<NSS>" is case-insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be managed completely and
      published by the OIPF.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples of schemas and classification schemes are
   taken from the current OIPF Release 1 IPTV Solution specification:

      urn:oipf:device:ig:1

      urn:oipf:config:oitf:oitfCapabilities:2009

      urn:oipf:iptv:IPTVProfile:2008

      urn:oipf:cs:AVMediaFormatCS:2008

      urn:oipf:cs:ApplicationTypeCS:2009

4.  Namespace Considerations

   A unique formal namespace is required by the OIPF in order to specify
   how the various existing standards can be linked in order to create a
   true end-to-end ecosystem for standards-based IPTV deployments and to
   provide the necessary system-wide resources.

   URN assignment procedures:

      The individual URNs shall be assigned through the process of
      development of OIPF specifications by the Open IPTV Forum (OIPF)
      e.V.  The latest information about OIPF-defined specifications can
      always be found at the owner's website at

         <http://www.oipf.tv/specifications>

   URN resolution/delegation:

      The resolution and delegation shall be determined through the
      process of development of specifications by the Open IPTV Forum.

      Since the implementations envisaged cover a wide range of devices
      with quite different access methods and capabilities, no single
      resolution or delegation mechanism can be referenced in this
      document.

   Types of resources to be identified:

      Types of resources to be identified include XML schema definition
      files, classification schemes, and identification systems defined
      and published by the OIPF.  These resources being identified
      constitute a metadata system to describe digital multimedia
      broadcast services or content conveyed as part of such services.

      The latest OIPF-defined specifications can always be found at

         <http://www.oipf.tv/specifications>

5.  Community Considerations

   URNs defined by the OIPF will be used by implementers of IPTV
   systems, services, products, and applications based on the OIPF IPTV
   Solution specification.  They are an essential component of the open
   IPTV ecosystem that is being facilitated by the OIPF.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in [RFC1737], [RFC2141], and [RFC3406].

   This document registers a namespace for URNs.  OIPF may assign
   special meaning to certain characters of the Namespace Specific
   String (NSS) in its specifications.  Any security considerations
   resulting from such an assignment is outside the scope of this
   document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a URN NID registration of "oipf".  IANA has
   included it in the "Uniform Resource Names (URN) Namespaces" registry
   with a value of 47.
