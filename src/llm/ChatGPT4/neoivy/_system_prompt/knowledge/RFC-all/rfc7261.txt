1.  Introduction

   [RFC4856] describes the annexa parameter for G723 as follows:

      annexa: indicates that Annex A, voice activity detection, is used
      or preferred.  Permissible values are "yes" and "no" (without the
      quotes); "yes" is implied if this parameter is omitted.

   Also, [RFC4856] describes the annexb parameter for G729, G729D, and
   G729E as follows:

      annexb: indicates that Annex B, voice activity detection, is used
      or preferred.  Permissible values are "yes" and "no" (without the
      quotes); "yes" is implied if this parameter is omitted.

   However, a problem arises when the value of the annexa or annexb
   parameter does not match in the SDP [RFC4566] offer and answer.

   For example, if the offer has G729 with annexb=yes and the answer has
   G729 with annexb=no, it can be interpreted in two different ways:

   o  The offerer and answerer proceed as if G729 is negotiated with
      annexb=yes, or

   o  The offerer and answerer proceed as if G729 is negotiated with
      annexb=no.

RFC 7261        Offer/Answer G723 AnnexA and G729 AnnexB        May 2014


   Since this is not clear in the existing specifications, various
   implementations have interpreted the offer/answer in their own ways,
   resulting in a different codec being chosen to call failure, when the
   parameter value does not match in the offer and answer.

   [RFC3264] requires SDP extensions that define new fmtp parameters to
   specify their proper interpretation in offer/answer.  This document
   specifies the proper interpretation for the annexa and annexb
   parameters in offer/answer.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Offer/Answer Considerations

   The general objective of the offer/answer considerations is to make
   sure that if the offerer or answerer indicates it does not support
   Annex A or Annex B, then Annex A or Annex B is not used.

3.1.  Considerations for Use of Comfort Noise Frames

   [RFC3551] states that:

      Receivers MUST accept comfort noise frames if restriction of their
      use has not been signaled.  The MIME registration for G729 in RFC
      3555 specifies a parameter that MAY be used with MIME or SDP to
      restrict the use of comfort noise frames.

   Hence, if the SDP offer or answer indicates that comfort noise is not
   supported, comfort noise frames MUST NOT be used.

3.2.  Offer/Answer Considerations for G723 Annex A

   When the offer or answer has G723 and the annexa parameter is absent,
   the offerer or answerer knows that it has implied the default
   "annexa=yes".  This is because the annexa attribute is part of the
   original registration of audio/G723 [RFC4856].  All implementations
   that support G723 understand the annexa attribute.  Hence, this case
   MUST be considered as if the offer or answer has G723 with
   annexa=yes.

   When the offer has G723 with annexa=yes and the answer has G723 with
   annexa=no, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if G723 is
   negotiated with annexa=no.

RFC 7261        Offer/Answer G723 AnnexA and G729 AnnexB        May 2014


   When the offer has G723 with annexa=no, after the offer/answer
   completion the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if G723 is
   negotiated with annexa=no.

      When the offer has G723 with annexa=no, the reason for not
      mandating that the answer MUST have annexa=no for G723 is that
      there are implementations that omit the annexa parameter in
      answer.  In such cases, the offerer and answerer proceed as if
      G723 is negotiated with annexa=no.

   When the offer has G723 with no annexa parameter and the answer has
   G723 with annexa=yes, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if
   G723 is negotiated with annexa=yes.

3.3.  Offer/Answer Considerations for G729 Annex B, G729D Annex B, and
      G729E Annex B

   In this section, G729 represents any of G729 or G729D or G729E.

   When the offer or answer has G729 and the annexb parameter is absent,
   the offerer or answerer knows that it has implied the default
   "annexb=yes".  This is because the annexb attribute is part of the
   original registration of audio/G729 [RFC4856].  All implementations
   that support G729 understand the annexb attribute.  Hence, this case
   MUST be considered as if the offer or answer has G729 with
   annexb=yes.

   When the offer has G729 with annexb=yes and the answer has G729 with
   annexb=no, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if G729 is
   negotiated with annexb=no.

   When the offer has G729 with annexb=no, after the offer/answer
   completion the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if G729 is
   negotiated with annexb=no.

      When the offer has G729 with annexb=no, the reason for not
      mandating that the answer MUST have annexb=no for G729 is that
      there are implementations that omit the annexb parameter in the
      answer.  In such cases, the offerer and answerer proceed as if
      G729 is negotiated with annexb=no.

   When the offer has G729 with no annexb parameter and the answer has
   G729 with annexb=yes, the offerer and answerer MUST proceed as if
   G729 is negotiated with annexb=yes.

5.  Security Considerations

   The guidelines described in [RFC6562] are to be followed for Use of
   Voice Activity Detection (i.e., Annex A or Annex B) with the Secure
   Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP).
