1.  Introduction

   This memo defines an extension to the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it defines objects for the management of
   Parallel-printer-like devices.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o    RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
           describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      o    STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
           objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

RFC 1660               Parallel-printer-like MIB               July 1994


      o    RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
           architectural aspects of the framework.

      o    RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
           access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object object type is named
   by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to
   refer to the object type.

3.  Overview

   The Parallel-printer-like Hardware Device MIB applies to interface
   ports that would most probably support the Character MIB.  The most
   common example is Centronics-like printer port.

   The Parallel-printer-like Hardware Device MIB is mandatory for all
   systems that have such a hardware port supporting services managed
   through some other MIB.

   The Parallel-printer-like Hardware Port MIB includes Centronics-like
   and Data-Products-like parallel physical links with a similar set of
   control signals.

   The MIB contains objects that relate to physical layer connections.

   The MIB comprises one base object and three tables, detailed in the
   following sections.  The tables contain objects for ports and input
   and output control signals.

3.1.  Relationship to Interface MIB

   The Parallel-printer-like MIB is one of many MIBs designed for
   layered use as described in the Interface MIB [5].  In most
   implementations where it is present, it will be in the lowest
   interface sublayer, that is, the Parallel-printer-like MIB represents
   the physical layer, providing service to higher layers such as the



Stewart                                                         [Page 2]

RFC 1660               Parallel-printer-like MIB               July 1994


   Character MIB [6].

   Although it is unlikely that a parallel printer port will actually be
   used as a network interface, which is the intent of the Interface
   MIB, the Parallel-printer-like MIB is closely connected to the
   Character MIB, which can share hardware interfaces with network
   operation, and relate to the RS-232 MIB [7].

   The Interface MIB's ifTestTable and ifRcvAddressTable are not
   relevant to the Parallel-printer-like MIB.

   The Parallel-printer-like MIB is relevant for ifType values para(34)
   and perhaps others.

   The Parallel-printer-like MIB requires the conformance groups
   ifGeneralGroup, and ifFixedLengthGroup.

   Usefulness of error counters in this MIB depends on the octet
   counters in ifFixedLengthGroup.
