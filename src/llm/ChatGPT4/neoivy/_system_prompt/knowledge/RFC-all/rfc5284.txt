                      User-Defined Errors for RSVP

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) defines an ERROR_SPEC object
   for communicating errors.  That object has a defined format that
   permits the definition of 256 error codes.  As RSVP has been
   developed and extended, the convention has been to be conservative in
   defining new error codes.  Further, no provision for user-defined
   errors exists in RSVP.

   This document defines a USER_ERROR_SPEC to be used in addition to the
   ERROR_SPEC to carry additional user information related to errors.

1.  Introduction

   The Resource ReserVation Protocol (RSVP) [RFC2205] defines an
   ERROR_SPEC object for communicating errors.  That object has a
   defined format that permits the definition of 256 error codes.  As
   RSVP has been developed and extended, the convention has been to be
   conservative in communicating errors.  Further, no provision for user
   defined errors exists in RSVP.

   When developing extensions to RSVP, it is often useful for those
   implementing to define error messages to aid both in the initial
   debugging and in testing against older versions or other
   implementations.

   This document defines a new RSVP object to permit user-defined errors
   to be communicated.  This will enable organizations to define errors
   that they can use for internal development.  These error values could
   also be shared with the community at large to aid in promoting
   interoperability between diverse implementations.

RFC 5284              User-Defined Errors for RSVP           August 2008


   RSVP PathErr and ResvErr messages require the presence of an
   ERROR_SPEC object ([RFC2205]).  [RFC3473] defines the Notify message
   that also requires the presence of an ERROR_SPEC object.  In order to
   not change the mandatory contents of these messages, this document
   defines a new error code value that indicates that the new object is
   present and carries a user-defined error code.

   Note that the ResvConf message defined in [RFC2205] also carries an
   ERROR_SPEC object.  But this usage of the object does not carry
   meaningful Error Codes or Error Values and so the extensions defined
   in this document are not applicable to that message.

1.1.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  User-Defined Error

   A new Error Code is defined for use in an ERROR_SPEC object.

      Error Code = 33: User Error Spec

      This error code is used to signal the presence of a
      USER_ERROR_SPEC.  One Error Value is defined as follows.

        Error Value 0 = Further details in User Error Spec

        Further error values may be defined in future specifications.

   When sending this error code, a USER_ERROR_SPEC object MUST be
   included in the PathErr, ResvErr, or Notify message.

3.  USER_ERROR_SPEC Class

   A new RSVP object class called USER_ERROR_SPEC is defined.  To
   support backwards compatibility, its class number is in the range
   192-247.  As defined in [RFC2205], implementations that do not
   understand such an object will forward it unmodified.

   USER_ERROR_SPEC object: Class = 194, C-Type = 1

      Enterprise Number

         A unique identifier of an organization encoded as a 32-bit
         integer.  Enterprise Numbers (sometimes known as Private
         Enterprise Numbers) are assigned by IANA and managed on a first
         come first served basis through the IANA registry named
         "Enterprise Numbers" [RFC2578].

      Sub Org

         A unique identifier of an organization encoded as an 8-bit
         integer.  An organization MAY use this field to create
         independent Error Value spaces.  This is intended to facilitate
         teams that are doing parallel development.  If independent
         spaces are not required, this field SHOULD be set to zero.

      Err Desc Len

         The length of the error description in the Error Description
         field in bytes excluding any padding.  Zero is a valid length
         if no error description is supplied.

      User Error Value

         A 16-bit integer.  The meaning is specified by the
         (sub-)organization indicated by the Enterprise Number and Sub
         Org fields.

RFC 5284              User-Defined Errors for RSVP           August 2008


      Error Description

         A string of characters padded with nulls (0x00) to a multiple
         of 4 bytes.  According to the guidance in [RFC2277], this
         string MUST use UTF-8/Net-Unicode encoding [RFC5198].
         Furthermore, it is RECOMMENDED that implementations limit the
         strings that they generate to single-line printable US-ASCII
         [ASCII] whenever feasible to improve the likelihood of easy use
         by the recipient.

         If the Err Desc Len is zero, then no bytes are supplied.

         Note that the content of this field is implementation-specific.
         It is typically printable, but might not be shown to all users
         in all implementations (because of character set choice).
         Therefore, the content of the field SHOULD be limited to
         supplementary information and SHOULD NOT contain information
         critical to operating the network.  Critical information is
         present in the User Error Value field.

      User-Defined Subobjects

         User-defined subobjects MAY be included.  The generic format of
         subobjects is specified in Section 3.1.  The semantics of a
         subobject is indicated by the Type field, but the semantics,
         format, and contents of the Value field are specified by the
         (sub-)organization indicated by the Enterprise Number and Sub
         Org fields of this object.

3.1.  Subobjects

   Each subobject is encoded as a TLV in the following format:

       0                   1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-------------//----------------+
      |     Type      |     Length    | (Subobject contents)          |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-------------//----------------+

      Type

         An 8-bit number assigned by the (sub-)organization indicated by
         the Enterprise Number and Sub Org fields of the USER_ERROR_SPEC
         object.

RFC 5284              User-Defined Errors for RSVP           August 2008


      Length

         The Length contains the total length of the subobject in bytes,
         including the Type and Length fields.  The Length MUST be at
         least 4, and MUST be a multiple of 4.

4.  Procedures for Using the User Error Spec

4.1.  Procedures for Sending the User Error Spec

   A USER_ERROR_SPEC object MAY be included in any PathErr, ResvErr, or
   Notify message for any defined error code.  The Enterprise Number
   MUST be a valid value assigned by IANA from the "Enterprise Numbers"
   registry.

   As specified in [RFC2205] and [RFC3473], an ERROR_SPEC object with a
   valid error code MUST be included in all PathErr, ResvErr, and Notify
   messages.  This rule is not changed by these procedures even when a
   USER_ERROR_SPEC object is included.  If no other error code applies,
   the Error Code in the ERROR_SPEC object MUST be set to "User Error
   Spec" as defined in Section 2 of this document.  When the Error Code
   in the ERROR_SPEC object is set to "User Error Spec", the Error Value
   sub-code SHOULD be set to "Further details in User Error Spec" as
   defined in Section 2, but further Error Value sub-codes may be
   defined in future specifications.

4.2.  Procedures for Receiving the User Error Spec

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementations that receive a PathErr,
   ResvErr, or Notify message carrying a USER_ERROR_SPEC object log (at
   a minimum) the Enterprise Number, Sub-organization, User Error Value,
   and Error Description.  Note that the character set used for the
   Error Description may mean that it might not be suitable for display
   of logging in all systems.  Implementations capable of interpreting
   the contents of the USER_ERROR_SPEC object SHOULD take further action
   based on the reported error.

   Implementations that are not UTF-8 capable and that receive a
   USER_ERROR_SPEC object SHOULD handle the Error Description according
   to the procedures set out in [RFC5137].

   If a message is received containing an ERROR_SPEC object using the
   "User Error Spec" error code, but not containing a USER_ERROR_SPEC
   object, the message MUST be treated as malformed and handled
   according to [RFC2205].

RFC 5284              User-Defined Errors for RSVP           August 2008


   Implementations SHOULD ignore repeated occurrences of USER_ERROR_SPEC
   objects, and SHOULD forward them unchanged on any messages that they
   forward.  This provides for forward compatibility.

   Implementations receiving a USER_ERROR_SPEC object on some message
   other than a PathErr, ResvErr, or Notify message MUST treat the error
   as a malformed message and process according to [RFC2205].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  RSVP Error Codes

   This document makes the following assignments from the RSVP Error
   Codes and Globally-Defined Error Value Sub-Codes registry:

        Error Code      Meaning

           33           User Error Spec

   One Error Value sub-code is defined for use with this Error Code as
   follows:

         0 = Further details in User Error Spec

5.2.  RSVP Objects

   This document makes the following assignments from the RSVP Class
   Names, Class Numbers, and Class Types registry:

       Number Space     Value       Name

       Class Numbers     194        USER_ERROR_SPEC

       Class Type         1         User-Defined Error

6.  Security Considerations

   This document makes no changes to the basic message exchanges of
   [RFC2205] and [RFC3473].  It will result in a small increase in the
   number of error messages sent in cases where messages were previously
   silently dropped due to the lack of an appropriate error code.

   The mechanisms defined in this document may be used by
   implementations to report additional error conditions and information
   arising from security issues and attacks on the RSVP network.

RFC 5284              User-Defined Errors for RSVP           August 2008


   Note that the use of a character string that will be displayed or
   logged opens the potential for certain security attacks through the
   use of overruns or embedded control characters.  Implementations
   SHOULD take precautions against overruns, and (especially where the
   full character set of [RFC5198] is not supported, SHOULD use the
   procedures set out in [RFC5137] to handle unexpected or unknown
   control characters.
