1.  Introduction

   The Sieve [RFC5228] Vacation extension [RFC5230] defines a mechanism
   to generate automatic replies to incoming email messages.  Through
   the ":days" parameter, it limits the number of auto-replies to the
   same sender to one per [n] days, for a specified number of days.  But
   there are cases when one needs more granularity, if one would like to
   generate "vacation" replies more frequently.

   This extension defines a ":seconds" parameter to provide more
   granularity for such situations.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The upper-case key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The ':seconds' Parameter

   The purpose of the ":seconds" parameter is to specify the minimum
   time interval (in seconds) between consecutive auto-replies to a
   given sender.  The ":seconds" value, if specified, is used instead of
   the ":days" value, and works in a similar way (see the Vacation
   extension [RFC5230] for details).  Only one of ":days" or ":seconds"
   is allowed -- use of both parameters in the same vacation action MUST
   result in a Sieve processing error.

   The capability string associated with this extension is "vacation-
   seconds".  Note that "vacation-seconds" implies "vacation", and a
   script with "vacation-seconds" in a "require" list can omit
   "vacation" from that list.

RFC 6131            Sieve Vacation: Seconds Parameter          July 2011


   The time value is specified in seconds, and MUST be greater than or
   equal to 0 and less than 2**31.  All valid values, from 0 to 2**31,
   MUST be accepted without error.  Sites MAY define a minimum effective
   value and/or a maximum effective value.  If a site chooses to do
   that:

   1.  Call the value specified "v(spec)".

   2.  Call the minimum effective value "v(min)".

   3.  Call the maximum effective value "v(max)".

   4.  Call the actual effective value used by the processor "v(eff)".

   5.  The following apply for determining v(eff):

       *  If 0 <= v(spec) < v(min), then v(eff) = v(min).

       *  If v(min) <= v(spec) <= v(max), then v(eff) = v(spec).

       *  If v(max) < v(spec) <= 2**31, then v(eff) = v(max).

   If a site imposes a maximum effective value, that value MUST be at
   least 86400 (one day).

   If ":seconds 0" is specified and used, it means that all auto-replies
   are sent, and no attempt is made to suppress consecutive replies.
   This differs from the base vacation specification, which does not
   allow a time period of zero (":days 0" is forbidden); the change is
   necessary to allow operation of an auto-responder (see [RFC6133], and
   note especially example 4 in section 3 of that document).

   If ":seconds" and ":days" are both omitted, a site-defined interval
   is used (see [RFC5230]).

   Usage: vacation [":days" number | ":seconds" number]
                   [":subject" string]
                   [":from" string]
                   [":addresses" string-list]
                   [":mime"]
                   [":handle" string]
                   <reason: string>

3.  Examples

   The following example will automatically reply to senders with a
   message that the recipient is in a meeting.  Multiple replies to the
   same sender will only be sent every half hour (1800 seconds).

   require ["vacation-seconds"];
   vacation :addresses ["tjs@example.edu", "ts4z@landru.example.edu"]
            :seconds 1800
            "I am in a meeting, and do not have access to email.";

   The following example is used to send an acknowledgment to every
   message received.  A :seconds value of zero is used to reply to every
   message, with no removal of duplicates to the same sender.  This
   requires that the Sieve engine allow an interval of zero; if it does
   not, and it imposes a minimum value, not every message will receive
   an auto-reply.

   require ["vacation-seconds"];

   vacation :handle "auto-resp" :seconds 0
       "Your request has been received.  A service
        representative will contact you as soon as
        possible, usually within one business day.";

4.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations for the Sieve Vacation extension [RFC5230]
   apply equally here.  In addition, implementations SHOULD consider the
   number of auto-replies that might be generated by allowing small
   values of ":seconds" (including 0), and MAY impose additional limits
   on that number.  See the Security Considerations section of RFC 3834
   [RFC3834] for a fuller discussion.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of Sieve Extension

   To:  iana@iana.org
   Subject:  Registration of new Sieve extension
   Capability name:  vacation-seconds
   Description:  adds the ":seconds" parameter to the Sieve Vacation
      extension.  Implementations that support this MUST also support
      "vacation".
   RFC number:  RFC 6131
   Contact address:  The Sieve discussion list <sieve@ietf.org>
