1.  Introduction

   This document introduces a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the Routing
   Information Protocol (RIP) [RFC2453][RFC2080].  RIP was designed to
   work as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) in moderate-size
   Autonomous Systems (AS).

   This YANG data model supports both RIP version 2 and RIPng.  RIP
   version 2 (defined in [RFC2453]) supports IPv4.  RIPng (defined in
   [RFC2080]) supports IPv6.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is
   defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

2.  Design of the Data Model

2.1.  Scope of the Data Model

   The data model covers RIP version 2 [RFC2453] and RIPng [RFC2080]
   protocols.  The model is designed to be implemented on a device where
   RIP version 2 or RIPng is implemented, and can be used to:

   *  Configure the RIP version 2 or RIPng protocol.

   *  Manage the protocol operational behaviors.

   *  Retrieve the protocol operational status.

   The capabilities described in [RFC1724] are covered.

2.2.  Relation to the Core Routing Framework

   This data model augments the core routing data model "ietf-routing"
   specified in [RFC8349].

     +--rw routing
        +--rw router-id?
        +--rw control-plane-protocols
        |  +--rw control-plane-protocol* [type name]
        |     +--rw type
        |     +--rw name
        |     +--rw rip     <= Augmented by this Model
                    ...

   The "rip" container instantiates a RIP entity that supports RIP
   version 2 or RIPng.  Depending on the implementation of "ietf-
   routing", a RIP instance MAY belong to a logical router or network
   instance.

2.3.  Protocol Configuration

   The data model structure for the protocol configuration is as shown
   below:

     augment /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/
     rt:control-plane-protocol:
       +--rw rip
          +--rw <per instance configuration>
          +--rw interface* [interface]
             +--rw interface                  if:interface-ref
             +--rw <per interface configuration>
             +--rw neighbors {explicit-neighbors}?
             |  +--rw neighbor* [address]
             |     +--rw address    inet:ip-address
             |     +--rw <per neighbor configuration>

   The data model allows the configuration of the following protocol
   entities:

   *  Protocol instance (RIP version 2 or RIPng)

   *  Interface

   *  Neighbor

2.4.  Protocol States

   The data model structure for the protocol states is as shown below:

     augment /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/
     rt:control-plane-protocol:
       +--rw rip
          +--ro <per instance operational states>
          +--rw interface* [interface]
          |  +--rw interface                  if:interface-ref
          |  +--ro <per instance operational states>
          |  +--ro statistics {interface-statistics}?
          |     +--ro <per instance statistics>
          +--ro ipv4
          |  +--ro neighbors
          |  |  +--ro neighbor* [ipv4-address]
          |  |     +--ro <per neighbor IPv4 operational states>
          |  +--ro routes
          |     +--ro route* [ipv4-prefix]
          |        +--ro <IPv4 RIP route states>
          +--ro ipv6
          |  +--ro neighbors
          |  |  +--ro neighbor* [ipv6-address]
          |  |     +--ro <per neighbor IPv6 operational states>
          |  +--ro routes
          |     +--ro route* [ipv6-prefix]
          |        +--ro ipv6-prefix                    inet:ipv6-prefix
          |        +--ro <IPv4 RIP route states>
          +--ro statistics {global-statistics}?
             +--ro <per instance statistics>

   This model conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture
   (NMDA) [RFC8342].  The operational state data is combined with the
   associated configuration data in the same hierarchy [RFC8407].  When
   protocol states are retrieved from the NMDA operational state
   datastore, the returned states cover all "config true" (rw) and
   "config false" (ro) nodes defined in the schema.

   The model allows the retrieval of protocol states at the following
   levels:

   *  Protocol instance (RIP version 2 or RIPng)

   *  Interface

   *  Neighbor

   *  Route

2.5.  RPC Operations

   This model defines one RPC "clear-rip-route" that can be used to
   clear RIP routes from the routing table.

2.6.  Notifications

   This model does not define RIP-specific notifications.  To enable
   notifications, the mechanisms defined in [RFC8639] and [RFC8641] can
   be used.  This mechanism currently allows the user to do the
   following:

   *  Subscribe to notifications on a per-client basis.

   *  Specify subtree filters or XML Path Language (XPath) filters so
      that only interested contents will be sent.

   *  Specify either periodic or on-demand notifications.

2.7.  Optional Features

   This model defines several features that are beyond the basic RIP
   configuration, and it is the responsibility of each vendor to decide
   whether to support a given feature on a device.

3.  Tree Structure

   This document defines the YANG module "ietf-rip", which has the
   following tree structure:

   module: ietf-rip

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-rip
   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG modules in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020]:

   Name:  ietf-rip
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-rip
   Prefix:  rip
   Reference:  RFC 8695

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides the means
   to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol/
      rip:rip

   Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can adversely
   affect the routing subsystem of both the local device and the
   network.  This may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of packets
   to inappropriate destinations, and other problems.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols/rt:control-plane-protocol/
      rip:rip

   Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can disclose
   the operational state information of RIP on this device.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   RPC clear-rip-route:

   Unauthorized access to the RPC above can adversely affect the routing
   subsystem of both the local device and the network.  This may lead to
   network malfunctions, delivery of packets to inappropriate
   destinations, and other problems.
