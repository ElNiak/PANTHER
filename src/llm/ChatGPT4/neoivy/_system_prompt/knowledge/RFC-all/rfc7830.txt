1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] was specified to transport DNS
   messages in cleartext form.  Since this can expose significant
   amounts of information about the Internet activities of an end user,
   the IETF has undertaken work to provide confidentiality to DNS
   transactions (see the DPRIVE working group).  Encrypting the DNS
   transport is considered one of the options to improve the situation.

   However, even if both DNS query and response messages were encrypted,
   metadata could still be used to correlate such messages with well-
   known unencrypted messages, hence jeopardizing some of the
   confidentiality gained by encryption.  One such property is the
   message size.

   This document specifies the Extensions Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))
   "Padding" option, which allows DNS clients and servers to
   artificially increase the size of a DNS message by a variable number
   of bytes, hampering size-based correlation of the encrypted message.

2.  Terminology

   The terms "Requestor" and "Responder" are to be interpreted as
   specified in [RFC6891].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  The "Padding" Option

   The EDNS(0) [RFC6891] specifies a mechanism to include new options in
   DNS packets, contained in the RDATA of the OPT meta-RR.  This
   document specifies the "Padding" option in order to allow clients and
   servers to pad DNS packets by a variable number of bytes.  The
   "Padding" option MUST occur at most, once per OPT meta-RR (and hence,
   at most once per message).

   The figure below specifies the structure of the option in the RDATA
   of the OPT RR:

                0                       8                      16
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |                  OPTION-CODE                  |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |                 OPTION-LENGTH                 |
                +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
                |        (PADDING) ...        (PADDING) ...     /
                +-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -

                                 Figure 1

   The OPTION-CODE for the "Padding" option is 12.

   The OPTION-LENGTH for the "Padding" option is the size (in octets) of
   the PADDING.  The minimum number of PADDING octets is 0.

   The PADDING octets SHOULD be set to 0x00.  Other values MAY be used,
   for example, in cases where there is a concern that the padded
   message could be subject to compression before encryption.  PADDING
   octets of any value MUST be accepted in the messages received.

4.  Usage Considerations

   This document does not specify the actual amount of padding to be
   used, since this depends on the situation in which the option is
   used.  However, padded DNS messages MUST NOT exceed the number of
   octets specified in the Requestor's Payload Size field encoded in the
   RR Class Field (see Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 of [RFC6891]).

   Responders MUST pad DNS responses when the respective DNS query
   included the "Padding" option, unless doing so would violate the
   maximum UDP payload size.

   Responders MAY pad DNS responses when the respective DNS query
   indicated EDNS(0) support of the Requestor and the "Padding" option
   was not included.

RFC 7830                     EDNS(0) Padding                    May 2016


   Responders MUST NOT pad DNS responses when the respective DNS query
   did not indicate EDNS(0) support.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned Option Code 12 for "Padding" in the "DNS EDNS0
   Option Codes (OPT)" registry.

   IANA has updated the respective registration record by changing the
   Reference field to RFC 7830 and the Status field to "Standard".

6.  Security Considerations

   Padding DNS packets obviously increases their size, and will
   therefore lead to increased traffic.

   The use of the EDNS(0) padding only provides a benefit when DNS
   packets are not transported in cleartext.  Further, it is possible
   that EDNS(0) padding may make DNS amplification attacks easier.
   Therefore, implementations MUST NOT use this option if the DNS
   transport is not encrypted.

   Padding length might be affected by lower-level compression.
   Therefore (as described in Section 3.3 of [RFC7525]), implementations
   and deployments SHOULD disable compression at the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) level.

   The payload of the "Padding" option could (like many other fields in
   the DNS protocol) be used as a covert channel.
