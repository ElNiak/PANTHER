RFC 5188               EVRC-WB RTP Payload Format          February 2008


1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the payload formats for packetization of
   EVRC-WB encoded speech signals into the Real-time Transport Protocol
   (RTP).  It defines support for the header-free, interleaved/bundled,
   and compact bundle packet formats for the EVRC-WB codec as well as
   discontinuous transmission (DTX) support for EVRC-WB encoded speech
   transported via RTP.  The EVRC-WB codec offers better speech quality
   than the EVRC and EVRC-B codecs.  EVRC-WB belongs to the EVRC family
   of codecs.  This document also updates the media type registrations
   for the EVRC-B codec.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

3.  Background

   EVRC-WB is a wideband extension of the EVRC-B [4] speech codec
   developed in the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) with
   support for discontinuous transmission (DTX).  It provides enhanced
   (wideband) voice quality.

   The EVRC-WB codec operates on 20-ms frames, and the default sampling
   rate is 16 kHz.  Input and output at an 8-kHz sampling rate are also
   supported.  The EVRC-WB codec can operate in three modes (0, 4, and
   7) defined in [5].  EVRC-WB modes 4 and 7 are interoperable with
   EVRC-B.  EVRC-WB mode 4 uses full-rate, 1/2-rate, and 1/8-rate
   frames.  EVRC-WB mode 7 uses only 1/2 rate and 1/8 rate frames.  Mode
   change results in codec output bit-rate change but do not cause any
   decoding problems at the receiver.  For successful decoding, the
   decoder does not need to know the encoder's current mode of
   operation.  EVRC-WB provides a standardized solution for packetized
   voice applications that allow transitions between narrowband and
   wideband telephony.  The most important service addressed is IP
   telephony.  Target devices can be IP phones or Voice over IP (VoIP)
   handsets, media gateways, voice messaging servers, etc.

4.  EVRC-WB Codec

   The EVRC-WB codec operates on 20-ms frames.  It produces output
   frames of one of the three different sizes: 171 bits, 80 bits, or 16
   bits.  In addition, there are two zero-bit codec frame types: blank
   (null) frames and erasure frames.  The default sampling rate is 16
   kHz.  Input and output at an 8-kHz sampling rate are also supported.

RFC 5188               EVRC-WB RTP Payload Format          February 2008


   The frame type values and sizes of the associated codec data frames
   are listed in the table below:

    Value   Rate      Total codec data frame size in bytes (and in bits)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
        0     Blank      0     (0 bit)
        1     1/8        2    (16 bits)
        2     1/4        5    (40 bits)
        3     1/2       10    (80 bits)
        4     1         22    (171 bits; 5 bits padded at the end)
        5     Erasure    0    (SHOULD NOT be transmitted by sender)

5.  RTP Header Usage

   The format of the RTP header is specified in RFC 3550 [6].  The
   EVRC-WB payload formats (Section 6) use the fields of the RTP header
   in a manner consistent with RFC 3550 [6].

   EVRC-WB also has the capability to operate with 8-kHz sampled input/
   output signals.  The decoder does not require a priori knowledge
   about the sampling rate of the original signal at the input of the
   encoder.  The decoder output can be at 8 kHz or 16 kHz regardless of
   the sampling rate used at the encoder.  Therefore, depending on the
   implementation and the electro acoustic audio capabilities of the
   devices, the input of the encoder and/or the output of the decoder
   can be configured at 8 kHz; however, a 16-kHz RTP clock rate MUST
   always be used.  The RTP timestamp is increased by 320 for each 20
   milliseconds.

   The RTP header marker bit (M) SHALL be set to 1 if the first frame
   carried in the packet contains a speech frame that is the first in a
   talkspurt.  For all other packets, the marker bit SHALL be set to
   zero (M=0).

6.  Payload Format

   Three RTP packet formats are supported for the EVRC-WB codec -- the
   interleaved/bundled packet format, the header-free packet format, and
   the compact bundled packet format.  For all these formats, the
   operational details and capabilities, such as Table of Contents
   (ToC), interleaving, DTX, and bundling, of EVRC-WB are exactly the
   same as those of EVRC-B, as defined in [3], except that the mode
   change request field in the ToC MUST be interpreted according to the
   definition of the RATE_REDUC parameter as defined in EVRC-WB [5].
   The media type audio/EVRCWB maps to the interleaved/bundled packet
   format, audio/EVRCWB0 maps to the header-free packet format, and
   audio/EVRCWB1 maps to the compact bundled packet format.

RFC 5188               EVRC-WB RTP Payload Format          February 2008


7.  Congestion Control Considerations

   Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550
   [6], and with any applicable RTP profile, e.g., RFC 3551 [11].

   Due to the header overhead, the number of frames encapsulated in each
   RTP packet influences the overall bandwidth of the RTP stream.
   Packing more frames in each RTP packet can reduce the number of
   packets sent and hence the header overhead, at the expense of
   increased delay and reduced error robustness.

8.  Storage Format for the EVRC-WB Codec

   The storage format is used for storing EVRC-WB encoded speech frames,
   e.g., as a file or email attachment.

   The file begins with a magic number to identify the vocoder that is
   used.  The magic number for EVRC-WB corresponds to the ASCII
   character string "#!EVCWB\n", i.e., "0x23 0x21 0x45 0x56 0x43 0x57
   0x42 0x0A".

   The codec data frames are stored in consecutive order, with a single
   ToC entry field, extended to one octet, prefixing each codec data
   frame.  The ToC field is extended to one octet by setting the four
   most significant bits of the octet to zero.  For example, a ToC value
   of 4 (a full-rate frame) is stored as 0x04.  See Section 4 for the
   mapping from frame type to ToC value.

   Speech frames lost in transmission and non-received frames MUST be
   stored as erasure frames (ToC value of 5) to maintain synchronization
   with the original media.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document updates the audio/EVRCB and audio/EVRCB0 media types
   defined in RFC 4788 [3] and adds new EVRC-WB 'audio' media subtypes.

9.1.  Media Type Registrations

   Following the guidelines in RFC 4855 [9] and RFC 4288 [10], this
   section registers new 'audio' media subtypes for EVRC-WB and updates
   the audio/EVRCB and audio/EVRCB0 media type registrations contained
   in RFC 4788 [3].

10.  SDP Mode Attributes for EVRC-WB and EVRC-B

   'sendmode' can be used by a sender (EVRC-WB or EVRC-B) to announce
   its encoder's current mode of operation.  A sender can change its
   mode anytime, and this does not cause any decoding problems at the
   receiver.

   'recvmode' is defined for use with EVRC-B.  A decoder can use this
   attribute to inform an encoder of its preference to operate in a
   specified mode.  The receiver will continue to decode properly even
   if the sender does not operate in the preferred mode.

   'mode-set-recv' is defined for use with EVRC-WB.  A decoder can use
   this attribute to inform an encoder of its preference to operate in a
   specified subset of modes.  The receiver will continue to decode
   properly even if the sender does not operate in one of the preferred
   modes.  A set has been defined so that several modes can be expressed
   as a preference in one attempt.  For instance, the set {4,7} signals
   that the receiver prefers the sender to operate in narrowband modes
   of EVRC-WB.

11.  EVRC-B Interoperability with Legacy Implementations (RFC 4788)

   This document adds new optional parameters "recvmode" and "sendmode"
   to the original EVRC-B media types "audio/EVRCB" and "audio/EVRCB0"
   defined in RFC 4788 [3].  Existing RFC 4788 [3] implementations will
   not send these parameters in the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   and will ignore them if they are received.  This will allow

   interoperability between RFC 4788 [3] and RFC 5188 implementations of
   EVRC-B.  For an example offer-and-answer exchange, see Section 17.

12.  Mapping EVRC-WB Media Type Parameters into SDP

   Information carried in the media type specification has a specific
   mapping to fields in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [8],
   which is commonly used to describe RTP sessions.  When SDP is used to
   specify sessions employing EVRC-WB encoded speech, the mapping is as
   follows.

   o  The media type ("audio") goes in SDP "m=" as the media name.

   o  The media subtype ("EVRCWB", "EVRCWB0", or "EVRCWB1") goes in SDP
      "a=rtpmap" as the encoding name.

   o  The optional parameters 'ptime' and 'maxptime' (for subtypes
      EVRCWB, EVRCWB1) go in the SDP "a=ptime" and "a=maxptime"
      attributes, respectively.

   o  Any remaining parameters (for subtypes EVRCWB, EVRCWB0, and
      EVRCWB1) go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by copying them from the
      media type string as a semicolon-separated list of parameter=value
      pairs.

13.  Mapping EVRC-B Media Type Parameters into SDP

   The new optional parameters 'recvmode' and 'sendmode' (for 'audio'
   subtypes EVRCB and EVRCB0) go in the SDP "a=fmtp" attribute by
   copying them directly from the media type string.

   For all other media type parameters, the specification in Section 6.7
   of RFC 4788 [3] still applies.

14.  Offer-Answer Model Considerations for EVRC-WB

   The following considerations apply when using the SDP offer-answer
   procedures of RFC 3264 [7] to negotiate the use of EVRC-WB payload in
   RTP:

   o  Since EVRC-WB is an extension of EVRC-B, the offerer SHOULD
      announce EVRC-B support in its "m=audio" line, with EVRC-WB as the
      preferred codec.  This will allow interoperability with an
      answerer that supports only EVRC-B.







Desineni & Xie              Standards Track                    [Page 16]

RFC 5188               EVRC-WB RTP Payload Format          February 2008


   Below is an example of such an offer:

          m=audio 55954 RTP/AVP 98 99
          a=rtpmap:98 EVRCWB0/16000
          a=rtpmap:99 EVRCB0/8000
          a=fmtp:98 mode-set-recv=0,4;sendmode=0
          a=fmtp:99 recvmode=0 sendmode=4

   If the answerer supports EVRC-WB, then the answerer can keep the
   payload type 98 in its answer and the conversation can be done using
   EVRC-WB.  Else, if the answerer supports only EVRC-B, then the
   answerer will leave only the payload type 99 in its answer and the
   conversation will be done using EVRC-B.

   An example answer for the above offer is the following:

          m=audio 55954 RTP/AVP 98
          a=rtpmap:98 EVRCWB0/16000
          a=fmtp:98 mode-set-recv=4;sendmode=4

   o  'mode-set-recv' is a unidirectional receive-only parameter.

   o  'sendmode' is a unidirectional send-only parameter.

   o  Using 'sendmode', a sender can signal its current mode of
      operation.  Note that a receiver may receive RTP media well before
      the arrival of SDP with a (first-time, or updated) 'sendmode'
      parameter.

   o  An offerer can use 'mode-set-recv' to request that the remote
      sender's encoder be limited to the list of modes signaled in
      'mode-set-recv'.  A remote sender MAY ignore 'mode-set-recv'
      requests.

   o  The parameters 'maxptime' and 'ptime' will in most cases not
      affect interoperability; however, the setting of the parameters
      can affect the performance of the application.  The SDP offer-
      answer handling of the 'ptime' parameter is described in RFC 3264
      [7].  The 'maxptime' parameter MUST be handled in the same way.

   o  For a sendonly stream, the 'mode-set-recv' parameter is not useful
      and SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  For a recvonly stream, the 'sendmode' parameter is not useful and
      SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  When using EVRCWB1, the entire session MUST use the same fixed
      rate and mode (0-Wideband or 4,7-Narrowband).

RFC 5188               EVRC-WB RTP Payload Format          February 2008


   o  For additional rules that MUST be followed while negotiating DTX
      parameters, see Section 6.8 in [3].

   o  Any unknown parameter in an SDP offer MUST be ignored by the
      receiver and MUST NOT be included in the SDP answer.

15.  Offer-Answer Model Considerations for EVRC-B

   See Section 6.8 of [3] for offer-answer usage of EVRC-B.  The
   following are several additional considerations for EVRC-B.

   o  'recvmode' is a unidirectional receive-only parameter.

   o  'sendmode' is a unidirectional send-only parameter.

   o  Using 'recvmode', a receiver can signal the remote sender to
      operate its encoder in the specified mode.  A remote sender MAY
      ignore 'recvmode' requests.

   o  Using 'sendmode', a sender can signal its current mode of
      operation.  Note that a receiver may receive RTP media well before
      the arrival of SDP with a (first-time, or updated) 'sendmode'
      parameter.

   o  For a sendonly stream, the 'recvmode' parameter is not useful and
      SHOULD NOT be used.

   o  For a recvonly stream, the 'sendmode' parameter is not useful and
      SHOULD NOT be used.

16.  Declarative SDP Considerations

   For declarative use of SDP in the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)
   [12] and the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) [13], the following
   considerations apply:

   o  Any 'maxptime' and 'ptime' values should be selected with care to
      ensure that the session's participants can achieve reasonable
      performance.

   o  The payload format configuration parameters are all declarative,
      and a participant MUST use the configuration(s) that is provided
      for the session.  More than one configuration may be provided if
      necessary by declaring multiple RTP payload types; however, the
      number of types should be kept small.  For declarative examples,
      see Section 17.

17.  Examples

   Some example SDP session descriptions utilizing EVRC-WB and EVRC-B
   encodings follow.  In these examples, long a=fmtp lines are folded to
   meet the column width constraints of this document.  The backslash
   ("\") at the end of a line and the carriage return that follows it
   should be ignored.  Note that media subtype names are case-
   insensitive.  Parameter names are case-insensitive both in media
   types and in the mapping to the SDP a=fmtp attribute.

     Example usage of EVRCWB:

        m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 98
        a=rtpmap:97 EVRCWB/16000
        a=rtpmap:98 EVRCB0/8000
        a=fmtp:97 mode-set-recv=0,4;sendmode=0
        a=fmtp:98 recvmode=0 sendmode=0
        a=maxptime:120

     Example usage of EVRCWB0:

        m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 98
        a=rtpmap:97 EVRCWB0/16000
        a=rtpmap:98 EVRCB0/8000
        a=fmtp:97 mode-set-recv=0,4;sendmode=0
        a=fmtp:98 recvmode=0 sendmode=0

     Example SDP answer from a media gateway requesting a terminal to
     limit its encoder operation to EVRC-WB mode 4:

        m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97
        a=rtpmap:97 EVRCWB0/16000
        a=fmtp:97 mode-set-recv=4;sendmode=4

     Example usage of EVRCWB1:

       m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97 98
       a=rtpmap:97 EVRCWB1/16000
       a=fmtp:97 mode-set-recv=4;sendmode=4
       a=maxptime:100

     In the above example, note that the answerer has chosen
     to send in mode 4 even though the offerer was willing to
     receive in mode 0. 'recvmode' is a receiver's preference,
     but the sender can send in a different mode.

18.  Security Considerations

   Since compression is applied to the payload formats end-to-end, and
   the encodings do not exhibit significant non-uniformity,
   implementations of this specification are subject to all the security
   considerations specified in RFC 3558 [2].  Implementations using the
   payload defined in this specification are subject to the security
   considerations discussed in RFC 3558 [2], RFC 3550 [6], and any
   appropriate profile (for example, RFC 3551 [11]).

19.  Changes to RFC 4788

   This document updates RFC 4788 [3], and the updates are summarized
   below:

   o  Added new media type attribute "sendmode" to media subtypes EVRCB
      and EVRCB0.  This attribute can be used to signal the EVRC-B
      encoder's current mode of operation.

   o  Added new media type attribute "recvmode" to media subtypes EVRCB
      and EVRCB0.  This attribute can be used to signal the EVRC-B
      decoder's preferred operating mode to a remote sender.
