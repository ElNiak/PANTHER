Abstract

   This document describes a protocol for the registration and
   management of second level domain names and associated name servers
   in both generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) and country code Top Level
   Domains (ccTLDs). This protocol was developed by the Network
   Solutions Registry for use within the Shared Registration System and
   is being published "as-is" to document the protocol implementation
   developed by the Network Solutions, Inc. Registry.

   Internet domain name registration typically involves three entities:
   a registrant who wishes to register a domain name, a registrar who
   provides services to the registrant, and a registry that provides
   services to the registrar while serving as the authoritative
   repository of all functional information required to resolve names
   registered in the registry's TLDs.  This document describes a
   protocol for registry-registrar communication only.  The protocol
   does not provide any registrant services.

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


1. Introduction

   This document describes the specifications for the NSI Registry
   Registrar Protocol (RRP) version 1.1.0, a TCP-based, 7-bit US-ASCII
   text protocol that permits multiple registrars to provide second
   level Internet domain name registration services in the top level
   domains (TLDs) administered by a TLD registry. RRP is specified using
   Augmented Backus-Nauer Form (ABNF) as described in [ABNF]. Note that
   all ABNF string literals are case-insensitive and the examples
   provided in this document may use mixed case to improve readability.

   RRP was developed by the Network Solutions, Inc. Registry under the
   auspices of the Shared Registration System program. The protocol was
   initially deployed in April 1999 as part of a test bed implementation
   of the Shared Registration System with five registrars. Additional
   registrars began using the protocol in July 1999. The operational
   experiences of both the registry and the registrars identified
   several "lessons learned" which have been documented here as "Known
   Issues".

   This document provides both a description of a protocol and notice of
   learned operational issues that may be useful as first steps in
   developing a standards track domain registration services protocol.
   This document and the protocol it describes may be modified in the
   future based on continued operational experience and community
   reaction.

   The registry stores information about registered domain names and
   associated name servers. A domain name's data includes its name, name
   servers, registrar, registration expiration date, and status. A name
   server's data includes its server name, IP addresses, and registrar.
   A registrar MAY perform the following registration service procedures
   using RRP:

   - Determine if a domain name has been registered.
   - Register a domain name.
   - Renew the registration of a domain name.
   - Cancel the registration of a domain name.
   - Update the name servers of a domain name.
   - Transfer a domain name from another registrar.
   - Examine the status of domain names that the registrar has
     registered.
   - Modify the status of domain names that the registrar has
     registered.
   - Determine if a name server has been registered.
   - Register a name server.
   - Update the IP addresses of a name server.

   - Delete a name server.
   - Examine the status of name servers that the registrar has
     registered.

   All RRP commands include features to provide idempotency.  That is,
   the effect of each command is the same if the command is executed
   once or if the command is executed multiple times. This property is
   extremely useful in situations when a command is retried due to an
   error condition that results in a missed command response and a
   command retry is attempted. Command retries will be caught by the
   System and rejected with an appropriate error response code. Command
   parameters that do not provide idempotency will be explained fully as
   part of the appropriate command description.

2. Security Services

   RRP provides only basic password-based registrar authentication
   services.  Additional security services, including privacy and
   registrar authentication using public key cryptography, are provided
   through other System features.

2.1 Connection Security

   Each RRP session MUST be encrypted using the Secure Socket Layer
   (SSL) v3.0 protocol as specified in [SSL]. SSL provides privacy
   services that reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosure of
   registrar-sensitive information, such as the registrar's user
   identifier and password.

   SSL supports mutual authentication of both the client and server
   using signed digital certificates. The Shared Registration System
   implemented by the NSI Registry requires digital certificates issued
   by a commercial certification authority for both registrar clients
   and public registry RRP servers. Both the registrar client and the
   public registry RRP server are authenticated when establishing an SSL
   connection. Further, a registrar MUST be authenticated when
   establishing an RRP connection via the RRP SESSION command by
   providing a registrar user identifier and password known only to the
   registrar and the System. Registrars may change their session
   password at any time using the RRP SESSION command.

   The SSL protocol is not an IETF Standards Track protocol. The
   Transport Layer Security protocol, specified in [TLS], is a Standards
   Track protocol that provides SSL v3.0 compatibility features.

2.2 System Data Security

   The System stores information about the registered domain names and
   their name servers.  Only the current registrar of a registered
   domain name is authorized to query it, update its name servers, and
   cancel or renew it. Any registrar can request a transfer of a domain
   name and its associated name servers from another registrar to the
   requesting registrar. Only the current sponsoring registrar can
   receive and explicitly approve or reject domain transfer requests.

   Only a name server's registrar can query, update, and delete it.  In
   general, name servers must be registered through the current
   registrar of the name server's parent domain name, though an
   implementation MAY allow use of name servers registered in other TLDs
   without specifying IP addresses or requiring parent domain
   registration. Use of ccTLD name servers for a gTLD domain name is one
   such example.

   Name servers are implicitly transferred by the System when their
   parent domain name is transferred. In addition, a name server cannot
   be deleted if it is hosting domain names.

3. Connection Model

   IANA has assigned TCP port 648 for RRP use. All RRP implementations
   MUST provide RRP services over SSL on TCP port 648. An RRP server
   MUST return a banner in the following format to confirm that a
   connection has been established:

   <registry name> RRP Server version <version><crlf>
   <server build date and time><crlf>

   Each line ends with carriage return and line feed characters. The
   server build date and time string includes the day, month, date, time
   (specified in hours, minutes, and seconds), the local time zone, and
   the four-digit year. A dot (".") in column one on a line by itself
   marks the end of banner text.

   Example

   A registrar successfully establishes a connection with the NSI
   Registry on TCP port 648:

   S:NSI RRP Server version 1.1.0
   S:Mon Oct 25 20:20:34 EDT 1999
   S:.

4. Protocol Description

   A typical RRP session will go through a number of states during its
   lifetime.  Figure 1 illustrates the possible states of an RRP server.

   Initially, the server waits for a client connection and
   authentication (PRE).  All client connections MUST be authenticated.

             +-----------+          QUIT       +--------------------+

                Figure 1: RRP Server Finite State Machine

   If the authentication fails, the server gives the client another
   chance to identify itself (WFR). If the authentication fails again,
   the server disconnects (DIS).  Otherwise, the server waits for a
   request from the client (WFC).  Upon receiving a request, the server
   executes it and responds to the client with the result (EXE). The
   server then waits again for another request from the client (WFC). If
   the client sends a QUIT command, the server ends the session and
   disconnects (DIS). To keep its state in sync with that of the server,
   the client SHOULD wait for a response from the server before sending
   another request on the same connection.  The following table
   summarizes these states:





Hollenbeck & Srivastava      Informational                      [Page 6]

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


        PRE     Waiting for client connection and authentication
        WFR     Waiting for authentication retry
        WFC     Waiting for a command from an authenticated client
        EXE     Executing a command
        DIS     Disconnected

   The WFR and WFC states MAY time out. An implementation SHOULD define
   inactivity timeout periods for these states based on System-specific
   factors, including (but not limited to) resource availability and
   security risk. In the absence of other factors, a default timeout
   period of 10 minutes SHOULD be used. The server MAY disconnect if the
   server is in one of these states and no message is received from the
   client during the timeout period.

4.1 Request Format

   An RRP request nominally consists of a command name, an entity block,
   command options, and an end-of-command delimiter. Command options and
   entity blocks collectively define command parameters and their
   specification is order independent; examples provided in this
   document specify entity blocks before command options.

     CommandName [EntityBlock] [CommandOptions] EndOfCommand

   A command name specifies the type of an RRP request.  A command is a
   word or abbreviation terminated by a carriage-return linefeed (crlf)
   sequence.

     CommandName<crlf>

   An entity block specifies the data in an RRP request. It consists of
   attribute name-value pairs specifying the entity and all of the
   attributes of the entity.  Each attribute name-value pair starts with
   the attribute name, followed by a colon, the attribute value, and is
   finally terminated by a carriage-return linefeed sequence.  Entity
   blocks are optional for some requests.

     entityName:entityValue<crlf>
     attributeName:attributeValue<crlf>

   Command options specify control parameters for an RRP request. A
   command option starts with a dash, followed by the option name, a
   colon, the option value, and is finally terminated by a carriage-
   return linefeed sequence.

     -commandOptionName:commandOptionValue<crlf>





Hollenbeck & Srivastava      Informational                      [Page 7]

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   An EndOfCommand delimiter specifies the end of an RRP request.  It
   consists of a dot (".") in column one followed by a carriage-return
   linefeed sequence.

     .<crlf>

4.2 Response Format

   An RRP response starts with a three-digit response code, followed by
   a space, an ASCII text description of the response, a carriage-return
   linefeed sequence, and zero or more attribute name-value pair lines.
   An RRP response is terminated by a dot in column one followed by a
   carriage-return linefeed sequence.

     ResponseCode<space>responseDescription<crlf>
     [attributeName:attributeValue<crlf>]
     .<crlf>

4.3 Protocol Commands

   Implementations of RRP commands MUST provide "all or nothing" success
   and failure operation. Failed command execution MUST leave the System
   in the same state it was in before the command was attempted and
   failed.

   All RRP commands include features to provide idempotency. Command
   features that are not idempotent are explained fully as needed as
   part of the appropriate command description.

4.3.1 ADD

   This command allows a registrar to register a domain name or a name
   server in the System.

4.3.1.1 Registering a Domain Name

   The request to register a domain name MUST contain the following
   data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "Domain".
   - Fully qualified second level domain name in the "DomainName"
     parameter.









Hollenbeck & Srivastava      Informational                      [Page 8]

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   The request to register a domain name MAY contain 1 or more, and a
   maximum of 13, fully qualified name servers hosting the domain name
   in multiple instances of the "NameServer" parameter. The name servers
   MUST have already been registered in the registry. Implementations
   MAY allow specification of name servers associated with domains
   registered in other TLDs. For example, an implementation MAY allow
   use of ccTLD name servers for gTLD domain name registration.

   The request to register a domain name MAY contain the initial
   registration period in years for the domain being registered in a
   single instance of the "Period" parameter. The System MUST provide a
   default initial registration period in years if the "Period"
   parameter is not provided. The acceptable year values for the
   "Period" parameter are implementation specific.

   The System will register the domain name to the registrar for the
   period specified by the registrar. If the registrar does not specify
   a registration period, a System-specified default value MUST be used
   for the initial registration period. If the domain name is
   successfully registered, the System MUST return the registration
   expiration date in the "registration expiration date" attribute in
   the response.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the ADD command to register
   domain names.

   Examples

   A registrar registers a domain name without specifying name servers:

   C:add<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:-Period:10<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:registration expiration date:2009-09-22 10:27:00.0<crlf>
   S:status:ACTIVE<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   A registrar registers a domain name using previously-registered name
   servers:

   C:add<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example2.com<crlf>
   C:-Period:10<crlf>
   C:NameServer:ns1.example.com<crlf>
   C:NameServer:ns2.example.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:registration expiration date:2000-09-22 10:27:00.0<crlf>
   S:status:ACTIVE<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.1.2 Registering a Name Server

   The request to register a name server MUST contain the following
   data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "NameServer".
   - Fully qualified server name of the name server in the "NameServer"
     parameter.

   If the name server being registered is the child of a registered
   domain name, the name server registration request MUST include one or
   more, and a maximum of 13, name server IP addresses in multiple
   instances of the "IPAddress" parameter. Name servers associated with
   domains registered in other TLDs SHOULD NOT be specified with IP
   addresses to reduce the possibility of duplicating DNS NS records for
   the name servers in multiple zone files.

   The registrar MUST register the name server in the System before
   using it to host domain names. Further, the name server MUST be
   registered through the same registrar that is the current registrar
   of its parent domain name. The System MAY allow any registrar to use
   the name server to host domain names.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the ADD command to register
   name servers.

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   Examples

   A registrar registers a new name server in an existing domain name:

   C:add<crlf>
   C:EntityName:NameServer<crlf>
   C:NameServer:ns1.example.com<crlf>
   C:IPAddress:198.41.1.11<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.2 CHECK

   This command allows a registrar to determine if a domain name or name
   server has been registered in the System.

4.3.2.1 Domain Name Check

   The request to determine if a domain name is registered MUST contain
   the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "Domain".
     - Fully qualified second level domain name in the "DomainName"
     parameter.

   The System MUST provide a positive or negative response to document
   domain name availability at the moment the command is executed.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the CHECK command to
   determine if a domain name has been registered or not.

   Examples

   A registrar checks the availability of a domain name in the System:

   C:check<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:211 Domain name not available<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.2.2 Name Server Check

   The request to determine if a name server is registered MUST contain
   the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "NameServer".
   - Fully qualified server name in the "NameServer" parameter.

   The System MUST provide a positive or negative response to document
   name server availability at the moment the command is executed. If
   the name server has been registered, the System MUST return the IP
   address(es) of the name server.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the CHECK command to
   determine if a name server has been registered or not.

   Examples

   A registrar checks the availability of a server name in the System:

   C:check<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Nameserver<crlf>
   C:Nameserver:ns1.example.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:213 Name server not available<crlf>
   S:ipAddress:192.10.10.10<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.3 DEL

   This command allows a registrar to delete (cancel the registration)
   of a domain name or delete a name server.

4.3.3.1 Deleting a Domain Name

   The request to cancel the registration of a domain name MUST contain
   the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "Domain".
   - Fully qualified second level domain name in the "DomainName"
     parameter.

   A request to delete a domain name SHOULD cause the deletion of all
   name servers that are children of the domain name being deleted. The
   name servers SHOULD be deleted if they are not actively hosting other
   domains. A domain MUST not be deleted if it has child name servers
   hosting other domains.

   Authorized User: The current registrar of a domain name MAY use the
   DEL command to delete a domain name from the System.

   Examples

   A registrar deletes a domain name, implicitly deleting all name
   servers registered in the domain:

   C:del<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.3.2 Deleting a Name Server

   The request to delete a name server MUST contain the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "NameServer".
   - Fully qualified name of the name server in the "NameServer"
     parameter.

   A name server MUST not be deleted if it is hosting domains. Deleting
   such domains or name servers is prohibited because their deletion
   WILL result in orphaning the hosted domains.

   Authorized User: The current registrar of a name server MAY use the
   DEL command to delete a name server from the System.

   Examples

   A registrar deletes a name server that is not hosting domains:

   C:del<crlf>
   C:EntityName:NameServer<crlf>
   C:NameServer:ns1.registrarA.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>

4.3.4 DESCRIBE

   This command allows a registrar to obtain general information about
   an RRP implementation. The command MAY contain the following
   parameters:

   - The "Target" parameter set to value "Protocol".

   The implementation MUST return the protocol version number whether or
   not the request contains the "Target" parameter.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the DESCRIBE command.

   Examples

   A registrar obtains general information about an RRP implementation:

   C:describe<crlf>
   C:-Target:Protocol<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:Protocol:RRP 1.1.0<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.5 MOD

   This command allows a registrar to update a registered domain name or
   a name server. The command allows the following operations on an
   attribute value for both single-valued and multi-valued attributes:

   - Add an attribute value. The value to be added MUST be unique among
     the values of the attribute. For a single-valued attribute, it
     replaces the current value.
   - Remove an attribute value. The value to be removed MUST exist.
     Further, an attribute value cannot be removed if it is the only
     value of a required attribute.

   Attribute values to be removed are identified by tagging with an "="
   suffix.

4.3.5.1 Domain Modification

   The request to modify a registered domain name MUST contain the
   following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "Domain".
   - Fully qualified second level domain name in the "DomainName"
     parameter.

   The registrar can perform the following update operations on the
   domain name:

   - Update the name servers of the domain name by setting one or more
     instances of the "NameServer" parameter.
   - Update the status of the domain name by setting one or more
     instances of the "Status" parameter. Valid values for the "Status"
     parameter are defined in Section 6.

   Authorized User: The current registrar of a domain name MAY use the
   MOD command to modify the attributes of a domain name.

   Examples

   A registrar removes one name server (ns1) from a domain and adds a
   new name server (ns3) to the same domain:

   C:mod<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:NameServer:ns3.registrarA.com<crlf>
   C:NameServer:ns1.registrarA.com=<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.5.2 Name Server Modification

   The request to update a name server MUST contain the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "NameServer".
   - Fully qualified server name of the name server in the "NameServer"
     parameter.









Hollenbeck & Srivastava      Informational                     [Page 15]

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   The registrar can perform the following update operations on the name
   server:

   - Update the "NameServer" attribute of the name server. This allows a
     registrar to change the name of a name server while preserving all
     existing associations.
   - Update the IP addresses of the name server by setting one or more
     instances of the "IPAddress" parameter.

   Authorized User: The current registrar of a name server MAY use the
   MOD command to modify the attributes of a domain name.

   Examples

   A registrar changes the name and IP address of a name server:

   C:mod<crlf>
   C:EntityName:NameServer<crlf>
   C:NameServer:ns1.registrarA.com<crlf>
   C:NewNameServer:ns2.registrarA.com<crlf>

   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.6 QUIT

   This command allows a registrar to close an RRP connection. A
   response MUST be sent before closing the connection.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the QUIT command.

   Examples

   A registrar ends an RRP session and closes an existing connection:

   C:quit<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:220 Command completed successfully. Server closing connection<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.7 RENEW

   This command allows a registrar to renew a domain name in the System.
   The request to renew a domain name MUST contain the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "Domain".
   - Fully qualified second level domain name in the "DomainName"
     parameter.

   The request to renew a domain name MAY contain the renewal period in
   years for the domain being renewed in a single instance of a "Period"
   parameter and a single instance of a "CurrentExpirationYear"
   parameter. These parameters MUST appear together if either is
   specified, though the order in which the parameters appear is
   insignificant. The "Period" parameter identifies the number of years
   to be added to the registration. The "CurrentExpirationYear"
   parameter identifies the current expiration year, and is required to
   ensure that repeated attempts to retry this command do not result in
   multiple successful renewals. The System MUST provide a default
   number of renewal years if the "Period" and "CurrentExpirationYear"
   parameters are not provided. Repeated use of this command without the
   "Period" and "CurrentExpirationYear" parameters may result in
   repeated successful renewals since idempotency is not provided when
   these parameters are not used. The acceptable year values for the
   "Period" parameter are implementation specific subject to syntax
   restrictions.

   The System renews the domain name for a period specified by the
   registrar. If the domain name renewal is completed successfully, the
   System MUST return the new registration expiration date in the
   "RegistrationExpirationDate" attribute in the response.

   Authorized User: The current registrar of a domain name MAY use the
   RENEW command.

   Examples

   A registrar renews a domain name using a specified renewal period:

   C:renew<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:-Period:9<crlf>
   C:-CurrentExpirationYear:2001<crlf>

4.3.8 SESSION

   This command allows a registrar to establish an RRP session. A
   registrar can also use this command to change their password. The
   request to establish an RRP connection MUST contain the following
   command parameters:

   - The "Id" parameter set to the registrar's System user ID.
   - The "Password" parameter set to the registrar's current System
     password.

   The request to establish an RRP session MAY contain a new password
   for the registrar in a single instance of the "NewPassword"
   parameter.

   The registrar MUST send this command to the System before any other
   command.  If the command fails due to invalid information (such as an
   invalid registrar ID or password), the registrar can resend this
   request with corrected information. If the command fails a second
   time, the System SHOULD close the connection.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the SESSION command.

   Examples

   A registrar establishes an RRP session:

   C:session<crlf>
   C:-Id:registrarA<crlf>
   C:-Password:i-am-registrarA<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

4.3.9 STATUS

   This command allows a registrar to determine the current status of a
   domain name or name server.

4.3.9.1 Domain Status

   The request to query a domain name MUST contain the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "Domain".
   - Fully qualified second level domain name in the "DomainName"
     parameter.

   The response from the System MAY contain the following data:

   - Fully qualified server names of name servers hosting the domain
     name in multiple instances of the "nameserver" attribute.
   - Registration expiration date in the "registration expiration date"
     attribute.
   - ID of the current registrar of the domain name in the "registrar"
     attribute.
   - Date the domain name was transferred by the current registrar in
     the "registrar transfer date" attribute.
   - Current statuses of the domain name in multiple instances of the
     "status" attribute.
   - Date the domain name was originally registered in the "created
     date" attribute.
   - ID of the registrar that originally registered the domain name in
     the "created by" attribute.
   - Date the domain name was last updated in the "updated date"
     attribute.
   - ID of the entity (either a registrar or the registry) that last
     updated the domain name in the "updated by" attribute.

   Authorized User: The current registrar of a domain name MAY use the
   STATUS command to view current domain name attributes.

   Examples

   The current registrar of a domain name queries the domain name:

   - IP addresses of the name server in multiple instances of the
     "ipaddress" attribute.
   - ID of the current registrar of the name server in the "registrar"
     attribute.
   - Date the name server was transferred by the current registrar in
     the "registrar transfer date" attribute.
   - Date the name server was registered in the "created date"

4.3.10 TRANSFER

   This command allows a registrar to request transfer of domain name
   sponsorship from a second registrar and to approve or reject transfer
   requests initiated by other registrars. The request to transfer a
   domain name MUST contain the following data:

   - The "EntityName" parameter set to value "Domain".
   - Fully qualified second level domain name in the "DomainName"
     parameter.

   The identity of the requesting registrar is derived from the current
   active session. The identity of the current sponsoring registrar (the
   registrar who must approve or reject the transfer request) is known
   by the registry and does not need to be known by the requesting
   registrar in advance of issuing the transfer request.

   The System MUST notify the potential losing registrar when a domain
   transfer request has been received using an out-of-band transport
   mechanism such as electronic mail and/or transaction reporting. The
   losing registrar SHOULD then explicitly approve or reject the
   transfer. A request to approve or reject a transfer request MUST
   contain a single instance of the "Approve" parameter with a value of
   "Yes" to approve the transfer or a value of "No" to reject the
   transfer. A server implementation MAY provide a default approval or
   rejection action to be taken if the losing registrar does not
   explicitly approve or reject the transfer request within a fixed
   amount of time. The criteria used by registrars to approve or deny

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   requested transfers are typically based on business policies that are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   Approval of a transfer by the current sponsoring registrar results in
   a change of sponsorship to the original requesting registrar.
   Approval attempts by any other registrar MUST result in explicit
   failure of the attempted approval.  Rejection of the transfer by the
   current sponsoring registrar results in an end to the transfer
   request with no change in sponsorship. Rejection attempts by any
   other registrar MUST result in explicit failure of the attempted
   rejection.

   Name servers MUST be implicitly transferred when their parent domain
   name is transferred.

   Authorized User: All registrars MAY use the TRANSFER command to
   request transfer of registration service authority to the requesting
   registrar. Only the current sponsoring registrar of a domain name may
   explicitly approve or reject a requested transfer. The registry MAY
   implicitly approve or reject requested transfers after a fixed amount
   of time.

   Examples

   A registrar requests transfer of a domain name from another
   registrar:

   C:transfer<crlf>
   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>
   S:200 Command completed successfully<crlf>
   S:.<crlf>

   The original registrar approves the transfer request:

   C:EntityName:Domain<crlf>
   C:DomainName:example.com<crlf>
   C:.<crlf>

5. Response Codes

   RRP commands may return a variety of response codes to signify normal
   completion or error conditions. This section documents all of the
   defined RRP response codes.

5.1 Response Code Summary

   200 Command completed successfully
   This is the normal response for successful completion of most RRP
   commands.

   210 Domain name available
   This is the normal response for successful completion of an RRP CHECK
   command for a domain name that is not currently registered.

   211 Domain name not available
   This is the normal response for successful completion of an RRP CHECK
   command for a domain name that is currently registered.

   212 Name server available
   This is the normal response for successful completion of an RRP CHECK
   command for a name server that is not currently registered.

   213 Name server not available
   This is the normal response for successful completion of an RRP CHECK
   command for a name server that is currently registered.

   220 Command completed successfully. Server closing connection This is
   the normal response for successful completion of an RRP QUIT command.
   It may also be returned by other RRP commands if a transient
   situation is noted that requires closing the connection after
   successfully completing the RRP command.

   420 Command failed due to server error. Server closing connection A
   transient server error has caused RRP command failure and session
   termination. A new session must be established before continued
   processing can be attempted.

   421 Command failed due to server error. Client should try again A
   transient server error has caused RRP command failure. A subsequent
   retry may produce successful results.

   500 Invalid command name
   A client-specified RRP command name was not recognized as a valid RRP
   command name.

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   501 Invalid command option
   A client-specified RRP command parameter was not recognized as a
   valid RRP command parameter.

   502 Invalid entity value
   The "value" of an entity name-value pair is invalid. Command blocks
   that require an "EntityName" parameter also require a value that
   specifies the entity name, and the provided value is invalid.

   503 Invalid attribute name
   A client-specified RRP command parameter was not recognized as a
   valid RRP command parameter.

   504 Missing required attribute
   A parameter required to execute the RRP command was not provided by
   the client. The command should be retried with all required
   parameters specified.

   505 Invalid attribute value syntax
   A supplied parameter value is syntactically incorrect. For example, a
   year value digit such as "5" may be required but the client provided
   a string of characters such as "five".

   506 Invalid option value
   A client-specified value for an RRP command parameter is out-of-
   bounds or otherwise not within acceptable System limits.

   507 Invalid command format
   The specified command does not resemble a well-formed RRP command.
   The command should be retried using the proper command structure and
   syntax.

   508 Missing required entity
   An entity required for command completion was not provided by the
   client. For example, the CHECK command requires specification of
   either a "Domain" entity or a "Nameserver" entity.

   509 Missing command option
   A command parameter that isn't really optional (such as the registrar
   ID in a SESSION command) was not provided by the client. The command
   should be retried with all needed parameters.

   520 Server closing connection. Client should try opening new
   connection; <why>
   A timeout event has been detected, and the client's session is being
   ended.  The System SHOULD define timeout periods to begin a client

   command, complete a client command, and for the duration of an open
   session. The reason for the timeout MUST be provided at the end of
   the response code string.

   521 Too many sessions open. Server closing connection
   A System-defined limit on the number of open connections has been
   exceeded, and it is impossible to establish a new session at the
   moment. It may be possible to establish a session by waiting for a
   few moments or by closing existing unused sessions.

   530 Authentication failed
   The client-supplied registrar identifier or password was not
   recognized by the System. A subsequent retry with valid values may
   produce successful results. Repeated authorization failures MAY
   result in termination of the TCP connection.

   531 Authorization failed
   Registrars may not view or alter data associated with either the
   registry or another registrar. This response code is typically
   returned when a registrar attempts to view or modify data belonging
   to either the registry or another registrar. A typical situation
   includes doing a STATUS command for a domain registered to another
   registrar.

   532 Domain names linked with name server
   The name server is hosting active domains. This error occurs when a
   registrar is trying to delete a server that is the name server for
   active domains.  The registry MUST not allow the registrar to delete
   this server. All of the domain names using this server MUST be
   modified to use a different name server before the name server can be
   deleted.

   533 Domain name has active name servers
   The domain name has active name servers. The registrar is trying to
   delete a domain name that is a parent domain of an active name
   server, i.e., a server that is hosting active domains. All of the
   name servers within the domain MUST be removed from service before
   the domain can be deleted.

   534 Domain name has not been flagged for transfer
   The registrar is trying to approve or reject a domain name transfer
   for a domain name that is not pending transfer.

   535 Restricted IP address
   IANA identifies certain IP address ranges that are not valid for
   normal use.  The registrar is trying to use an IP address that is in
   a restricted IP address range as identified by IANA.

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   536 Domain already flagged for transfer
   The registrar tried to perform a transfer command for a domain name
   that is awaiting approval of an earlier transfer request.

   540 Attribute value is not unique
   A supplied attribute value is not unique. This occurs when the
   registrar is adding a domain name that already exists in the
   registry, a server that already exists in the registry, or an IP
   address that is already being used by another server in the registry.
   Another possibility occurs when performing domain modifications and
   the registrar is adding a server that is already in the list of
   servers for the domain name or setting a domain name to a status to
   which it is already set. The RRP STATUS command MAY be used to
   determine current domain name status before attempting to change the
   status. When modifying or adding a name server, the IP address of the
   name server might not be unique. The registry MUST not allow IP
   addresses to be used by more than one server.

   541 Invalid attribute value
   A supplied parameter value is invalid. Examples of invalid attribute
   values include an invalid IP address, an invalid domain name, an
   invalid server name, or an invalid renewal period.

   542 Invalid old value for an attribute
   A current attribute value to be modified is invalid. The registrar is
   trying to modify an attribute of a server or a domain name that does
   not exist in the registry.

   543 Final or implicit attribute cannot be updated
   The registrar is attempting to modify an attribute that is only
   modifiable by the registry. Registrars can not modify final or
   implicit attribute values.

   544 Entity on hold
   The attempted operation was rejected because the entity is on HOLD
   status. If the HOLD status was set by the registrar, the status can
   be changed using the MOD command and the requested command can be
   retried. If the HOLD status was set by the registry, the registrar
   must contact the registry to change the status before the command can
   be successful.

   545 Entity reference not found
   A required entity reference was not found. This occurs when the
   registrar tries to add a new name server and the parent domain of the
   name server does not exist in the registry. It also occurs when the
   user is trying to add a new name server to a domain name when the
   name server does not exist in the registry.

   546 Credit limit exceeded
   The registrar's credit limit has been exceeded. This is an
   implementation specific error that occurs when a potentially billable
   operation, such as adding a domain name, renewing a domain name, or
   transferring a domain name, is attempted and the registrar does not
   have sufficient financial standing with the registry to complete the
   operation.

   547 Invalid command sequence
   RRP commands are issued using a well-formed syntax that requires
   entry of command structures in particular sequences. This response
   code indicates that an ill-formed command was received and rejected.

   548 Domain is not up for renewal
   A RENEW command was attempted during a period in which the domain can
   not be renewed. Implementations MAY limit renewal periods to
   particular time frames, such as within 90 days of the domain's
   expiration. This response indicates that the RENEW command was
   received outside of the System-defined domain renewal period.

   549 Command failed
   A System error prevented successful completion of the requested RRP
   command.  Retrying the command might produce success, but a repeated
   failure indicates a System error condition.

   550 Parent domain not registered
   The parent domain of a name server being registered is not
   registered. This occurs when the registrar tries to add a new name
   server and the parent domain for the server does not exist in the
   registry.

   551 Parent domain status does not allow for operation
   The status of the parent domain does not allow the requested
   operation. This occurs when a registrar tries to modify a server
   whose parent domain is flagged as LOCK or HOLD in the registry.

   552 Domain status does not allow for operation
   The status of the domain does not allow the requested operation. This
   occurs when a registrar tries to modify or delete a domain that is
   flagged as LOCK or HOLD in the registry.

   553 Operation not allowed. Domain pending transfer
   The status of the domain does not allow the requested operation. The
   registrar is attempting to delete a domain that is pending approval
   or denial of a transfer request.

   554 Domain already registered
   A registrar tried to register a domain name that has already been
   registered by the same registrar.

   555 Domain already renewed
   A registrar tried to renew a domain using the same parameters as
   specified for an earlier, successful renewal. This will commonly
   occur when executing the same RENEW command more than once.

   556 Maximum registration period exceeded
   A registrar tried to renew a domain registration, and the resulting
   new registration period exceeds the System-defined maximum
   registration period. If there is renewal time available with the
   System-defined maximum registration period it may be possible to
   retry the RENEW command with specified renewal period parameters.

5.2 Command-Response Correspondence

   The session between the client and the server is intended to be an
   alternating dialogue. Each command issued by a client MUST be acted
   upon by the server, which MUST return a response code to document the
   success or failure of command execution. "Success" means that the
   command completed normal execution without error.  "Failure" means
   that the System did not complete the command as requested. Failure
   may be due to either syntax, semantic, data, or System errors.

   A complete list of response codes for each RRP command is listed
   below.

6. Domain Status Codes

   The status of a domain can be viewed using the RRP STATUS command and
   modified using the RRP MOD command. Both the registry and the
   sponsoring registrar MAY view and change the status of a domain. The
   criteria for status changes are highly dependent on registry and
   registrar business models and are thus beyond the scope of this
   specification.

   The domain's status SHOULD have a direct bearing on whether or not
   the domain appears in the appropriate TLD zone file and whether or
   not the domain can be modified. A domain can have more than one
   assigned status, e.g., REGISTRAR-HOLD and REGISTRAR-LOCK. If a domain
   is in ACTIVE status, then the domain name can only be in this status.
   When a registrar sets a domain name to REGISTRAR-LOCK, the registry
   MUST automatically remove the ACTIVE status. When the registrar
   removes the REGISTRAR-LOCK and other domain statuses, the registry
   MUST automatically set the domain name status to ACTIVE.

6.1 Domain Status Code Description

   ACTIVE: This is the default status of a domain at registration time.
   The registry sets the domain to this status. The domain is modifiable
   by the registrar. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL be
   included in the zone file when in this status if the domain has at
   least one associated name server.

   REGISTRY-LOCK: The registry sets the domain to this status. The
   domain cannot be modified or deleted by the registrar. The registry
   MUST remove the REGISTRY-LOCK status for the registrar to modify the
   domain. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL be included in
   the zone file when in this status if the domain has at least one
   associated name server.

   REGISTRY-HOLD: The registry sets the domain to this status. The
   domain cannot be modified or deleted by the registrar. The registry
   MUST remove the REGISTRY-HOLD status for the registrar to modify the
   domain. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL NOT be included
   in the zone file when in this status.

   REGISTRAR-HOLD: The registrar of the domain sets the domain to this
   status. The domain can not be modified or deleted when in this
   status. The registrar MUST remove REGISTRAR-HOLD status to modify the
   domain. The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL NOT be included
   in the zone file when in this status.

   REGISTRAR-LOCK: The registrar of the domain sets the domain to this
   status. The domain cannot be modified or deleted when in this status.
   The registrar MUST remove REGISTRAR-LOCK status to modify the domain.
   The domain can be renewed. The domain SHALL be included in the zone
   file when in this status.

   REGISTRY-DELETE-NOTIFY: A domain is set on this status if it has
   expired and has child name servers that are hosting other domains.
   Only the registry may set this status. The domain SHALL be included
   in the zone file when in this status if the domain has at least one
   associated name server.

8. Internationalization

   RRP is defined using 7-bit US-ASCII characters. Other character sets
   and character codes are not currently supported.

9. Known Issues

   RRP was not designed to provide bulk data query features. The primary
   goal of the original protocol designers was to provide a fast, light
   weight transactional protocol that could be implemented with minimal
   need for database queries that would take a "long" time to complete
   or that would return a "large" amount of data. Implementers SHOULD
   consider developing offline reporting features to provide bulk data
   for registrar reporting in a fashion suitable for the given
   registry-registrar operating environment.




Hollenbeck & Srivastava      Informational                     [Page 35]

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   This version of RRP does contain a few limitations noted over the
   course of several months of operational experience with live domain
   name registrars.  Later versions of this protocol or its successors
   should strive to resolve or address each of the following issues:

   The DESCRIBE command should return information describing System-
   defined default implementation values.

   Use of the RENEW command without the "CurrentExpirationYear" and
   "Period" parameters does not provide idempotency. Repeated execution
   of a RENEW command without these parameters can result in multiple
   successful RENEW commands, which may not be the desired action if a
   registrar is retrying a RENEW command due to network connectivity
   problems.

   Time stamps returned by RRP do not include time zone identifiers and
   SHOULD be interpreted as local registry time.

   The protocol does not provide features for a registrar to become
   aware of domain transfer requests and responses. Systems must rely on
   means outside of the protocol, such as electronic mail and/or
   registry-provided reports, to inform registrars of transfer requests
   and responses.

   The protocol does not provide features for a registrar to determine
   all of the domains served by a name server. Systems must provide this
   information using a method outside of the protocol, such as through
   periodic extracts from a System database.

   The protocol does not provide features to manage lame delegation of
   name servers. Any registrar may "use" name servers registered by
   another registrar.  When a registrar tries to delete a domain or name
   server it is quite possible that name servers in the domain to be
   deleted or the name server to be deleted will be associated with
   other live domains, precluding immediate deletion.  Systems must rely
   on means outside of the protocol to manage lame delegation of name
   servers.

   The use of "=" within the MOD command to indicate a value to be
   removed is somewhat confusing. A more explicit means of identifying
   old and new attribute values within the protocol syntax could make
   this feature more obvious.

   The CHECK command also returns name server IP addresses when
   returning positive confirmation of the registration of a name server.
   This extra information may be useful, but it is inconsistent with the
   limited function of the command.  The command should return a
   positive or negative response and nothing more.



Hollenbeck & Srivastava      Informational                     [Page 36]

RFC 2832            NSI Registry Registrar Protocol             May 2000


   The formal protocol syntax described in this document requires a
   specific order for the elements of a command entity block and command
   options. The NSI Registry's server-side implementation of the
   protocol provides the additional flexibility of allowing order
   independent specification of options and entity block elements.
   Client-side implementers are strongly urged to observe the order of
   command elements as specified here to ensure compliance if the more
   restricted form is enforced in the future.

   RRP does not return time stamps or transaction identifiers to track
   transactions. The NSI Registry provides registrars with daily and
   weekly reports that include time stamps in local registry time to
   document and synchronize data on a per-registrar basis.

10. Security Considerations

   Misuse of the Registry Registrar Protocol can have catastrophic
   operational consequences for registrants, registrars, and registries.
   As such, all registrars must be authenticated prior to all
   interactions with the registry.  In addition, all data exchanged
   between the registrar and the registry must be protected to avoid
   unintended disclosure of information.

11. IANA Considerations

   IANA assigned TCP port 648 for RRP use in November 1998. No other
   action is required of IANA to support operation of this protocol.

   IANA has reserved certain IPv4 address ranges as described in
   [ALLOCATION].  Implementers MUST ensure that name server IP addresses
   do not fall into one of the reserved address ranges to avoid
   operational DNS errors.
