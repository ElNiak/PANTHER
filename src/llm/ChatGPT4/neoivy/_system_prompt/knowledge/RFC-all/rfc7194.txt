1.  Rationale

   Although system port assignments exist for IRC traffic that is plain
   text (TCP/UDP port 194) or TLS/SSL encrypted (TCP/UDP port 994)
   [IANALIST], it is common practice amongst IRC networks not to use
   them for reasons of convenience and general availability on systems
   where no root access is granted or desired.

   IRC networks have defaulted to listening on TCP port 6667 for plain
   text connections for a considerable time now.  This is covered by the
   IRCU assignment of TCP/UDP ports 6665-6669.

   Similar consensus has been reached within the IRC community about
   listening on TCP port 6697 for incoming IRC connections encrypted via
   TLS/SSL [RFC5246].

2.  Technical Details

2.1.  Connection Establishment

   An IRC client connects to an IRC server.  Immediately after that, a
   normal TLS/SSL handshake takes place.  Once the TLS/SSL connection
   has been established, a normal IRC connection is established via the
   tunnel.  Optionally, the IRC server may set a specific user mode
   (umode) for the client, marking it as using TLS/SSL.  Again,
   optionally, an IRC server might offer the option to create channels
   in such a way that only clients connected via TLS/SSL may join.

   For details on how IRC works, see [RFC1459], [RFC2810], [RFC2811],
   [RFC2812], and [RFC2813].  Please note that IRC is extremely
   fragmented, and implementation details can vary wildly.  Most
   implementations regard the latter RFCs as suggestions, not as
   binding.

2.2.  Certificate Details

2.2.1.  Server Certificate

   The IRC server's certificate should be issued by a commonly trusted
   certification authority (CA).

   The Common Name should match the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
   of the IRC server or have appropriate wildcards, if applicable.

   The IRC client should verify the certificate.

2.2.2.  Client Certificate

   If the client is using a certificate as well, it should be issued by
   a commonly trusted CA or a CA designated by the IRC network.

   The certificate's Common Name should match the main IRC nickname.

   If the network offers nick registration, this nick should be used.

   If the network offers grouped nicks, the main nick or account name
   should be used.

   If the network offers nick registration, the client certificate
   should be used to identify the user against the nick database.  See
   [CERTFP] for a possible implementation.

3.  Security Considerations

   The lack of a common, well-established listening port for IRC via
   TLS/SSL could lead to end users being unaware of their IRC network of
   choice supporting TLS/SSL.  Thus, they might not use encryption even
   if they wanted to.

   It should be noted that this document merely describes client-to-
   server encryption.  There are still other attack vectors like
   malicious administrators, compromised servers, insecure server-to-
   server communication, channels that do not enforce encryption for all
   channel members, malicious clients, or comprised client machines on
   which logs are stored.

   Those attacks can by their very nature not be addressed by client-to-
   server encryption.  Additional safeguards are needed if a user fears
   any of the threats above.

   This document does not address server links as there are no commonly
   accepted ports or even back-end protocols.  Ports and back-end
   protocols are normally established in a bilateral agreement.  All
   operators are encouraged to use strong encryption for back-end
   traffic, no matter if they offer IRC via TLS/SSL to end users.

4.  IANA Considerations

   An assignment of TCP port 6697 for IRC via TLS/SSL has been made.
   The service name is "ircs-u" and the description "Internet Relay Chat
   via TLS/SSL":

   ircs-u  6697/tcp       Internet Relay Chat via TLS/SSL

   Thanks go to the IRC community at large for reaching a consensus.

   Special thanks go to the IRC operators who were eager to support port
   6697 on their respective networks.

   Special thanks also go to Nevil Brownlee and James Schaad for working
   on this document in their capacities as Independent Submissions
   Editor and Reviewer, respectively.

Appendix A.  Supporting Data

   As of October 2010, out of the top twenty IRC networks [TOP100]
   [MAVERICK], ten support TLS/SSL.  Only one of those networks does not
   support TLS/SSL via port 6697 and has no plans to support it.  All
   others supported it already or are supporting it since being
   contacted by the author.  A more detailed analysis is available but
   does not fit within the scope of this document.
