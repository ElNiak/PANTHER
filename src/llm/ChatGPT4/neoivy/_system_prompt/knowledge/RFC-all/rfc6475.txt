1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

2.1.  The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Protocol Entities

   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) [RFC5213] is an extension to the Mobile
   IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol that facilitates network-based localized
   mobility management (NETLMM) for IPv6 nodes in a PMIPv6 domain.
   There are three types of entities envisaged by the PMIPv6 protocol.

   mobile node (MN): In the PMIPv6 context, this term is used to refer
   to an IP host or router whose mobility is managed by the network.

   local mobility anchor (LMA): Local Mobility Anchor is the home agent
   for the mobile node in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain.  It is the
   topological anchor point for the mobile node's home network
   prefix(es) and is the entity that manages the mobile node's binding
   state.  The local mobility anchor has the functional capabilities of
   a home agent as defined in the Mobile IPv6 base specification
   [RFC6275] with the additional capabilities required for supporting
   the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol as defined in the PMIPv6 specification
   [RFC5213].

   mobile access gateway (MAG): Mobile Access Gateway is the entity on
   an access router that manages the mobility-related signaling for a
   mobile node that is attached to its access link.  It is responsible
   for tracking the mobile node's movements to and from the access link
   and for signaling the mobile node's local mobility anchor.

   This document defines a set of managed objects (MOs) that can be used
   to monitor and control PMIPv6 entities.

2.2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is consistent with the
   definitions used in the Mobile IPv6 protocol specification [RFC6275]
   and in the NETLMM goals document [RFC4831].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Proxy Mobile IPv6 Monitoring and Control Requirements

   For managing a PMIPv6 entity, it is necessary to monitor the
   following:

      o  capabilities of PMIPv6 entities
      o  signaling traffic due to PMIPv6 signaling
      o  binding-related details (at LMA and MAG)
      o  binding-related statistics (at LMA and MAG)

4.  MIB Design

   The basic principle has been to keep the MIB as simple as possible
   and, at the same time, to make it effective enough so that the
   essential needs of monitoring and control are met.

   The Proxy Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base (PMIPV6-MIB)
   extends the Mobile IPv6 Management Information Base (MIPV6-MIB)
   [RFC4295].  It is assumed that PMIPV6-MIB will always be implemented
   in conjunction with the MOBILEIPV6-MIB [RFC4295].  The PMIPV6-MIB
   uses the textual conventions defined in the INET-ADDRESS-MIB
   [RFC4001] and IP-MIB [RFC4293].

   The PMIPV6-MIB is composed of the following groups of definitions:

      - pmip6Core: a generic group containing objects that are common to
        all the Proxy Mobile IPv6 entities.  Objects belonging to this
        group will be implemented on the corresponding Proxy Mobile IPv6
        entity. pmip6BindingCacheTable belongs to this group.

      - pmip6Mag: this group models the mobile access gateway service.
        Objects belonging to this group have the "pmip6Mag" prefix and
        will be implemented on the corresponding MAG.

      - pmip6Lma: this group models the local mobility anchor service.
        Objects belonging to this group have the "pmip6Lma" prefix and
        will be implemented on the corresponding LMA.

RFC 6475                       PMIPV6-MIB                       May 2012


      - pmip6Notifications: defines the set of notifications that will
        be used to asynchronously monitor the Proxy Mobile IPv6
        entities.

        The tables contained in the above groups are as follows:

      - pmip6BindingCacheTable: models the Binding Cache on the local
        mobility anchor.

      - pmip6MagProxyCOATable: models the Proxy Care-of Addresses
        configured on the egress interfaces of the mobile access
        gateway.

      - pmip6MagMnIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the MAG-
        internal pmip6MagMnIndex to the mobile node identifier.

      - pmip6MagMnLLIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the MAG-
        internal pmip6MagMnLLIndex to the corresponding interface of the
        mobile node link-layer identifier.

      - pmip6MagHomeNetworkPrefixTable: contains the home network
        prefixes assigned to interfaces of all mobile nodes attached to
        the MAG.  Each interface is distinguished by the attached mobile
        node identifier (MN-Identifier) and the link-layer identifier
        (MN-LL-Identifier).

      - pmip6MagBLTable: models the Binding Update List (BL) that
        includes PMIPv6-related information and is maintained by the
        mobile access gateway.

      - pmip6MagMnProfileTable: contains the mobile node's policy
        profile that includes the essential operational parameters that
        are required by the network entities for managing the mobile
        node's mobility service.

      - pmip6LmaLMAATable: contains the LMA Addresses (LMAAs) that are
        configured on the local mobility anchor.  Each LMA Address acts
        as a transport endpoint of the tunnel between the local mobility
        anchor and the mobile access gateway.

      - pmip6LmaMnIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the LMA-
        internal pmip6BindingMnIndex to the mobile node identifier.

      - pmip6LmaMnLLIdentifierTable: provides a mapping from the LMA-
        internal pmip6BindingMnLLIndex to the corresponding interface of
        the mobile node link-layer identifier.

      - pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixTable: contains the list of home
        network prefixes assigned to the connected interfaces of the
        mobile nodes anchored on an LMA.

4.1.  Textual Conventions

        A Proxy Mobile IPv6 Textual Conventions MIB module containing
        Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Proxy Mobile IPv6
        management information is defined.  The intent is that these
        TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in
        PMIPv6-related MIB modules that would otherwise define their own
        representation(s).  This MIB module includes references to RFC
        4283 [RFC4283] and RFC 5213 [RFC5213].

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.  These
   are the tables and objects and the corresponding
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      The value of the following objects is used to enable or disable
      the PMIPv6 functionality on the corresponding PMIPv6 entity.
      Access to these MOs may be abused to disrupt the communication
      that depends on the PMIPv6 functionality.
         pmip6MagStatus
         pmip6LmaStatus

      Access to the following MOs may be abused to misconfigure PMIPv6
      entities and disrupt communications.
         pmip6MobileNodeGeneratedTimestampInUse
         pmip6FixedMagLinkLocalAddressOnAllAccessLinksType
         pmip6FixedMagLinkLocalAddressOnAllAccessLinks
         pmip6FixedMagLinkLayerAddressOnAllAccessLinks
         pmip6MagEnableMagLocalRouting
         pmip6MagHomeNetworkPrefixLifeTime
         pmip6LmaMinDelayBeforeBCEDelete
         pmip6LmaMaxDelayBeforeNewBCEAssign
         pmip6LmaTimestampValidityWindow

         pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixLifeTime

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      The following address-related objects may be considered to be
      particularly sensitive and/or private.

         pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixType
         pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefix
         pmip6LmaHomeNetworkPrefixLength

      The following MN Identifier-related MOs may be used to identify
      users.  These may be considered to be sensitive and/or private.

         pmip6MagMnIdentifier
         pmip6MagMnLLIdentifier
         pmip6LmaMnIdentifier
         pmip6LmaMnLLIdentifier
         pmip6MagProfMnIdentifier

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Implementations MUST provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), including full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator

   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the following:

      1. a base arc in the 'mib-2' (Standards Track) OID tree for the
         'pmip6TCMIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the PMIPV6-TC-MIB.

      2. a base arc in the 'mib-2' (Standards Track) OID tree for the
         'pmip6MIB' MODULE-IDENTITY defined in the PMIPV6-MIB.
