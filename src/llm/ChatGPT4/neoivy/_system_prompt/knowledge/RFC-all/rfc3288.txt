Abstract

   This memo specifies a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) binding to
   the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol core (BEEP).  A SOAP binding
   describes how SOAP messages are transmitted in the network.

   The SOAP is an XML-based (extensible markup language) messaging
   protocol used to implement a wide variety of distributed messaging
   models.  It defines a message format and describes a variety of
   message patterns, including, but not limited to, RPC, asynchronous
   event notification, unacknowledged messages, and forwarding via SOAP
   intermediaries.

1. Introduction

   This memo specifies how SOAP 1.1 envelopes[1] are transmitted using a
   BEEP profile[2].  In the W3C, the XMLP effort is evolving SOAP.
   Accordingly, this memo provides a mechanism for negotiating the use
   of new features.

   Throughout this memo, the term "envelope" refers to the "SOAP-
   Env:Envelope" element defined in Section 4 of [1].  Further, the
   terms "peer", "client", "server", "one-to-one", and "one-to-many" are
   used in the context of BEEP.  In particular, Sections 2.1 and 2.1.1
   of [2] discuss BEEP roles and exchange styles.

2. BEEP Profile Identification

   The BEEP profile for SOAP is identified as

       http://iana.org/beep/soap

   in the BEEP "profile" element during channel creation.

   In BEEP, when the first channel is successfully created, the
   "serverName" attribute in the "start" element identifies the "virtual
   host" associated with the peer acting in the server role, e.g.,

       <start number='1' serverName='stockquoteserver.example.com'>
           <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap' />
       </start>

   The "serverName" attribute is analagous to HTTP's "Host" request-
   header field (c.f., Section 14.23 of [3]).

   There are two states in the BEEP profile for SOAP, "boot" and
   "ready":

   o  In the "boot" state, the peer requesting the creation of the
      channel sends a "bootmsg" (either during channel initialization or
      in a "MSG" message).

      *  If the other peer sends a "bootrpy" (either during channel
         initialization or in a "RPY" message), then the "ready" state
         is entered

      *  Otherwise, the other peer sends an "error" (either during
         channel initialization or in a "ERR" message), then no state
         change occurs.

   o  In the "ready" state, either peer begins a SOAP message pattern by
      sending a "MSG" message containing an envelope.  The other peer
      completes the message pattern either by:

      *  sending back a "RPY" message containing an envelope; or,

      *  sending back zero or more "ANS" messages, each containing an
         envelope, followed by a "NUL" message.

      Regardless, no state change occurs.

2.1 Profile Initialization

   The boot message is used for two purposes:

      resource identification: each channel bound to the BEEP profile
      for SOAP provides access to a single resource (a network data
      object or service).

      feature negotiation: if new features of SOAP (such as compression)
      emerge, their use can be negotiated.

   The DTD syntax for the boot message and its response are:

       <!ELEMENT bootmsg     EMPTY>
       <!ATTLIST bootmsg
                 resource    CDATA             #REQUIRED
                 features    NMTOKENS          "">

       <!ELEMENT bootrpy     EMPTY>
       <!ATTLIST bootrpy
                 features    NMTOKENS          "">

   The boot message contains a mandatory and an optional attribute:

   o  the "resource" attribute, which is analagous to HTTP's "abs_path"
      Request-URI parameter (c.f., Section 5.1.2 of [3]); and,

   o  the "features" attribute, which, if present, contains one or more
      feature tokens, each indicating an optional feature of the BEEP
      profile for SOAP that is being requested for possible use over the
      channel.

   Section 6.1 defines a registration template for optional features.

   If the peer acting in the server role recognizes the requested
   resource, it replies with the boot response that contains one
   optional attribute:

   o  the "features" attribute, if present, contains a subset of the
      feature tokens in the boot message, indicating which features may
      be used over the channel.  (If not present or empty, then no
      features may be used.)

   Otherwise, if the boot message is improperly formed, or if the
   requested resource isn't recognized, the peer acting in the server
   role replies with an error message (c.f., Section 7.1 of [2]).





O'Tuathail & Rose           Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 3288                   Using SOAP in BEEP                  June 2002


   Typically, the boot message and its response are exchanged during
   channel initialization (c.f., Section 2.3.1.2 of [2]).

   For example, here the boot message and its response are exchanged
   during channel initialization:

       C: <start number='1' serverName='stockquoteserver.example.com'>
       C:     <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>
       C:         <![CDATA[<bootmsg resource='/StockQuote' />]]>
       C:     </profile>
       C: </start>

       S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>
       S:     <![CDATA[<bootrpy />]]>
       S: </profile>

   The channel bound to the BEEP profile for SOAP is now in the "ready"
   state.

   Alternatively, here is an example in which the boot exchange is
   unsuccessful:

       C: <start number='1' serverName='stockquoteserver.example.com'>
       C:     <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>
       C:         <![CDATA[<bootmsg resource='/StockPick' />]]>
       C:     </profile>
       C: </start>

       S: <profile uri='http://iana.org/beep/soap'>
       S:     <![CDATA[<error code='550'>resource not
       S:                                supported</error>]]>
       S: </profile>

   Although the channel was created successfully, it remains in the
   "boot" state.

3. SOAP Message Packages

   The BEEP profile for SOAP transmits envelopes encoded as UTF-8 using
   the media type "application/xml"[4], e.g.,

   MSG 1 1 . 0 364
   Content-Type: application/xml

   <SOAP-ENV:Envelope
     xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
     SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
       <SOAP-ENV:Body>
          <m:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:m="Some-URI">
              <symbol>DIS</symbol>
          </m:GetLastTradePrice>
       </SOAP-ENV:Body>
   </SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
   END

RFC 3288                   Using SOAP in BEEP                  June 2002


   In addition, the BEEP profile for SOAP also allows envelopes to be
   transmitted as the root part of a "multipart/related"[5] content, and
   with subordinate parts referenced using the rules of Section 3 of [6]
   (i.e., using either the "Content-ID:"[7] or "Content-Location:"[8]
   headers), e.g.,

   MSG 1 2 . 364 668
   Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="MIME_boundary";
                 type=application/xml;
                 start="<claim061400a.xml@claiming-it.com>"

   --MIME_boundary
   Content-Type: application/xml
   Content-ID: <claim061400a.xml@claiming-it.com>

   <?xml version='1.0' ?>
   <SOAP-ENV:Envelope
     xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <SOAP-ENV:Body>
   ..
   <theSignedForm href="cid:claim061400a.tiff@claiming-it.com" />
   ..
   </SOAP-ENV:Body>
   </SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

   --MIME_boundary
   Content-Type: image/tiff
   Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary
   Content-ID: <claim061400a.tiff@claiming-it.com>

   ...binary TIFF image...
   --MIME_boundary--
   END

   Consistent with Section 2 of [6], it is strongly recommended that the
   multipart contain a "start" parameter, and that the root part contain
   a "Content-ID:" header.  However, because BEEP provides an 8bit-wide
   path, a "transformative" Content-Transfer-Encoding (e.g., "base64" or
   "quoted-printable") should not be used.  Further note that MIME[9]
   requires that the value of the "Content-ID" header be globally
   unique.

4. SOAP Message Patterns

4.1 One-way Message

   A one-way message involves sending a message without any response
   being returned.

   The BEEP profile for SOAP achieves this using a one-to-many exchange,
   in which the client sends a "MSG" message containing an envelope, and
   the server immediately sends back a "NUL" message, before processing
   the contents of the envelope.

4.2 Request-Response Exchange

   A request/response exchange involves sending a request, which results
   in a response being returned.

   The BEEP profile for SOAP achieves this using a one-to-one exchange,
   in which the client sends a "MSG" message containing an envelope, and
   the server sends back a "RPY" message containing an envelope.

   Finally, the BEEP profile for SOAP does not use the "ERR" message for
   SOAP faults when performing one-to-one exchanges -- whatever response
   is generated by the server is always returned in the "RPY" message.

4.3 Request/N-Responses Exchange

   A request/N-responses exchange involves sending a request, which
   results in zero or more responses being returned.

   The BEEP profile for SOAP achieves this using a one-to-many exchange,
   in which the client sends a "MSG" message containing an envelope, and
   the server sends back zero or more "ANS" messages, each containing an
   envelope, followed by a "NUL" message.

RFC 3288                   Using SOAP in BEEP                  June 2002


5. URL Schemes

   This memo defines two URL schemes, "soap.beep" and "soap.beeps",
   which identify the use of SOAP over BEEP over TCP.  Note that, at
   present, a "generic" URL scheme for SOAP is not defined.

5.1 The soap.beep URL Scheme

   The "soap.beep" URL scheme uses the "generic URI" syntax defined in
   Section 3 of [10], specifically:

   o  the value "soap.beep" is used for the scheme component; and,

   o  the server-based naming authority defined in Section 3.2.2 of [10]
      is used for the authority component.

   o  the path component maps to the "resource" component of the boot
      message sent during profile initialization (if absent, it defaults
      to "/").

   The values of both the scheme and authority components are case-
   insensitive.

   For example, the URL

       soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com/StockQuote

   might result in the example shown in Section 2.1.

5.1.1 Resolving IP/TCP Address Information

   The "soap.beep" URL scheme indicates the use of the BEEP profile for
   SOAP running over TCP/IP.

   If the authority component contains a domain name and a port number,
   e.g.,

       soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com:1026

   then the DNS is queried for the A RRs corresponding to the domain
   name, and the port number is used directly.










O'Tuathail & Rose           Standards Track                    [Page 10]

RFC 3288                   Using SOAP in BEEP                  June 2002


   If the authority component contains a domain name and no port number,
   e.g.,

       soap.beep://stockquoteserver.example.com

   the SRV algorithm[11] is used with a service parameter of "soap-beep"
   and a protocol parameter of "tcp" to determine the IP/TCP addressing
   information.  If no appropriate SRV RRs are found (e.g., for "_soap-
   beep._tcp.stockquoteserver.example.com"), then the DNS is queried for
   the A RRs corresponding to the domain name and the port number used
   is assigned by the IANA for the registration in Section 7.4.

   If the authority component contains an IP address, e.g.,

       soap.beep://10.0.0.2:1026

   then the DNS is not queried, and the IP address is used directly.  If
   a port number is present, it is used directly; otherwise, the port
   number used is assigned by the IANA for the registration in Section
   7.4.

   While the use of literal IPv6 addresses in URLs is discouraged, if a
   literal IPv6 address is used in a "soap.beep" URL, it must conform to
   the syntax specified in [12].

5.2 The soap.beeps URL Scheme

   The "soap.beeps" URL scheme is identical, in all ways, to the
   "soap.beep" URL scheme specified in Section 5.1, with the exception
   that prior to starting the BEEP profile for SOAP, the BEEP session
   must be tuned for privacy.  In particular, note that both URL schemes
   use the identical algorithms and parameters for address resolution as
   specified in Section 5.1.1 (e.g., the same service name for SRV
   lookups, the same port number for TCP, and so on).

   There are two ways to perform privacy tuning on a BEEP session,
   either:

   o  a transport security profile may be successfully started; or,

   o  a user authentication profile that supports transport security may
      be successfully started.

   Regardless, upon completion of the negotiation process, a tuning
   reset occurs in which both BEEP peers issue a new greeting.  Consult
   Section 3 of [2] for an example of how a BEEP peer may choose to
   issue different greetings based on whether privacy is in use.

   Although service provisioning is a policy matter, at a minimum, all
   implementations must provide the following tuning profiles:

   for authentication: http://iana.org/beep/SASL/DIGEST-MD5

   for confidentiality: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher)

   for both: http://iana.org/beep/TLS (using the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher supporting client-side
      certificates)

   Further, implementations may choose to offer MIME-based security
   services providing message integrity and confidentiality, such as
   OpenPGP[13] or S/MIME[14].

   Regardless, consult [2]'s Section 9 for a discussion of BEEP-specific
   security issues.

IANA Considerations

   The IANA has registered the profile specified in Section 7.1 as:

         http://iana.org/beep/soap

   The IANA has registered "soap.beep" and "soap.beeps" as URL schemes,
   as specified in Section 7.2 and Section 7.3, respectively.

   The IANA has also registered "SOAP over BEEP" as a TCP port number,
   as specified in Section 7.4.

   Finally, the IANA maintains a list of SOAP profile features, c.f.,
   Section 6.1.  The IESG is responsible for assigning a designated
   expert to review the specification prior to the IANA making the
   assignment.  Prior to contacting the IESG, developers of SOAP profile
   features must use the mailing list beepwg@lists.beepcore.org to
   solicit commentary.
