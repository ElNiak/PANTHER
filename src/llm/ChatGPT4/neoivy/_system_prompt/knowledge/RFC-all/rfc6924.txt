        Registration of Second-Level URN Namespaces under "ietf"

Abstract

   RFC 2648 defines the "ietf" URN namespace and a number of sub-
   namespaces.  RFC 3553 defines an additional sub-namespace, "params",
   and creates a registry to document allocations under that.  But there
   is no registry that lists, in one place, all sub-namespaces of
   "ietf".  This document creates and populates such a registry, thereby
   changing the mechanism defined in RFC 2648 for adding new sub-
   namespaces of "ietf".

1.  Introduction

   "A URN Namespace for IETF Documents" [RFC2648] defines the "ietf" URN
   namespace and a number of sub-namespaces.  "An IETF URN Sub-namespace
   for Registered Protocol Parameters" [RFC3553] defines an additional
   sub-namespace, "params", and creates a registry to document
   allocations under that.  But there is no registry that lists, in one
   place, all sub-namespaces of "ietf".  This document creates and
   populates such a registry, thereby changing the mechanism defined in
   RFC 2648 for adding new sub-namespaces of "ietf".

2.  IANA Considerations

   There is currently a top-level registry group called "IETF Protocol
   Parameter Identifiers", which contains one registry, "IETF URN Sub-
   namespace for Registered Protocol Parameters".  IANA has taken the
   following three actions:

   Action 1: Renamed the group "IETF Protocol Parameter Identifiers",
   giving it the new name "Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace for
   IETF Use".  The existing registry in that group remains, and its name
   is unchanged.  Its registration procedure has been updated to "IETF
   Review" (formerly called "IETF Consensus").

   Action 2: Added a new registry to the renamed group.  The new
   registry is called "IETF URN Sub-namespaces", and new registrations
   will use the IETF Review policy [RFC5226], which provides for IETF
   consensus in order to add a new URN namespace under "ietf".  The new
   registry appears first in the group, to provide a human-friendly,
   top-down resolution of the namespace hierarchy.

   Action 3: Populated the new registry as follows:

   IETF URN Sub-namespaces

   Registration Procedures: IETF Review
   Reference: [RFC6924]

   Note: This is the Official Registry for sub-namespaces of the 'IETF'
   URN Namespace.

3.  Security Considerations

   This is a procedural document and is entirely unrelated to security.

   Alfred Hoenes noticed the absence of this registry and suggested its
   creation.
