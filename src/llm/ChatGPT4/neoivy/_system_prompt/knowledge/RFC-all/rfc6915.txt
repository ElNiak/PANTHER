   Flow Identity Extension for HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD)

Abstract

   RFC 6155 specifies an extension for the HTTP-Enabled Location
   Delivery (HELD) protocol, allowing the use of an IP address and port
   number to request a Device location based on an individual packet
   flow.

   However, certain kinds of NAT require that identifiers for both ends
   of the packet flow must be specified in order to unambiguously
   satisfy the location request.

   This document specifies an XML Schema and a URN Sub-Namespace for a
   Flow Identity Extension for HELD to support this requirement.

   This document updates RFC 6155 by deprecating the port number
   elements specified therein.

RFC 6915                 Flow Identity for HELD               April 2013


1.  Introduction

   Work at the Emergency Location Task Group of NICC Standards Limited
   (the UK's telecoms industry standards body) prompted the addition of
   port number identifiers in HELD Identity [RFC6155] to allow HELD
   [RFC5985] requests for Devices that are behind NAT devices.

   Subsequent analysis has determined that in the presence of particular
   types of NAT devices, and in particular Carrier Grade NATs, it is
   necessary to know the complete tuple of (Layer 3 protocol, Layer 4
   protocol, source address, source port, destination address,
   destination port) in order to unambiguously identify a flow, and
   subsequently the true Device.

   This document specifies an XML Schema and a URN Sub-Namespace for a
   Flow Identity Extension to support this requirement and provides a
   more generally applicable means of identifying a Device based on the
   parameters of a network flow of which it is an endpoint.

   Since the Location Recipient may not know in advance whether the
   Device is behind a NAT device, the port number elements from Section
   3.3 of [RFC6155] are deprecated and MUST NOT be used in new client
   implementations.  Note that server implementations of this
   specification may still encounter requests formed by clients that
   have implemented only [RFC6155], and those requests might contain the
   deprecated port element.

   For implementation details not specified in this document, please
   refer to [RFC6155] and [RFC5985].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms "Device" and "Target" are used as defined in [RFC6280].

3.  Usage

   An example HELD request is shown below:

   <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"
                         responseTime="8">
     <locationType exact="true">geodetic</locationType>
     <flow xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:flow"
       layer4="tcp" layer3="ipv4">
       <src>
         <address>192.0.2.25</address>
         <port>1024</port>
       </src>
       <dst>
         <address>198.51.100.238</address>
         <port>80</port>
       </dst>
     </flow>
   </locationRequest>

   The <flow> element MUST contain:

   o  a "layer3" attribute with a value of "ipv4" or "ipv6".

   o  a "layer4" attribute with a value of "udp" [RFC0768], "tcp"
      [RFC0793], "sctp" [RFC4960], "dccp" [RFC4340], or a decimal
      integer representing any applicable protocol from the IANA
      Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers Registry.

   o  an <src> element and a <dst> element whose child elements contain
      the Layer 3 address (which MUST conform to the relevant
      "IPv4address" or "IPv6address" grammar as defined in [RFC3986])
      and the Layer 4 port number of each end of the flow.

   and MAY optionally contain:

   o  a "target" attribute with a value of "src" (default) or "dst" to
      indicate which end of the flow corresponds to the Target of the
      <locationRequest> with respect to the HELD protocol.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  URN Sub-Namespace Registration for
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:flow

   This section registers a new XML namespace,
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:flow", as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

   END

5.2.  XML Schema Registration

   This section registers an XML Schema as per the guidelines in
   [RFC3688].

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held:flow

   Registrant Contact: IETF GEOPRIV Working Group (geopriv@ietf.org),

   Schema: The XML for this schema can be found as the entirety of
   Section 4 of this document.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   All of the considerations in [RFC6155] apply to the use of the
   mechanism defined in this document.  Like [RFC6155], this
   specification assumes that the Location Server being queried already
   has access to the internal state of the network near one end of the
   flow being queried (for instance, access to the bindings in a NAT in
   the path of the flow).  Clients making queries using this
   specification in environments where that assumption may not be true
   should be aware that the request provides information about that
   client's communications that the Location Server would not otherwise
   be able to discern and may represent additional privacy exposure for
   that client.
