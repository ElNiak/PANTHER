                           Identification MIB

Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies an IAB standards track protocol for the Internet
   community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.
   Please refer to the current edition of the "IAB Official Protocol
   Standards" for the standardization state and status of this protocol.
   Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines a MIB for use with identifying the users associated
   with TCP connections.  It provides functionality approximately
   equivalent to that provided by the protocol defined in RFC 1413 [1].
   This document is a product of the TCP Client Identity Protocol
   Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

1.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      STD 16/RFC 1155 [2] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  STD
      16/RFC 1212 [3] defines a more concise description mechanism,
      which is wholly consistent with the SMI.

      STD 17/RFC 1213 [4] which defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
      objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      STD 15/RFC 1157 [5] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for
      network access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Within a given MIB module,
   objects are defined using RFC 1212's OBJECT-TYPE macro.  At a
   minimum, each object has a name, a syntax, an access-level, and an
   implementation-status.

   The name is an object identifier, an administratively assigned name,
   which specifies an object type.  The object type together with an
   object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation
   of the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
   termed the object descriptor, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 [6] language is used
   for this purpose.  However, RFC 1155 purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The access-level of an object type defines whether it makes "protocol
   sense" to read and/or write the value of an instance of the object
   type.  (This access-level is independent of any administrative
   authorization policy.)

   The implementation-status of an object type indicates whether the
   object is mandatory, optional, obsolete, or deprecated.

2.  Identification MIB

   The Identification MIB defines a uniform set of objects useful for
   identifying users associated with TCP connections.  End-systems which
   support TCP may, at their option, implement this MIB.  However,
   administrators should read Section 4 ("Security Considerations")
   before enabling these MIB objects.

4.  Security Considerations

   The information available through this MIB is at most as trustworthy
   as the host providing it OR the organization operating the host.  For
   example, a PC in an open lab has few if any controls on it to prevent
   a user from having an SNMP query return any identifier the user
   wants.  Likewise, if the host has been compromised the information
   returned may be completely erroneous and misleading.

   This portion of the MIB space should only be used to gain hints as to
   who "owns" a particular TCP connection -- information returned should
   NOT be considered authoritative for at least the reasons described
   above.  At best, this MIB provides some additional auditing
   information with respect to TCP connections.  At worse it can provide
   misleading, incorrect or maliciously incorrect information.

   The use of the information contained in this MIB for other than
   auditing or normal network management functions is strongly
   discouraged.  Specifically, using information from this MIB space to
   make access control decisions - either as the primary method (i.e.,
   no other checks) or as an adjunct to other methods may result in a
   weakening of normal system security.

   This MIB provides access to information about users, entities,
   objects or processes which some systems might normally consider
   private.  The information accessible through this MIB is a rough
   analog of the CallerID services provided by some phone companies and
   many of the same privacy consideration and arguments that apply to
   CallerID service apply to this MIB space.  If you wouldn't run a
   "finger" server [7] due to privacy considerations, you might not want
   to provide access to this MIB space on a general basis.  Access to
   this portion of the MIB tree may be controlled under the normal
   methods available through SNMP agent implementations.
