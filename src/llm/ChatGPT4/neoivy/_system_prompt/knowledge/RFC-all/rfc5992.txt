     Internationalized Domain Names Registration and Administration
            Guidelines for European Languages Using Cyrillic

Abstract

   This document is a guideline for registries and registrars on
   registering internationalized domain names (IDNs) based on (in
   alphabetical order) Bosnian, Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Kildin Sami,
   Macedonian, Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian, and Ukrainian languages in
   a DNS zone.  It describes appropriate characters for registration and
   variant considerations for characters from Greek and Latin scripts
   with similar appearances and/or derivations.

1.  Introduction

   Cyrillic is one of a fairly small number of scripts that are used,
   with different subsets of characters, to write a large number of
   languages, some of which are not closely related to the others.  When
   those languages might be used together in a zone (typical of generic
   TLDs (gTLDs) but likely in other zones both at and below the root),
   special considerations for intermixing characters may apply.
   Cyrillic also has the property that, while it is usually considered a
   separate script from the Latin (Roman) and Greek ones, it shares many
   characters with them, creating opportunities for visual confusion.
   Those difficulties are especially pronounced when "all of Cyrillic"
   is used rather than only the characters associated with a particular
   language.

   This specification provides guidelines for the use of Cyrillic, as
   encoded in Unicode [Unicode52] with internationalized domain name
   (IDN) labels derived from most "European" languages that use the
   script (use of the term "European" is a convenience, since there is
   disagreement about the relevant boundaries for different purposes
   and, of course, much of Russia lies within geological Asia).
   Specifically, it covers (in alphabetic order) Bosnian, Bulgarian,



Sharikov, et al.              Informational                     [Page 2]

   Byelorussian, the Kildin member of the Sami (often written "Saami")
   language family, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Russian, Serbian, and
   Ukrainian.  Supplemental tables, based on information in the Unicode
   Standard and a recently completed Montenegrin government standard
   [MontenegrinChars] are provided for use with Montenegrin.  Moldovan
   is no longer in official use with Cyrillic script: no registrations
   are considered likely in Cyrillic, at least within the relevant
   ccTLD, and it is not further discussed in this document.  Languages
   of Asia that use Cyrillic are not considered here and should be the
   subject of separate specifications.

   While Cyrillic script is the primary one used for many of the
   relevant languages and countries, Latin script is often used instead
   of, or in combination with, it.  Standard keyboards used in most of
   the countries have both Cyrillic and Latin characters.  Therefore,
   some registries could use Latin scripts for domain name registration
   in their zones.  From time to time, some registries and users have
   claimed that there is a requirement for mixing Cyrillic and Latin
   characters in the same label.  We strongly recommend against such
   mixing as user confusion is almost certain to result.  In addition,
   registries that support many scripts will probably encounter the need
   to support labels in Greek or Latin scripts as well as Cyrillic, and
   a large number of character forms are shared among those three
   scripts.

   Because the DNS has no way for the end user to distinguish among the
   languages that might have been used to inspire a particular label, it
   seems useful to treat the characters of a large number of languages
   that use Cyrillic in their writing systems together, rather than
   trying to differentiate them.  The discussion and tables in this
   specification should provide a foundation for developing more
   restrictive rules for zones in which only a single language is likely
   to be used, but it does not specify those language-specific rules.

   Readers of this document should be aware that its recommendations are
   about use in DNS labels.  The orthography for some of the languages
   involved, especially Kildin Sami, is not completely standardized and
   local usage sometimes permits substitution of Latin-based characters
   for their Cyrillic equivalents.  Unless they are required by official
   orthographies, those substitutions should generally be avoided in DNS
   labels because of the risk of additional user confusion with the
   Latin characters that are visually similar.

1.1.  Similar Characters and Variants

   For some human languages, there are characters and/or strings that
   have equivalent or near-equivalent meanings.  If someone is allowed
   to register a name with such a character or string, the registry



Sharikov, et al.              Informational                     [Page 3]

RFC 5992                      Cyrillic IDNs                 October 2010


   might want to automatically register all the names that have the same
   meaning in that language.  Further, some registries might want to
   restrict the set of characters to be registered for language-based
   reasons.

   So-called "variant techniques", introduced in the JET specification
   for the CJK script [RFC3743] and its generalization [RFC4290],
   describe ways of registering IDNs to decrease the risk of
   misunderstandings, cybersquatting, and other forms of confusion.

   The tables below (Appendix A) identify confusable characters in Latin
   and Greek scripts that might be easily confused with Cyrillic ones.

   As with variant approaches for other scripts (e.g., see RFC 4713
   [RFC4713] for the Chinese language or RFC 5564 [RFC5564] for the
   Arabic language), this document identifies sets of characters that
   need special consideration and provides information about them.  A
   registry that handles names using these characters can then make a
   policy decision about how to actually handle them.  The options for
   those policy decisions would include automatically registering all
   look-alike strings to the same registrant, registering one such
   string and blocking the others, and so on.

1.2.  Terminology

   The terminology that follows is derived from the JET specification
   for the CJK script [RFC3743] and its generalization [RFC4290], but
   this specification does not depend on them.  All characters listed
   here have been verified to be "PVALID" under the IDNA2008
   specification [RFC5890] [RFC5892].

   A "string" is a sequence of one or more characters.

   This document discusses characters that have equivalent or near-
   equivalent characters or strings.  The "base character" is the
   character that has one or more equivalents; the "variant(s)" are the
   character(s) and/or string(s) that are equivalent to the base
   character.

   A "registration bundle" is the set of all labels that comes from
   expanding all base characters for a single name into their variants.

   A registry is the administrative authority for a DNS zone.  That is,
   the registry is the body that makes and enforces policies that are
   used in a particular zone in the DNS.  The term "registry" applies to
   all zones in the DNS, not only those that exist at the top level.

2.  Languages and Characters

   In the interest of clarity and balance, this document describes a
   "Base Cyrillic" set of 23 characters for use in comparing the
   character usage for Russian and Central European languages that use
   Cyrillic.  The balance of this section compares the character usage
   of the individual languages in that group.

   "Base Cyrillic" consists of the following Unicode code points (names
   associated with these code points and those below appear in
   Appendix A): U+0430, U+0431, U+0432, U+0433, U+0434, U+0435, U+0436,
   U+0437, U+043A, U+043B, U+043C, U+043D, U+043E, U+043F, U+0440,
   U+0441, U+0442, U+0443, U+0444, U+0445, U+0446, U+0447, U+0448.

   In addition, modern writing systems that use Cyrillic do not have
   digits separate from the "European" ones used with Latin characters.
   For registries that permit digits to appear in domain name labels,
   the "Base Cyrillic" code point listed above should be considered to
   include U+0030, U+0031, U+0032, U+0033, U+0034, U+0035, U+0036,
   U+0037, U+0038, and U+0039 (Digit Zero, and Digit One through Digit
   Nine).  The Hyphen-Minus character (U+002D) may also be used.

   It is worth noting that the EU top-level domain registry allows
   Cyrillic registrations using 32 code points [EU-registry].  That list
   is sufficient for some of the languages listed here but not for
   others.

   The individual languages that are the focus of this specification are
   discussed below (in English alphabetical order).

2.1.  Bosnian and Serbian

   Bosnian and Serbian have 30 letters in the alphabet and the
   additional seven characters to the base of 23 shared Cyrillic
   characters: U+0438, U+0458, U+0452, U+0459, U+045A, U+045B, U+045F.

2.2.  Bulgarian

   The Bulgarian alphabet has 30 characters, seven in addition to the
   basic 23: U+0438, U+0439, U+0449, U+044A, U+044C, U+044E, U+044F.

2.3.  Byelorussian (Belarusian, Belarusan)

   The Byelorussian (now often spelled Belarusian or Belarusan) alphabet
   has 32 characters, i.e., nine characters in addition to the Base
   Cyrillic set of 23 characters: U+0451, U+0456, U+0439, U+044B,
   U+044C, U+045E, U+044D, U+044E, U+044F.

RFC 5992                      Cyrillic IDNs                 October 2010


2.4.  Kildin Sami

   The phonetics of the Kildin Sami are quite complex and not easily
   represented in Cyrillic (see, e.g., Kertom's work [Kert]).  The
   orthography is not standardized and the writing system may best be
   thought of as an attempt to transcribe the language phonetically
   (primary in Latin script in the 1930s but in Cyrillic more recently).
   Different scholars have reported different numbers of phonemes,
   further complicating the transcription process.  Kertom identifies 53
   consonants with long-short distinctions and, in many cases, hard-soft
   ones.  He also identifies ascending and descending diphthongs and one
   triphthong as well as more common short and long vowels.

   The primary reference for Kildin Sami, widely circulated for some
   time but only in draft, is apparently used by Sami language(s)
   experts in Scandinavian countries [Riessl07].  It, and the references
   it cites, uses 56 characters, 33 of which do not appear in the basic
   set.  Eight* of these characters have no precomposed forms in Unicode
   and hence must be written as a sequence of two code points with the
   second one being COMBINING MACRON (U+0304).  Using parentheses to
   make the two-code-point sequences more obvious, the additional
   characters are: (U+0430 U+0304)*, (U+0435 U+0304)*, U+0438, U+0439,
   (U+043E U+0304), U+044A, U+044B, (U+044B U+0304), U+044C, U+044D,
   (U+044D U+0304), U+044E, (U+044E U+0304), U+044F, (U+044F U+0304),
   U+0451, (U+0451 U+0304), U+0458, U+048B, U+048D, U+048F, U+04BB,
   U+04C6, U+04C8, U+04CA, U+04CE, U+04D3, U+04E3, U+04E7, U+04ED,
   U+04EF, U+04F1, U+04F9.

   *  These characters, CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER A (U+0430) with a
      COMBINING MACRON (U+0304) and CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER IE (U+0435)
      with a COMBINING MACRON (U+0304), respectively, have the same
      visual appearance as LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH MACRON (U+0101) and
      LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH MACRON (U+0113).  There are no known
      keyboards designed specifically for Kildin Sami.  If an extended
      Latin-based keyboard and associated software are used, these
      characters might appear with the code point based on Latin (e.g.,
      U+0113 for the second case).  By contrast, keyboards and input
      software that are designed to be more Cyrillic-friendly are more
      likely to produce code points for the Cyrillic base characters.
      The use of a Latin character base for that second case occurs in
      some Western European sources including Riessler's work
      [Riessl07].  While we have not found explicit substitutions for A
      with Macron, we believe they might be found in practice.  These
      alternatives are not mapped together by Unicode Normalization Form
      C (NFC) (or Normalization Form KC (NFKC)), so registries, and
      possibly applications software, should exercise some care about





Sharikov, et al.              Informational                     [Page 6]

RFC 5992                      Cyrillic IDNs                 October 2010


      these coding variations.  However, U+0101 and U+0113 are Latin
      Script characters so, if either is used, any tests on homogeneity
      of the script within a label need to be made with care.

      Similar issues may apply to other Kildin Sami characters
      constructed with combining sequences.

   The key references in Russian ([Anto90], [Kert86], [Kuru85]) all
   propose slightly different character tables relative to each other
   and to Riessler's list.  Because the latter list appears to be more
   comprehensive and to represent more recent scholarship, we have based
   the tables in this document on it.  We recommend, however, that
   registries review these recommendations and the relevant papers
   should registration requests for Kildin Sami actually appear.

   Additional perspectives on Kildin Sami can be found on the Omniglot
   Sami pages [OmniglotSaami].

2.5.  Macedonian

   Macedonian has 31 characters in the alphabet.  This is eight in
   addition to the basic set: U+0438, U+0458, U+0452, U+0459, U+045A,
   U+045C, U+045F, U+0491, U+0455.

2.6.  Montenegrin

   According to the most recent, and now final, government specification
   [MontenegrinChars], Montenegrin has 32 characters in its alphabet,
   including two that have no precomposed forms in Unicode.  This is
   nine in addition to the basic set and two in addition to Bosnian and
   Serbian: U+0437 U+0301, U+0438, U+0441 U+0301, U+0452, U+0458,
   U+0459, U+045A, U+045B, U+045F.

   See Bosnian, Section 2.1, above.

2.7.  Russian

   The current Russian alphabet has 33 characters, consisting of the
   Base Cyrillic set plus an additional ten characters: U+0451, U+0438,
   U+0439, U+0449, U+044A, U+044B, U+044C, U+044D, U+044E, U+044F.

2.8.  Serbian

   See Bosnian, Section 2.1, above.

RFC 5992                      Cyrillic IDNs                 October 2010


2.9.  Ukrainian

   The character list for modern Ukrainian has apparently not completely
   stabilized.  Some references claim 31 characters and therefore an
   additional 8 characters to the Base Cyrillic set of 23.  Others claim
   33, adding U+0438 and U+0439 and replacing U+044A (Hard Sign) with
   U+044C (Soft Sign), for a total of an additional 11 characters as
   compared to the Base Cyrillic set.  Unless better information is
   available, the prudent registry should probably assume that all 34
   characters are in use, i.e., the Base Cyrillic set plus U+0438,
   U+0439, U+0454, U+0456, U+0457, U+0491, U+0449, U+044A, U+044C,
   U+044E, U+044F.

3.  Language-Based Tables

   The registration strategy described in this document uses a table
   that lists all characters allowed for input and any variants of those
   characters.  Note that the table lists all characters allowed, not
   only the ones that have variants.

4.  Table Processing Rules

   The input to the process is called the "input label".  The output of
   the process is either failure (the input label cannot be registered
   at all), or a registration bundle that contains one or more labels in
   A-label form.

5.  Table Format

   The table in Appendix A consists of four columns.  The first and
   second identify the Cyrillic character, and the third and fourth
   identify Latin or Greek characters that might be easily confused with
   them visually.  If both a Latin and Greek character are present, the
   Greek one appears in the third and fourth columns on the subsequent
   line (with "..." in the first column to indicate more information
   about the character specified on the previous line).  Variants needed
   only because of case folding are shown with "+++" in the first
   column, as noted in the table.

   Each character in the table is given in the "U+" notation for Unicode
   characters followed, in the next column, by its name as shown in the
   Unicode Standard.  For easy reference, the characters are listed in
   the order in which they appear in the Unicode Standard.

   The table does not, and any future revision MUST NOT, have more than
   one entry for a particular base character.

6.  Steps after Registering an Input Label

   A registry has at least three policy options for handling the cases
   where the registration bundle has more than one label.  These
   options, and their key implications, are:

   o  Allocate all labels to the same registrant, making the zone
      information identical to that of the input label.

      This option will cause end users to be able to find names with
      variants more easily, but will result in larger zone files.  In
      principle, the zone file could become so large that it could
      negatively affect the ability of the registry to perform name
      resolution.

   o  Block all labels so they cannot be registered in the future.

      This option does not increase the size of the zone file, but it
      may cause end users to not be able to find names with variants
      that they would expect.

   o  Allocate some labels and block some other labels.

      This option is likely to cause the most confusion with users
      because including some variants will cause a name to be found, but
      using other variants will cause the name to be not found.

   With any of these three options, the registry MUST keep a database
   that links each label in the registration bundle to the input label.
   This link needs to be maintained so that changes in the non-DNS
   registration information (such as the label's owner name and address)
   are reflected in every member of the registration bundle as well.

7.  Security Considerations

   The information provided in this document may assist DNS zone
   administrators and registrants in selecting names that are less
   likely to be confused with others and in adopting policies that help
   avoid confusion.  It may also assist user-interface designers in
   identifying possible areas of confusion so that they can better
   protect users.  The document otherwise has no consequences for the
   security of the Internet.

   ([Anto90], [Kert86], and [Kuru85]) and partial translations from
   them.  We are grateful for their efforts that facilitated treating it
   nearly the same way as other actively used European languages that
   use Cyrillic script.

   Careful reading of late drafts of this document by Bill McQuillan,
   Alexey Melnikov, and Peter Saint-Andre, identified a number of
   editorial problems, some of which might not have been caught
   otherwise.

Appendix A.  European Cyrillic Character Tables

   These tables are constructed on the basis of the characters that can
   actually occur in the DNS, i.e., those that are valid in U-labels as
   defined in RFC 5890.  If the characters that can be mapped into those
   characters are to be considered instead, then the number of variants
   would increase considerably.  For example, while CYRILLIC SMALL
   LETTER A (U+0430) and GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA (U+03B1) are readily
   distinguished visually, their capital letter equivalents are not, so,
   if case mappings such as those discussed in the IDNA2008 Mapping
   document [RFC5895] are considered, the two small letters must be
   considered variants of each other.  Some of the variants have been
   selected on the assumption that unusual fonts may be used and that
   users will see what they expect to see; others, involving subtle
   decorations but considered more far-fetched out of context, have not
   been listed.

   These additional, possibly required, variants are shown below with
   "+++" in the first column of the table.

   "..." in the first column is used to indicate more information about
   the character specified on the previous line.
