                Reclassification of RFC 3525 to Historic

Status of This Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
   memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document reclassifies RFC 3525, Gateway Control Protocol Version
   1, to Historic Status.  This memo also obsoletes RFC 3525.

1.  Introduction

   The purpose of this document is to reclassify RFC 3525, Gateway
   Control Protocol Version 1, to Historic Status.

2.  Reclassification of RFC 3525 to Historic

   The protocol defined by RFC 3525 [RFC3525] was developed jointly by
   the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU-T Study Group 16.  The ITU-T
   published ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1 (originally H.248) with the
   same contents as RFC 3525.  Since that initial development, the ITU-T
   has taken ownership of the protocol and has continued to work on it.
   The protocol as originally defined in RFC 3525 underwent a series of
   corrections and clarifications.  H.248.1 version 1 [h248v1] was
   republished in March, 2002, incorporating all changes agreed upon up
   to that date.  Since then, further corrections have been agreed upon.
   The accumulated set of corrections to H.248.1 (03/2002) is available
   in the Implementors' Guide for Recommendation H.248.1 Version 1 (03/
   2002) ("Media Gateway Control Protocol") [impgdv1], which is
   available at no charge on the ITU-T web site.

   RFC 3525 has been rendered even more obsolete as a specification of
   the Megaco/H.248 protocol by the publication of further versions of
   ITU-T Recommendation H.248.1.  Version 2 [h248v2] was published in
   May, 2002, and is the version most widely deployed at present.  It is
   also the version that other standards bodies such as 3GPP are
   currently using as the basis for their own profile specifications.
   Version 3 [h248v3] was published more recently, in September, 2005.

   In short, RFC 3525 may serve as an introduction to the Megaco/H.248
   protocol, but it is misleading as a description of the protocol as
   currently standardized or deployed.  It is appropriate to reclassify
   RFC 3525 to Historic status, as described in RFC 2026 [RFC2026].

3.  Security Considerations

   Reclassifying RFC 3525 has no security implications.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any new actions by the IANA.  The IANA
   registries established by RFC 3525 and extended by successive
   versions of ITU-T H.248.1 remain in force, along with the requirement
   for expert review by an IESG-designated expert.
