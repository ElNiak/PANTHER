         SEPTEMBER, 1974, SURVEY OF NEW-PROTOCOL TELNET SERVERS


LAST MONTH'S SURVEY PRODUCED A GRATIFYING AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK CLARIFYING
THE STATUS OF SEVERAL SITES; HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW CHANGES IN
THE STATUS OF HOST SERVERS.  THE CHANGES IN THIS MONTH'S LIST, IN
NUMERICAL ORDER (HOST NUMBER THROUGHOUT ARE OCTAL):

UCLA-NMC IS NO LONGER A SERVER;
HOST 205 IS NOW BBN-TENEXD, A NEW SYSTEM (BBNB) IS NOW HOST 61;
RAND-RCC WAS ACCIDENTALLY OMITTED FROM THE PREVIOUS LIST;
SDC-LAB HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY ELIMINATED FROM THE LIST UNTIL IT RETURNS
    TO THE NET;
I4-TENEXA (117) IS NOT A SERVER--KI4B-TENEX (217) IS, AND HAS BEEN ADDED
    TO THE LIST;
AMES-67 FIXED A BUG, REVEALING TO THE WORLD THE NEW-PROTOCOL SERVER (NO
    OPTIONS) THAT WAS THERE ALL ALONG;
ISI-DEVTENEX (226) AND USC-ECL (327) HAVE BEEN ADDED.

WHAT FOLLOWS IS AN UPDATE OF THE SUMMARY AND TABULATION THAT APPEARED
LAST MONTH.*  THERE IS STILL A LONG WAY TO GO TO 100% NEW-PROTOCOL
IMPLEMENTATION.

        TOTAL SERVER HOSTS            34             100%
        NO NEW-PROT SERVER            21              62%
        TOTAL NEW-PROT IMPLEM.        13              38%
          NEW-PROT ON SOCKET 27,
          OLD ON SOCKET 1 (2)          6              18%
          NEW-PROT ON 1 AND 27 (3)     6              18%
          NEW-PROT ON 1 ONLY           1               3%

NOTES:
*   ALL DATA IN THIS REPORT WERE GATHERED VIA A SURVEYING PROGRAM RUN AT
    VARIOUS TIMES, PLUS A FEW MANUAL CHECKS TO FILL OUT THE DATA.  WHAT
    IS REPORTED HERE IS THE WAY THE VARIOUS SERVERS WORK AS SEEN BY THE
    NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNET AT BBNA, AS OF 23 SEPT. 1974.
(2) THESE ARE THE SITES WHOSE OPERATION IS 100% CORRECT ACCORDING TO ALL
    PROTOCOL AND CONVENTIONS, AS I UNDERSTAND THEM.
(3) WE REALIZE THAT SOME OF THE SERVERS THAT APPEAR HERE AS NEW-PROTOCOL
    SERVERS ON SOCKET 1 ARE ACTUALLY SERVERS WHICH ATTEMPT TO
    COMMUNICATE WITH BOTH OLD- AND NEW-PROTOCOL USER TELNETS ACCORDING
    TO WHAT CONTROL SEQUENCES ARE RECEIVED.
