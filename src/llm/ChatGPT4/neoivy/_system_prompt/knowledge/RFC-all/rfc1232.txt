1.  Abstract

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, this memo defines MIB objects

RFC 1232                 DS1 Interface Objects                  May 1991


   for representing DS1 physical interfaces.  Implementors should
   consult in addition to this memo the companion document that
   describes that DS3 managed objects.

2.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      RFC 1155 which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for describing
      and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC 1212
      defines a more concise description mechanism, which is wholly
      consistent with the SMI.

      RFC 1156 which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects for
      the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213, defines MIB-II, an
      evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and new
      operational requirements.

      RFC 1157 which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
      access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

3.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7]
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object has a name, a syntax,
   and an encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an
   administratively assigned name, which specifies an object type.  The
   object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the OBJECT
   DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI [3] purposely restricts the ASN.1
   constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are explicitly made
   for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.

RFC 1232                 DS1 Interface Objects                  May 1991


   The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 [8],
   subject to the additional requirements imposed by the SNMP.

3.1.  Format of Definitions

   Section 5 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in [13].

4.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS1 physical interface.  At present, this
   applies to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-
   standard MIB:

               ds1 (18)
               e1  (19)

   The definitions contained herein are based on the AT&T T-1
   specifications and Extended Superframe (ESF) format [9, 10], the
   latter of which conforms to proposed ANSI specifications [14, 15].
   The various T1 and E1 line disciplines are similar enough that
   separate MIBs are unwarranted, although there are some differences.
   For example, Loss of Frame is defined more rigorously in the ESF
   specification than in the D4 specification, but it is defined in
   both.

4.1.  Binding between Interfaces and CSUs

   It should be noted that it is possible to multiplex multiple bit
   streams onto a single DS1 physical interface (CSU), realizing
   multiple interfaces from the perspective of the Internet-standard
   MIB.  It is also possible to concatenate physical interfaces to
   provide a single logical interface.  As such, it is important to be
   able to distinguish between the indices used to identify the CSUs
   attached to a node and the indices used to identify an interface (in
   the MIB sense) attached to a node.

   Each agent which resides on a host which uses DS1 physical interfaces
   is required to assign a small, positive integer uniquely to each CSU.
   This is known as the "CSUIndex", and is used to distinguish between
   different CSUs attached to a node.  The CSUIndex is also used as the
   "key" when accessing tabular information about DS1 physical
   interfaces.

   The potentially many-to-one binding between CSU indices and the

RFC 1232                 DS1 Interface Objects                  May 1991


   ifIndex value assigned to each MIB interface are defined in the
   ds1ConfigTable table defined in the next section.

4.2.  Objectives of this MIB Module

   There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS1
   Interfaces: the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of
   CSUs, both in-chassis and external via proxy.  As such, a design
   decision was made up front to very closely align the MIB with the set
   of objects that can generally be read from CSUs that are currently
   deployed, which is to say ESF CSUs conforming to AT&T specifications.
   However, by simple generalization of these objects, the MIB is also
   made applicable to D4 and G.704 devices.

   To meet a requirement not easily satisfied in other places, there is
   one additional group present, the Fractional DS1 group.  This is
   intended to facilitate the use of fractional DS1 devices (i.e.,
   devices which utilize a subset of the 8 bit channels available in the
   frame) over the managed CSUs.

4.3.  DS1 Terminology

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a T1 or E1 circuit monitored by a CSU are from references [10], [11],
   [14], and [15].

          Out of Frame event
               An Out of Frame event is declared when the receiver
               detects two or more framing-bit errors within a 3
               millisecond period, or two or more errors out of five or
               less consecutive framing-bits.  At this time, the framer
               enters the Out of Frame State, and starts searching for a
               correct framing pattern.  The Out of Frame state ends
               when reframe occurs.

          Loss of Signal
               This event is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75
               contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either
               positive or negative polarity (also called keep alive).

          Code Violation Error Event
               A Code Violation Error Event is the occurrence of a
               received Cyclic Redundancy Check code that is not
               identical to the corresponding locally-calculated code.

          Bipolar Violation
               A Bipolar Violation, for B8ZS-coded signals, is the



Transmission MIB Working Group                                  [Page 4]

RFC 1232                 DS1 Interface Objects                  May 1991


               occurrence of a received bipolar violation that is not
               part of a zero-substitution code.  It also includes other
               error patterns such as: eight or more consecutive zeros
               and incorrect parity.

          Errored Seconds
               An Errored Second is a second with one or more Code
               Violation Error Events OR one or more Out of Frame
               events.  In D4 and G.704 section 2.1.3.2 (eg, G.704 which
               does not implement the CRC), the presence of Bipolar
               Violations also triggers an Errored Second.

          Severely Errored Seconds
               A Severely Errored Second is a second with 320 or more
               Code Violation Error Events OR one or more Out of Frame
               events.

          Severely Errored Framing Second
               An Severely Errored Framing Second is a second with one
               or more Out of Frame events.

          Unavailable Signal State
               This state is declared at the onset of 10 consecutive
               Severely Errored Seconds.  It is cleared at the onset of
               10 consecutive seconds with no Severely Errored Second.

          Unavailable Seconds
               Unavailable Seconds are calculated by counting the number
               of seconds that the CSU is in the Unavailable Signal
               State, including the initial 10 seconds to enter the
               state but not including the 10 seconds to exit the state.

               Note that any second that may be counted as an
               Unavailable Second may not be counted as an Errored
               Second, a Severely Errored Second.  Since the 10 Severely
               Errored Seconds that comprise the transition from the
               available to Unavailable Signal State may also be counted
               as Errored Seconds, and Severely Errored Seconds previous
               to entering the state, these three counters are adjusted
               so that any second counted during this transition is then
               subtracted.  The 10 seconds in the transition from
               unavailable to available may be counted as Errored
               Seconds.

               A special case exists when the 10 or more second period
               crosses the 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
               foregoing description implies that the Severely Errored
               Second and Unavailable Second counters must be adjusted

               when the Unavailable Signal State is entered.  Clearly,
               successive GETs of the affected ds1IntervalSES and
               ds1IntervalUAS objects will return differing values if
               the first GET occurs during the first few seconds of the
               window.  This is viewed as an unavoidable side-effect of
               selecting the presently deployed AT&T objects as a basis
               for this memo.

          Yellow Alarm
               A Yellow Alarm is declared because of an incoming Yellow
               Signal from the far-end.  In effect, the circuit is
               declared to be a one way link.

          Red Alarm
               A Red Alarm is declared because of an incoming Loss of
               Signal, Loss of Framing, Alarm Indication Signal.  After
               a Red Alarm is declared, the device sends a Yellow Signal
               to the far-end.  The far-end, when receives the Yellow
               Signal, declares a Yellow Alarm.

          Circuit Identifier
               This is a character string specified by the circuit
               vendor, and is useful when communicating with the vendor
               during the troubleshooting process.

                      ds1JammedBit refers the Jammed bit Zero Encoding,
                      in which the AT&T specification of at least one
                      pulse every 8 bit periods is literally implemented

                      by forcing a pulse in bit 8 of each channel.
                      Thus, only seven bits per channel, or 1.344 Mbps,
                      is available for data.

                      ds1B8ZS refers to the use of a specified pattern
                      of normal bits and bipolar violations which are
                      used to replace a sequence of eight zero bits (see
                      [14]).  In this context, all eight bits in a
                      channel are technically available for data, but
                      care must be taken with D4 encoded data to avoid
                      having HDLC Flag streams imitate spurious Yellow
                      Alarm conditions.  Typically, one bit per frame is
                      ignored to force flag streams to rotate, thereby
                      avoiding this error type.  CCITT Recommendation
                      G.703 [11] may be referred to for further
                      definition of these.

                      ds1InvertedHDLC refers to the practice, common on
                      HDLC encoded DS1 data links, of inverting the data
                      between the serial interface chip and the CSU.
                      Since HDLC guarantees one zero every 6 bits in the
                      worst case, while the standards call for (in
                      effect) at least one pulse every eight, inverted
                      HDLC enjoys 4/24 one's density on the line, which
                      may improve the effective clock stability of a DS1
                      line.  As with B8ZS, all eight bits in a channel
                      are technically available for data, but care must
                      be taken with D4 encoded data to avoid having HDLC
                      Flag streams imitate spurious Yellow Alarm
                      conditions.  Typically, one bit per frame is
                      ignored to force flag streams to rotate, thereby
                      avoiding this error type.

                      ANSI Clear Channels may use ds1ZBTSI, or Zero Byte
                      Time Slot Interchange (see [14]).

                      G.704 links, with or without CRC, use ds1HDB3 (see
                      [11]).  "

          -- systems utilizing a fractional DS1 capability


          -- The DS1 fractional table contains identifies which DS1
          -- channels associated with a CSU are being used to support a
          -- logical interface, i.e., an entry in the interfaces table
          -- from the Internet-standard MIB.  For Clear Channel
          -- implementations, exactly one ifTable entry corresponds to
          -- the CSU being managed.  In this very typical case, the
          -- variable ds1Index indicates the value of ifIndex which
          -- corresponds to the interface being supported by a
          -- particular CSU.

          -- However, for fractional DS1 implementations, the
          -- correspondent value of ds1Index is 0, and for each DS1
          -- channel supporting a logical interface, there is an entry
          -- in the DS1 fractional table which names a value for
          -- ifIndex.
          --
          --      For ds1ESF, ds1D4, and ds1ANSI-ESF, there are 24 legal
          --      channels, numbered 1 through 24.
          --
          --      For G.704, there are 32 legal channels, numbered 1
          --      through 32.  ds1G704 can carry user data in channels 2
          --      through 32, channel 1 being an overhead channel.
          --      ds1G704-CRC can carry user data in channels 2 through
          --      16 and 18 through 32, channels 1 and 17 being overhead
