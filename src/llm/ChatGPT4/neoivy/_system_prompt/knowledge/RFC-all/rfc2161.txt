1.  Introduction

   This document contains the definitions, originally contained in RFC
   1495 and RFC 1341, on how to carry ODA in MIME, and how to translate
   it to its X.400 representation.

1.1.  The Application/ODA MIME content-type

   The "ODA" subtype of application is used to indicate that  a body
   contains  information  encoded according to the Office Document
   Architecture  [ODA]   standards,  using  the  ODIF representation
   format.   For  application/oda, the Content-Type line should also
   specify an attribute/value  pair  that indicates  the document
   application profile (DAP), using the key word "profile", and the
   document class, using the keyword "class".

   For the keyword "class", the values "formatted", "processable" and
   "formatted-processable" are legal values.

   Thus an appropriate header field  might look like this:

   Content-Type:  application/oda; profile=Q112; class=formatted

   Consult the ODA standard [T.411] for further information.

   The Base64 content-transfer-encoding is appropriate for carrying ODA.


1.2.  ODA - application/oda

   X.400 Body Part: ODA
   MIME Content-Type: application/oda
   Conversion: None
   Comments:

   The ODA body part is defined in the CCITT document T.411 [T.411],
   appendix E, section E.2, "ODA identification in the P2 protocol of
   MHS"

   An abbreviated version of its ASN.1 definition is:

    oda-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
            PARAMETERS      OdaBodyPartParameters
            DATA            OdaData
            ::= id-et-oda

    OdaBodyPartParameters ::= SET {
            document-application-profile    [0] OBJECT IDENTIFIER
            document-architecture-class     [1] INTEGER {
                                            formatted (0)
                                            processable (1)
                                            formatted-processable(2)}}

    id-et-oda OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { 2 8 1 0 1 }

   Mapping from X.400 to MIME, the following is done:

   The Parameters.document-application-profile is mapped onto the MIME
   parameter "profile" according to the table below.

   Profile         OBJECT IDENTIFIER

   Q112            { iso (1) identified-organization (3) ewos (16)
                     eg (2) oda (6) profile (0)  q112 (1) }

RFC 2161                A MIME Body Part for ODA            January 1998


   The Parameters.document-architecture-class is mapped onto the MIME
   parameter "class" according to the table below.

   String                  Integer

   formatted               formatted(0)
   processable             processable(1)
   formatted-processable   formatted-processable(2)

   NOTE: This parameter is not defined in RFC 1341.

   The body of the MIME content-type is the Data part of the ODA body
   part.

   When mapping from MIME to X.400, the following steps are done:

   The Parameters.document-application-profile and Parameters.document-
   architecture-class are set from the tables above.  If any of the
   parameters are missing, the values for Q112 and formatted-processable
   are used.

   It is an option for the gateway implementor to try to access them
   from inside the document, where they are defined as

   document-profile.document-characteristics.document-architecture-class

   document-profile.document-characteristics.document-application-
   profile

   Gateways are NOT required to do this, since the document-
   characteristics are optional parameters.  If a gateway does not, it
   simply uses the defaulting rules defined above.

   The OBJECT IDENTIFIERs for the document application profile and for
   ODA {2 8 0 0} must be added to the Encoded Information Types
   parameter of the message envelope.

2.  Security Considerations

   ODA body parts have the natural propensity of complex structures that
   it is hard to find out what the parts are capable of.

   Moreover, ODA is an extensible architecture, where new content
   portions may be added at any time, so that the threats posed by this
   body part may change over time.

   However, no security risks related to ODA are known at this time.
