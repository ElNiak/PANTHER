Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing DS3 and E3
   interfaces.  This document is a companion document with Definitions
   of Managed Objects for the DS0 (RFC 2494 [25]), DS1/E1/DS2/E2 (RFC
   2495 [17]), and the work in progress SONET/SDH Interface Types.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC
        1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and
        RFC 2274 [12].

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
        store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects
        in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.
        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
        A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the
        appropriate translations. The resulting translated MIB must be
        semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are
        omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).

        Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted
        into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
        process. However, this loss of machine readable information is
        not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

1.1.  Changes from RFC1407

   This MIB obsoletes RFC1407.  The changes from RFC1407 are the
   following:

        (1)  The Fractional Table has been deprecated

        (2)  This document uses SMIv2

        (3)  Values are given for ifTable and ifXTable

        (4)  Example usage of ifStackTable is included

        (5)  dsx3IfIndex has been deprecated

        (6)  The definition of valid intervals has been clarified
             for the case where the agent proxied for other devices.  In
             particular, the treatment of missing intervals has been
             clarified.

        (7)  An inward loopback has been added.

        (8)  Additional lineStatus bits have been added for Near End
             in Unavailable Signal State, Carrier Equipment Out of
             Service, DS@ Payload AIS, and DS@ Performance Threshold

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


        (9)  A read-write line Length object has been added.

        (10) Added a lineStatus last change, trap and enabler.

        (11) Textual Conventions for statistics objects have
             been used.

        (12) A new object, dsx3LoopbackStatus, has been introduced to
             reflect the loopbacks established on a DS3/E3 interface and
             the source to the requests.  dsx3LoopbackConfig continues
             to be the desired loopback state while dsx3LoopbackStatus
             reflects the actual state.

        (13) A dual loopback has been added to allow the setting of an
             inward loopback and a line loopback at the same time.

        (14) An object has been added to indicated whether or not this
             is a channelized DS3/E3.

        (15) A new object has been added to indicate which DS1 is to set
             for remote loopback.

2.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS3/E3 interface.  At present, this applies
   to these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

        ds3 (30)

   The DS3 definitions contained herein are based on the DS3
   specifications in ANSI T1.102-1987, ANSI T1.107-1988, ANSI T1.107a-
   1990, and ANSI T1.404-1989 [8,9,9a,10].  The E3 definitions contained
   herein are based on the E3 specifications in CCITT G.751 [12].

2.1.  Use of ifTable for DS3 Layer

   Only the ifGeneralGroup needs to be supported.

                             If no Circuit Identifier has been assigned
                             this object should have an octet string
                             with zero length.

                              cases such as DS3/E3 over AAL1/ATM where
                              false(2) is appropriate

2.2.  Usage Guidelines

2.2.1.  Usage of ifStackTable

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

           ifIndex  Description
           1        Ethernet
           2        Line#A Router
           3        Line#B Router



Fowler, Ed.                 Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


           4        Line#C Router
           5        Line#D Router
           6        Line#A CSU Router
           7        Line#B CSU Router
           8        Line#C CSU Router
           9        Line#D CSU Router
           10       Line#A CSU Network
           11       Line#B CSU Network
           12       Line#C CSU Network
           13       Line#D CSU Network

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various DS3 interfaces.

           ifStackTable Entries

           HigherLayer   LowerLayer
           2             6
           3             7
           4             8
           5             9
           6             10
           7             11
           8             12
           9             13

   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent, the
   situation would be identical, except the Ethernet and the 4 router
   interfaces are deleted.  Interfaces would also be numbered from 1 to
   8.

           ifIndex  Description
           1        Line#A CSU Router
           2        Line#B CSU Router
           3        Line#C CSU Router
           4        Line#D CSU Router
           5        Line#A CSU Network
           6        Line#B CSU Network
           7        Line#C CSU Network

2.2.2.  Usage of Channelization for DS3, DS1, DS0

   An example is given here to explain the channelization objects in the
   DS3, DS1, and DS0 MIBs to help the implementor use the objects
   correctly. Treatment of E3 and E1 would be similar, with the number
   of DS0s being different depending on the framing of the E1.

   Assume that a DS3 (with ifIndex 1) is Channelized into DS1s (without
   DS2s).  The object dsx3Channelization is set to enabledDs1.  When
   this object is set to enabledDS1, 28 ifEntries of type DS1 will be
   created by the agent. If dsx3Channelization is set to disabled, then
   the DS1s are destroyed.

   Assume the entries in the ifTable for the DS1s are created in channel
   order and the ifIndex values are 2 through 29. In the DS1 MIB, there
   will be an entry in the dsx1ChanMappingTable for each ds1.  The
   entries will be as follows:

        dsx1ChanMappingTable Entries

        ifIndex  dsx1Ds1ChannelNumber   dsx1ChanMappedIfIndex

        1        1                      2
        1        2                      3
        ......
        1        28                     29

   In addition, the DS1s are channelized into DS0s.  The object
   dsx1Channelization is set to enabledDS0 for each DS1.  There will be
   24 DS0s in the ifTable for each DS1.  Assume the entries in the
   ifTable are created in channel order and the ifIndex values for the
   DS0s in the first DS1 are 30 through 53.  In the DS0 MIB, there will
   be an entry in the dsx0ChanMappingTable for each DS0.  The entries
   will be as follows:

        dsx0ChanMappingTable Entries

        ifIndex   dsx0Ds0ChannelNumber  dsx0ChanMappedIfIndex
        2         1                     30
        2         2                     31
        ......
        2         24                    53

2.2.3.  Usage of Channelization for DS3, DS2, DS1

   An example is given here to explain the channelization objects in the
   DS3 and DS1 MIBs to help the implementor use the objects correctly.




Fowler, Ed.                 Standards Track                     [Page 7]

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


   Assume that a DS3 (with ifIndex 1) is Channelized into DS2s.  The
   object dsx3Channelization is set to enabledDs2.  There will be 7 DS2s
   (ifType of DS1) in the ifTable.  Assume the entries in the ifTable
   for the DS2s are created in channel order and the ifIndex values are
   2 through 8. In the DS1 MIB, there will be an entry in the
   dsx1ChanMappingTable for each DS2.  The entries will be as follows:

        dsx1ChanMappingTable Entries

        ifIndex  dsx1Ds1ChannelNumber   dsx1ChanMappedIfIndex
        1        1                      2
        1        2                      3
        ......
        1        7                      8

   In addition, the DS2s are channelized into DS1s.  The object
   dsx1Channelization is set to enabledDS1 for each DS2.  There will be
   4 DS1s in the ifTable for each DS2.  Assume the entries in the
   ifTable are created in channel order and the ifIndex values for the
   DS1s in the first DS2 are 9 through 12, then 13 through 16 for the
   second DS2, and so on.  In the DS1 MIB, there will be an entry in the
   dsx1ChanMappingTable for each DS1.  The entries will be as follows:

        dsx1ChanMappingTable Entries

        ifIndex   dsx1Ds1ChannelNumber  dsx1ChanMappedIfIndex
        2         1                     9
        2         2                     10
        2         3                     11
        2         4                     12
        3         1                     13
        3         2                     14
        ...
        8         4                     36

2.2.4.  Usage of Loopbacks

   This section discusses the behaviour of objects related to loopbacks.

   The object dsx3LoopbackConfig represents the desired state of
   loopbacks on this interface.  Using this object a Manager can
   request:
       LineLoopback
       PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)
       InwardLoopback
       DualLoopback (Line + Inward)
       NoLoopback




Fowler, Ed.                 Standards Track                     [Page 8]

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


   The remote end can also request lookbacks either through the FDL
   channel if ESF or inband if D4.  The loopbacks that can be request
   this way are:
   LineLoopback
   PayloadLoopback (if ESF framing)
   NoLoopback

   To model the current state of loopbacks on a DS3 interface, the
   object dsx3LoopbackStatus defines which loopback is currently applies
   to an interface.  This objects, which is a bitmap, will have bits
   turned on which reflect the currently active loopbacks on the
   interface as well as the source of those loopbacks.

   The following restrictions/rules apply to loopbacks:

   The far end cannot undo loopbacks set by a manager.

   A manager can undo loopbacks set by the far end.

   Both a line loopback and an inward loopback can be set at the same
   time.  Only these two loopbacks can co-exist and either one may be
   set by the manager or the far end.  A LineLoopback request from the
   far end is incremental to an existing Inward loopback established by
   a manager.  When a NoLoopback is received from the far end in this
   case, the InwardLoopback remains in place.

2.3.  Objectives of this MIB Module

   There are numerous things that could be included in a MIB for DS3/E3
   signals:  the management of multiplexors, CSUs, DSUs, and the like.
   The intent of this document is to facilitate the common management of
   all devices with DS3/E3 interfaces.  As such, a design decision was
   made up front to very closely align the MIB with the set of objects
   that can generally be read from DS3/E3 devices that are currently
   deployed.

2.4.  DS3/E3 Terminology

   The terminology used in this document to describe error conditions on
   a DS3 interface as monitored by a DS3 device are based on the late
   but not final draft of what became the ANSI T1.231 standard [11].  If
   the definition in this document does not match the definition in the
   ANSI T1.231 document, the implementer should follow the definition

2.4.1.  Error Events

     Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error Event
          A bipolar violation error event, for B3ZS(HDB3)-coded signals,
          is the occurrence of a pulse of the same polarity as the
          previous pulse without being part of the zero substitution
          code, B3ZS(HDB3).  For B3ZS(HDB3)-coded signals, a bipolar
          violation error event may also include other error patterns
          such as:  three(four) or more consecutive zeros and incorrect
          polarity. (See T1.231 section 7.1.1.1.1)

     Excessive Zeros (EXZ) Error Event
          An EXZ is the occurrence of any zero string length equal to or
          greater than 3 for B3ZS, or greater than 4 for HDB3.  (See
          T1.231 section 7.1.1.1.2)

     Line Coding Violation (LCV) Error Event
          This parameter is a count of both BPVs and EXZs occurring over
          the accumulation period.  An EXZ increments the LCV by one
          regardless of the length of the zero string. (Also known as
          CV-L.  See T1.231 section 7.4.1.1)

     P-bit Coding Violation (PCV) Error Event
          For all DS3 applications, a coding violation error event is a
          P-bit Parity Error event.  A P-bit Parity Error event is the
          occurrence of a received P-bit code on the DS3 M-frame that is
          not identical to the corresponding locally- calculated code.
          (See T1.231 section 7.1.1.2.1)

     C-bit Coding Violation (CCV) Error Event
          For C-bit Parity and SYNTRAN DS3 applications, this is the
          count of coding violations reported via the C-bits.  For C-bit
          Parity, it is a count of CP-bit parity errors occurring in the
          accumulation interval.  For SYNTRAN, it is a count of CRC-9
          errors occurring in the accumulation interval. (See T1.231
          section 7.1.1.2.2)

2.4.2.  Performance Parameters

   All performance parameters are accumulated in fifteen minute
   intervals and up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) are kept by an
   agent.  Fewer than 96 intervals of data will be available if the
   agent has been restarted within the last 24 hours.  In addition,
   there is a rolling 24-hour total of each performance parameter.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

   Performance parameters are of types PerfCurrentCount,
   PerfIntervalCount and PerfTotalCount.  These textual conventions are
   all Gauge32, and they are used because it is possible for these
   objects to decrease.  Objects may decrease when Unavailable Seconds
   occurs across a fifteen minutes interval boundary. See Unavailable
   Seconds discussion later in this section.

     Line Errored Seconds (LES)
          A Line Errored Second is a second in which one or more CV
          occurred OR one or more LOS defects.  (Also known as ES-L. See
          T1.231 section 7.4.1.2)

     P-bit Errored Seconds (PES)
          An PES is a second with one or more PCVs OR one or more Out of
          Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS. This gauge is not
          incremented when UASs are counted.  (Also known as ESP-P. See
          T1.231 section 7.4.2.2)

     P-bit Severely Errored Seconds (PSES)
          A PSES is a second with 44 or more PCVs OR one or more Out of
          Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS. This gauge is not
          incremented when UASs are counted.  (Also known as SESP-P. See
          T1.231 section 7.4.2.5)

     C-bit Errored Seconds (CES)
          An CES is a second with one or more CCVs OR one or more Out of
          Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.  This count is only
          for the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3 applications. This gauge
          is not incremented when UASs are counted. (Also known as
          ESCP-P. See T1.231 section 7.4.2.2)

     C-bit Severely Errored Seconds (CSES)
          A CSES is a second with 44 or more CCVs OR one or more Out of
          Frame defects OR a detected incoming AIS.  This count is only
          for the SYNTRAN and C-bit Parity DS3 applications.  This gauge
          is not incremented when UASs are counted. (Also known as
          SESCP-P. See T1.231 section 7.4.2.5)

     Severely Errored Framing Seconds (SEFS)
          A SEFS is a second with one or more Out of Frame defects OR a
          detected incoming AIS. This item is not incremented during
          unavailable seconds.  (Also known as SAS-P. See T1.231 section
          7.4.2.6)

     Unavailable Seconds (UAS)
          UAS are calculated by counting the number of seconds that the
          interface is unavailable.  The DS3 interface is said to be
          unavailable from the onset of 10 contiguous PSESs, or the
          onset of the condition leading to a failure (see Failure
          States).  If the condition leading to the failure was
          immediately preceded by one or more contiguous PSESs, then the
          DS3 interface unavailability starts from the onset of these
          PSESs.  Once unavailable, and if no failure is present, the
          DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous
          seconds with no PSESs.  Once unavailable, and if a failure is
          present, the DS3 interface becomes available at the onset of
          10 contiguous seconds with no PSESs, if the failure clearing
          time is less than or equal to 10 seconds.  If the failure
          clearing time is more than 10 seconds, the DS3 interface
          becomes available at the onset of 10 contiguous seconds with
          no PSESs, or the onset period leading to the successful
          clearing condition, whichever occurs later. With respect to
          the DS3 error counts, all counters are incremented while the
          DS3 interface is deemed available.  While the interface is
          deemed unavailable, the only count that is incremented is
          UASs.

          Note that this definition implies that the agent cannot
          determine until after a ten second interval has passed whether
          a given one-second interval belongs to available or
          unavailable time.  If the agent chooses to update the various
          performance statistics in real time then it must be prepared
          to retroactively reduce the PES, PSES, CES, and CSES counts by
          10 and increase the UAS count by 10 when it determines that
          available time has been entered.  It must also be prepared to
          adjust the PCV, CCV, and SEFS count as necessary since these
          parameters are not accumulated during unavailable time.  It
          must be similarly prepared to retroactively decrease the UAS
          count by 10 and increase the PES, CES, PCV, and CCV counts as
          necessary upon entering available time.  A special case exists
          when the 10 second period leading to available or unavailable
          time crosses a 900 second statistics window boundary, as the
          foregoing description implies that the PCV, CCV, PES, CES,
          PSES, CSEC, SEFS, and UAS counts for the PREVIOUS interval
          must be adjusted.  In this case successive GETs of the
          affected dsx3IntervalPSESs and dsx3IntervalUASs objects will
          return differing values if the first GET occurs during the
          first few seconds of the window.

          The agent may instead choose to delay updates to the various
          statistics by 10 seconds in order to avoid retroactive
          adjustments to the counters.  A way to do this is sketched in
          Appendix B.

          In any case, a linkDown trap shall be sent only after the
          agent has determined for certain that the unavailable state
          has been entered, but the time on the trap will be that of the
          first UAS (i.e., 10 seconds earlier).  A linkUp trap shall be
          handled similarly.

          According to ANSI T1.231 unavailable time begins at the
          _onset_ of 10 contiguous severely errored seconds -- that is,
          unavailable time starts with the _first_ of the 10 contiguous
          SESs.  Also, while an interface is deemed unavailable all
          counters for that interface are frozen except for the UAS
          count.  It follows that an implementation which strictly
          complies with this standard must _not_ increment any counters
          other than the UAS count -- even temporarily -- as a result of
          anything that happens during those 10 seconds.  Since changes
          in the signal state lag the data to which they apply by 10
          seconds, an ANSI-compliant implementation must pass the the
          one-second statistics through a 10-second delay line prior to
          updating any counters.  That can be done by performing the
          following steps at the end of each one second interval.

   i)   Read near/far end CV counter and alarm status flags from the
        hardware.

   ii)  Accumulate the CV counts for the preceding second and compare
        them to the ES and SES threshold for the layer in question.
        Update the signal state and shift the one-second CV counts and
        ES/SES flags into the 10-element delay line.  Note that far-end
        one-second statistics are to be flagged as "absent" during any
        second in which there is an incoming defect at the layer in
        question or at any lower layer.

   iii) Update the current interval statistics using the signal state
        from the _previous_ update cycle and the one-second CV counts
        and ES/SES flags shifted out of the 10-element delay line.

   This approach is further described in Appendix B.

2.4.3.  Performance Defects

     Failure States:
          The Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) failure, in SYNTRAN
          applications, is declared after detecting the Yellow Alarm



Fowler, Ed.                 Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


          Signal on the alarm channel.  See ANSI T1.107a-1990 [9a]. The
          Remote Alarm Indication failure, in C-bit Parity DS3
          applications, is declared as soon as the presence of either
          one or two alarm signals are detected on the Far End Alarm
          Channel.  See [9].  The Remote Alarm Indication failure may
          also be declared after detecting the far-end SEF/AIS defect
          (aka yellow).  The Remote Alarm Indication failure is cleared
          as soon as the presence of the any of the above alarms are
          removed.

          Also, the incoming failure state is declared when a defect
          persists for at least 2-10 seconds.  The defects are the
          following:  Loss of Signal (LOS), an Out of Frame (OOF) or an
          incoming Alarm Indication Signal (AIS).  The Failure State is
          cleared when the defect is absent for less than or equal to 20
          seconds.

     Far End SEF/AIS defect (aka yellow)
          A Far End SEF/AIS defect is the occurrence of the two X-bits
          in a M-frame set to zero.  The Far End SEF/AIS defect is
          terminated when the two X-bits in a M-frame are set to one.
          (Also known as SASCP-PFE. See T1.231 section 7.4.4.2.6)

     Out of Frame (OOF) defect
          A DS3 OOF defect is detected when any three or more errors in
          sixteen or fewer consecutive F-bits occur within a DS3 M-
          frame.  An OOF defect may also be called a Severely Errored
          Frame (SEF) defect.  An OOF defect is cleared when reframe
          occurs.  A DS3 Loss of Frame (LOF) failure is declared when
          the DS3 OOF defect is consistent for 2 to 10 seconds.  The DS3
          OOF defect ends when reframe occurs.  The DS3 LOF failure is
          cleared when the DS3 OOF defect is absent for 10 to 20
          seconds. (See T1.231 section 7.1.2.2.1)

          An E3 OOF defect is detected when four consecutive frame
          alignment signals have been incorrectly received in there
          predicted positions in an E3 signal. E3 frame alignment occurs
          when the presence of three consecutive frame alignment signals
          have been detected.

     Loss of Signal (LOS) defect
          The DS3 LOS defect is declared upon observing 175 +/- 75
          contiguous pulse positions with no pulses of either positive
          or negative polarity.  The DS3 LOS defect is terminated upon
          observing an average pulse density of at least 33% over a
          period of 175 +/- 75 contiguous pulse positions starting with
          the receipt of a pulse. (See T1.231 section 7.1.2.1.1)

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


     Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) defect
          The DS3 AIS is framed with "stuck stuffing."  This implies
          that it has a valid M-subframe alignments bits, M-frame
          alignment bits, and P bits.  The information bits are set to a
          1010... sequence, starting with a one (1) after each M-
          subframe alignment bit, M-frame alignment bit, X bit, P bit,
          and C bit.  The C bits are all set to zero giving what is
          called "stuck stuffing."  The X bits are set to one. The DS3
          AIS defect is declared after DS3 AIS is present in contiguous
          M-frames for a time equal to or greater than T, where 0.2 ms
          <= T <= 100 ms.  The DS3 AIS defect is terminated after AIS is
          absent in contiguous M-frames for a time equal to or greater
          than T.  (See T1.231 section 7.1.2.2.3)

          The E3 binary content of the AIS is nominally a continuous
          stream of ones.  AIS detection and the application of
          consequent actions, should be completed within a time limit of
          1 ms.

2.4.4.  Other Terms

     Circuit Identifier
          This is a character string specified by the circuit vendor,
          and is useful when communicating with the vendor during the
          troubleshooting process.

     Proxy
          In this document, the word proxy is meant to indicate an
          application which receives SNMP messages and replies to them
          on behalf of the devices which implement the actual DS3/E3
          interfaces.  The proxy may have already collected the
          information about the DS3/E3 interfaces into its local
          database and may not necessarily forward the requests to the
          actual DS3/E3 interface.  It is expected in such an
          application that there are periods of time where the proxy is
          not communicating with the DS3/E3 interfaces.  In these
          instances the proxy will not necessarily have up-to-date
          configuration information and will most likely have missed the
          collection of some statistics data.  Missed statistics data
          collection will result in invalid data in the interval table.

                 ifStackTable.

                 Implementation of this table was optional.  It was
                 designed for those systems dividing a DS3/E3 into
                 channels containing different data streams that
                 are of local interest.

                 The DS3/E3 fractional table identifies which
                 DS3/E3 channels associated with a CSU are being
                 used to support a logical interface, i.e., an
                 entry in the interfaces table from the Internet-
                 standard MIB.

                 For example, consider a DS3 device with 4 high
                 speed links carrying router traffic, a feed for
                 voice, a feed for video, and a synchronous channel
                 for a non-routed protocol.  We might describe the
                 allocation of channels, in the dsx3FracTable, as
                 follows:
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 1 = 3  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.15 = 4
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 2 = 3  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.16 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 3 = 3  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.17 = 6

                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 5 = 3  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.19 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 6 = 3  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.20 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 7 = 4  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.21 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 8 = 4  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.22 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2. 9 = 4  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.23 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.10 = 4  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.24 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.11 = 4  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.25 = 6
                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.12 = 5  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.26 = 6

                 dsx3FracIfIndex.2.14 = 5  dsx3FracIfIndex.2.28 = 6
                 For dsx3M23, dsx3 SYNTRAN, dsx3CbitParity, and
                 dsx3ClearChannel  there are 28 legal channels,
                 numbered 1 throug h 28.

                 For e3Framed there are 16 legal channels, numbered
                 1 through 16.  The channels (1..16) correspond

4.  Appendix A - Use of dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex

   This Appendix exists to document the previous use if dsx3IfIndex and
   dsx3LineIndex and to clarify the relationship of dsx3LineIndex as
   defined in rfc1407 with the dsx3LineIndex as defined in this
   document.

   The following shows the old and new definitions and the relationship:

   [New Definition]: "This object should be made equal to ifIndex.  The
   next paragraph describes its previous usage.  Making the object equal
   to ifIndex allows proper use of ifStackTable.

   [Old Definition]: "this object is the identifier of a DS3/E3
   Interface on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is
   directly associated with this and only this DS3/E3 interface, it
   should have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the
   dsx3LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules of
   choosing a number that is greater than ifNumber and numbering the
   inside interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and
   outside interfaces (e.g, network side) with odd numbers."

   When the "Old Definition" was created, my understanding was that it
   was described this way to allow a manager to treat the value _as if_
   it were and ifIndex, i.e. the value would either be:  1) an ifIndex
   value or 2) a value that was guaranteed to be different from all
   valid ifIndex values.

   The new definition is a subset of that definition, i.e. the value is
   always an ifIndex value.

   The following is Section 3.1 from rfc1407:

   Different physical configurations for the support of SNMP with DS3/E3
   equipment exist. To accommodate these scenarios, two different
   indices for DS3/E3 interfaces are introduced in this MIB.  These
   indices are dsx3IfIndex and dsx3LineIndex.

   External interface scenario: the SNMP Agent represents all managed
   DS3/E3 lines as external interfaces (for example, an Agent residing
   on the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces directly):

   For this scenario, all interfaces are assigned an integer value equal
   to ifIndex, and the following applies:

      ifIndex=dsx3IfIndex=dsx3LineIndex for all interfaces.

RFC 2496                      DS3/E3 MIB                    January 1999


   The dsx3IfIndex column of the DS3/E3 Configuration table relates each
   DS3/E3 interface to its corresponding interface (ifIndex) in the
   Internet-standard MIB (MIB-II STD 17, RFC1213).

   External&Internal interface scenario: the SNMP Agents resides on an
   host external from the device supporting DS3/E3 interfaces (e.g., a
   router). The Agent represents both the host and the DS3/E3 device.
   The index dsx3LineIndex is used to not only represent the DS3/E3
   interfaces external from the host/DS3/E3-device combination, but also
   the DS3/E3 interfaces connecting the host and the DS3/E3 device.  The
   index dsx3IfIndex is always equal to ifIndex.

   Example:

   A shelf full of CSUs connected to a Router. An SNMP Agent residing on
   the router proxies for itself and the CSU. The router has also an
   Ethernet interface:

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

           ifIndex (= dsx3IfIndex)                     dsx3LineIndex

                   1                   NA                  NA (Ethernet)
                   2      Line#A   Router Side             6
                   2      Line#A   Network Side            7
                   3      Line#B   Router Side             8
                   3      Line#B   Network Side            9
                   4      Line#C   Router Side            10
                   4      Line#C   Network Side           11
                   5      Line#D   Router Side            12
                   5      Line#D   Network Side           13

   For this example, ifNumber is equal to 5.  Note the following
   description of dsx3LineIndex:  the dsx3LineIndex identifies a DS3/E3
   Interface on a managed device.  If there is an ifEntry that is
   directly associated with this and only this DS3/E3 interface, it
   should have the same value as ifIndex.  Otherwise, number the
   dsx3LineIndices with an unique identifier following the rules of
   choosing a number greater than ifNumber and numbering inside
   interfaces (e.g., equipment side) with even numbers and outside
   interfaces (e.g, network side) with odd numbers.

   If the CSU shelf is managed by itself by a local SNMP Agent, the
   situation would be:

           ifIndex (= dsx3IfIndex)                      dsx3LineIndex

                   1      Line#A     Network Side            1
                   2      Line#A     RouterSide              2
                   3      Line#B     Network Side            3
                   4      Line#B     RouterSide              4
                   5      Line#C     Network Side            5
                   6      Line#C     Router Side             6

5.  Appendix B - The delay approach to Unavialable Seconds.

   This procedure is illustrated below for a DS3 C-Bit parity
   application.  Similar rules would apply for other interfaces covered
   by this MIB.  The procedure guarantees that the statistical counters
   are correctly updated at all times, although they lag real time by 10
   seconds.  At the end of each 15 minutes interval the current interval
   counts are transferred to the  most recent interval entry and each
   interval is shifted up by one position, with the oldest being
   discarded if necessary in order to make room.  The current interval
   counts then start over from zero.  Note, however, that the signal
   state calculation does not start afresh at each interval boundary;
   rather, signal state information is retained across interval
   boundaries.

   Note that if such a procedure is adopted there is no current interval
   data for the first ten seconds after a system comes up.
   noSuchInstance must be returned if a management station attempts to
   access the current interval counters during this time.

   It is an implementation-specific matter whether an agent assumes that
   the initial state of the interface is available or unavailable.

9.  Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

   Setting any of the following objects to an inappropriate value can
   cause loss of traffic.  The definition of inappropriate varies for
   each object.  In the case of dsx3LineType, for example, both ends of
   a ds3/e3 must have the same value in order for traffic to flow.  In
   the case of dsx3SendCode and dsx3LoopbackConfig, for another example,
   traffic may stop transmitting when particular loopbacks are applied.
