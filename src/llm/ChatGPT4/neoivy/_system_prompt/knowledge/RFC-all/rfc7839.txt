RFC 7839            ANI Options for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6          June 2016


1.  Introduction

   Access-network identification of a network device has a range of
   applications.  For example, the Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a
   Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain is able to provide service
   treatment for the mobile node's traffic based on the access network
   to which the mobile node is attached.

   This document specifies the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for
   IPv4 (DHCPv4) [RFC2131] and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
   for IPv6 (DHCPv6) [RFC3315] options for access-network identification
   that is added by the relay agent in the DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 messages
   sent towards the server.  The scope of applicability for this option
   is between a DHCP relay agent and a mobile access gateway where the
   same operator typically operates both these functions

   A DHCP relay agent that is aware of the access network and access
   operator adds this information in the DHCP messages.  This
   information can be used to provide differentiated services and
   policing of traffic based on the access network to which a client is
   attached.  Examples of how this information can be used in mobile
   networks can be found in [RFC6757].

2.  Motivation

   PMIPv6 [RFC5213] can be used for supporting network-based mobility
   management in various types of network deployments.  The network
   architectures, such as service provider Wi-Fi access aggregation or
   WLAN integrated mobile packet core, are examples where PMIPv6 is a
   component of the overall architecture.  Some of these architectures
   require the ability of the LMA [RFC5213] to provide differentiated
   services and policing of traffic to the mobile nodes based on the
   access network to which they are attached.  Policy systems in
   mobility architectures, such as Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
   [TS23203] and Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF)
   [TS23402] in the 3GPP system, allow configuration of policy rules
   with conditions based on the access-network information.  For
   example, the service treatment for the mobile node's traffic may be
   different when they are attached to an access network owned by the
   home operator than when owned by a roaming partner.  In the case of
   access networks based on IEEE 802.11, the service treatment can also
   be different based on the configured Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs).
   Other examples of services include the operator's ability to apply
   tariff based on the location.

   The PMIPv6 extension as specified in [RFC6757] defines PMIPv6 options
   to carry Access-Network Identifiers in PMIPv6 signaling from the
   Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to the LMA.  The MAG can learn this

   information from the DHCP options as inserted by the DHCP relay agent
   in the access network.  If the MAG relays the DHCP messages to the
   LMA as specified in [RFC5844], this information can be inserted by
   the MAG towards the LMA in the forwarded DHCP messages.

   Figure 1 illustrates an example of PMIPv6 deployment.  In this
   example, the access network is based on IEEE 802.11 technology, the
   DHCP relay agent function is located on the Access Point (AP), and
   the DHCP server function is located on the MAG.  The MAG delivers the
   information elements related to the access network to the LMA over
   PMIPv6 signaling messages.  The MAG obtains these information
   elements from the DHCP relay agent as per this specification.  The
   information elements related to the access network include the SSID
   of the used IEEE 802.11 network, the geo-location of the access
   network to which the mobile node is attached, and the identity of the
   operator running the IEEE 802.11 access-network infrastructure.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All the DHCP-related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in DHCPv4 [RFC2131] and DHCPv6 [RFC3315]
   specifications.  "DHCP message" refers to both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
   messages throughout this document.

   All the mobility-related terms used in this document are to be
   interpreted as defined in the PMIPv6 specifications [RFC5213] and
   [RFC5844].  Additionally, this document uses the following
   abbreviations:

   Service Set Identifier (SSID)

      The Service Set Identifier (SSID) identifies the name of the IEEE
      802.11 network.  The SSID differentiates from one network to the
      other.

   Operator-Identifier

      The Operator-Identifier is the Structure of Management Information
      (SMI) Network Management Private Enterprise Code of the IANA-
      maintained "Private Enterprise Numbers" registry [SMI].  It
      identifies the operator running the access network where the
      client is attached.

4.  DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Option

   The Access-Network Identifier (ANI) carries information related to
   the identity of the access network to which the client is attached.
   This information includes access-technology type, network identifier,
   and access network operator identifiers.

   Relay agents that include ANI information include one or more sub-
   options (see Section 4.1) in the Relay Agent Information option
   [RFC3046].

4.1.  DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Sub-options

   The Access-Network-Identifier information will be defined in multiple
   sub-options allocated from the "DHCP Relay Agent Sub-Option Codes"
   registry.

   ANI Sub-options: The ANI sub-options consist of a sequence of Sub-
   Option Code, Length, and Value tuples for each sub-option, encoded in
   the following manner:

       Subopt  Len     Sub-option Data
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+
      | code |   N  |  s1  |  s2  |  s3  |  s4  |      |  sN  |
      +------+------+------+------+------+------+--...-+------+

   Subopt code
      The 1-octet code for the sub-options defined in the following
      sections.

   Len
      An unsigned 8-bit integer giving the length of the Sub-option Data
      field in this sub-option in octets.

   Sub-option Data (s1 to sN)
      The data area for the sub-option.

   The initial assignment of the DHCP Access-Network-Identifier sub-
   options is as follows:

      +=========================================================+

4.2.  DHCPv4 Access-Technology-Type Sub-option

   This sub-option is used for exchanging the type of the access
   technology of the network to which the client is attached.  Its
   format is as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3

   Access-Technology-Type (ATT)
      An 8-bit field that specifies the access technology through which
      the client is connected to the access link from the IANA name
      space "Access Technology Type Option type values" registry defined
      in [RFC5213].

4.3.  DHCPv4 Network-Identifier Sub-options

   These sub-options are used for carrying the name of the access
   network (e.g., an SSID in the case of an IEEE 802.11 access network
   or a Public Land-based Mobile Network (PLMN) Identifier [TS23003] in
   the case of a 3GPP access network) and the Access-Point Name to which
   the client is attached.  The format of these sub-options is defined
   in the following sections.  The Network-Identifier sub-options are
   only for the currently known access-technology types.

4.3.1.  DHCPv4 Network-Name Sub-option

       0                   1                   2                   3

      .                     Network-Name (e.g., SSID or PLMNID)       .
      .                                                               .
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Subopt Code
      14

   Length
      The length of the Network-Name field.

   Network-Name
      The name of the access network to which the mobile node is
      attached.  The encoding MUST be UTF-8 as described in [RFC3629].

      The type of the Network-Name is dependent on the access technology
      to which the mobile node is attached.  For networks based on IEEE
      802.11, the Network-Name will be the SSID of the network.  For
      3GPP access-based networks, it is the PLMN Identifier of the
      access network, and for 3GPP2 access, the Network-Name is the ANI
      [ANI].

      When encoding the PLMN Identifier, both the Mobile Network Code
      (MNC) [TS23003] and Mobile Country Code (MCC) [TS23003] MUST be
      three digits.  If the MNC in use only has two digits, then it MUST
      be preceded with a '0'.

   Length
      The length of the Access-Point-Name field.

   Access-Point-Name
      The name of the access point (physical device name) to which the
      mobile node is attached.  This is the identifier that uniquely
      identifies the access point.  While the Network-Name (e.g., SSID)
      identifies the operator's access network, the Access-Point-Name
      identifies a specific network device in the network to which the
      mobile node is attached.  In some deployments, the Access-Point-
      Name can be set to the string representation of the Media Access
      Control (MAC) address of the device as specified in [RFC6991] (see
      mac-address typedef) or some unique identifier that can be used by
      the policy systems in the operator network to unambiguously
      identify the device.  The encoding MUST be UTF-8 as described in
      [RFC3629].

6.  Relay Agent Behavior

   DHCPv4 relay agents MAY include sub-options as defined in Section 4.2
   through 4.4 of [RFC3046] in the Relay Agent Information option for
   providing information about the access network over which DHCP
   messages from the client are received.

   The DHCPv4 relay agent MUST include the DHCPv4 Access-Technology-Type
   Sub-option (Section 4.2) when including any of these sub-options in
   the DHCP message: DHCPv4 Network-Name Sub-option (Section 4.3.1),
   DHCPv4 Access-Point-Name Sub-option (Section 4.3.2), and DHCPv4
   Access-Point-BSSID Sub-option (Section 4.3.3).

   DHCPv6 Relay Agents MAY include options (defined in Section 5) in the
   Relay-forward message when forwarding any DHCPv6 message type from
   clients to the servers to provide information about the access
   network over which DHCPv6 messages from the client are received.

   The DHCPv6 relay agent MUST include the DHCPv6 Access-Technology-Type
   Option (Section 5.1) when including any of these options in the DHCP
   message: DHCPv6 Network-Name Option (Section 5.2.1), DHCPv6 Access-
   Point-Name Option (Section 5.2.2), and DHCPv6 Access-Point-BSSID
   Option (Section 5.2.3).

7.  Server Behavior

   The DHCPv4 base specification [RFC2131] requires that the DHCPv4
   server ignore the DHCPv4 Access-Network-Identifier Option if it does
   not understand the option.

   If the DHCPv4 server does not understand the received sub-option
   defined in Sections 4.1 through 4.4 of [RFC3046], the DHCPv4 Relay-
   Agent-Information Option, it MUST ignore those sub-options only.  If
   the DHCPv4 server is able to process the DHCPv4 Access-Network-
   Identifier sub-options defined in Sections 4.1 through 4.4 of
   [RFC3046], the DHCPv4 Relay-Agent-Information Option, it MAY use this
   information obtained from the sub-option for address pool selection
   or for policy decisions as per its configured policy.  This
   information obtained from the sub-option SHOULD NOT be stored unless
   it is absolutely needed.  However, if it is stored, the information
   MUST be deleted as quickly as possible to eliminate any possibility
   of the information getting exposed to an intruder.

   The DHCPv4 server MUST ignore the received DHCPv4 Access-Network-
   Identifier Option and process the rest of the message as per the base
   DHCPv4 specifications if the received DHCPv4 message does not include
   the DHCPv4 Access-Technology-Type Sub-option (Section 4.2) but does
   include any one of these other options: DHCPv4 Network Name Sub-
   option (Section 4.3.1), DHCPv4 Access-Point-Name Sub-option
   (Section 4.3.2), or DHCPv4 Access-Point-BSSID Sub-option
   (Section 4.3.3).

   DHCPv6 base specification [RFC3315] requires that the DHCPv6 server
   ignore the DHCPv6 Access-Network-Identifier Option if it does not
   understand the option.

   If the DHCPv6 server receives the options defined in Section 5 and is
   configured to use the options defined in Section 5, it SHOULD look
   for the DHCPv6 Access-Network-Identifier options in the Relay-forward
   message of the DHCPv6 relay agent(s) based on its configured policy.
   The server MAY use received ANI options for its address pool
   selection policy decisions as per its configured policy.  This
   information obtained from the options SHOULD NOT be stored unless it
   is absolutely needed.  However, if it is stored, the information MUST
   be deleted as quickly as possible to eliminate any possibility of the
   information getting exposed to an intruder.

   The DHCPv6 server MUST ignore the received DHCPv6 Access-Network-
   Identifier Option and process the rest of the message as per the base
   DHCPv6 specifications if the received DHCPv6 message does not include
   the DHCPv6 Access-Technology-Type Option (Section 5.1) but it does
   includes any one of these other options: DHCPv6 Network-Name Option

   options from the "DHCP Relay Agent Sub-Option Codes" registry,

9.  Security Considerations

   Since there is no privacy protection for DHCP messages, an
   eavesdropper who can monitor the link between the DHCP server and
   relay agent can discover access-network information.

   [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] describe many of the threats in using DHCP.
   [RFC3118] and [RFC3315] each provide a solution; the Authentication
   Option for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 (respectively).  However, neither of
   these options are in active use and therefore are not a viable
   mitigation option.  DHCP itself is inherently insecure and thus link-
   layer confidentiality and integrity protection SHOULD be employed to
   reduce the risk of disclosure and tampering.

   It is possible for a rogue DHCP relay agent to insert or overwrite
   with incorrect Access-Network-Identifier options for malicious
   purposes.  A DHCP client can also pose as a rogue DHCP relay agent by
   sending incorrect Access-Network-Identifier options.  While the
   introduction of fraudulent DHCP relay agent information options can
   be prevented by a perimeter defense that blocks these options unless
   the DHCP relay agent is trusted, a deeper defense using the
   authentication sub-option for the DHCPv4 Relay-Agent-Information
   Option [RFC4030] SHOULD be deployed as well.  Administrators SHOULD
   configure DHCP servers that use this option to communicate with their
   relay agents using IPsec, as described in Section 21.1 of [RFC3315].

   The information elements that this document is exposing are the
   client's access-network information.  These pertain to the access
   network to which the client is attached, such as Access-Technology
   Type (e.g., WLAN, Ethernet, etc.), Access-Point Identity (Name,
   BSSID), and Operator-Identifier and Operator-Realm.  In deployments
   where this information cannot be secured using IPsec [RFC4301] or
   other security protocols, administrators SHOULD disable the
   capability specified in this document on the DHCP entities.
