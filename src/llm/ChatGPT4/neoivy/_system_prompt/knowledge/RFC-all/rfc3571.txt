Abstract

   This document describes a portion of the Policy Information Base
   (PIB) to control policy usage collection and reporting in a device.

   The provisioning classes specified here allow a Policy Decision Point
   (PDP) to select which policy objects should collect usage
   information, what information should be collected and when it should
   be reported.

   This PIB requires the presence of other PIBs (defined elsewhere) that
   provide the policy objects from which usage information is collected.

1.  Introduction

   The Framework of Common Open Policy Service with Policy Provisioning
   (COPS-PR) Usage Feedback describes the overall approach to policy
   usage monitoring and reporting.  This document defines the specific
   Policy Information Base (PIB) framework for policy usage feedback.
   The policy classes for monitoring and reporting policy usage
   feedback, as well as policy classes for controlling reporting
   intervals, suspension, resumption and solicitation are defined.

Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  General Concepts

2.1.  Selection, Usage and Linkage Policies

   There are three basic types of policies used to define what the PEP
   is to monitor, record and report.  These are the selection criteria
   policy, the usage policy and the feedback report linkage policy.

   The selection criteria policy is installed by the PDP.  It defines
   the conditions used by the PEP to monitor and record a usage policy.
   The selection criteria policy may only be used for defining usage
   feedback selection criteria.  However, a more general case is a
   policy that already exists for policy enforcement that may also be
   used for specifying feedback usage selection criteria.  An example of
   this is the frwkRoleCombo instance, which may be used in defining QoS
   enforcement policies, but may also be used to specify conditions on
   which to base usage - i.e. count the number of packets meeting the
   criterion of an interface capability set name and role combination.

   The usage policy defines what attributes are recorded by the PEP.
   These policies have an ACCESS clause of 'report-only'.  Generally,
   the usage policies specify counts related to a specific action such
   as a packet being dropped.  The feedback framework PIB defines two
   usage policy classes, frwkFeedbackTraffic and frwkFeedbackIfTraffic.
   Usage PRCs may be generic, collecting basic statistics, or they may
   be specific to a particular usage.  The PDP decides which PRC(s) best
   suit(s) its requirements.  The PEP may support only one usage
   feedback PRC, in which case all statistics are gathered using
   instances of that PRC.  Alternatively, the PEP may support multiple
   usage feedback PRCs.  The PDP then decides which PRC to associate
   with a particular selection criterion.

   A usage feedback policy and selection policy are tightly associated
   with one another.  A third policy, the frwkFeedbackLinkTable, is used
   to associate, or provide a linkage for the selection and usage
   policies.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable also specifies when to report
   the usage feedback.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable entry permits the same
   selection criteria instance to be re-used for various usage feedback
   policies.  The frwkFeedbackLinkTable contains the value of the
   selection criteria instance as well as the value of the usage
   feedback PRC.

                            Figure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the selection criteria,
   linkage and usage policies.

   The PDP is not aware of the instance identifier of the usage feedback
   policy when installing the selection criteria and feedback linkage
   policies.  The usage feedback policy is instantiated on the PEP by
   the installation of a feedback report linkage and the PEP designates
   the instance identifier.  The usage feedback policy class always
   contains an attribute of type ReferenceId that contains the instance
   value of the associated frwkFeedbackLinkTable instance installed by
   the PDP.  An example of this is the attribute
   frwkFeedbackTrafficLinkRef.

2.2.  Normal Operations

2.2.1.  Connection Establishment and Initial Configuration Request

   The Accounting Timer object in the COPS Connection Accept message
   contains the minimum number of seconds between reporting intervals as
   described in [COPS] and [FEEDBACKFWK].  This is used as the basic
   unit of measurement in defining intervals for specific usage policies
   with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute.

   The PEP notifies the PDP of the selection criteria policy classes and
   usage policy classes it supports during the initial request for
   configuration data using frwkPRCSupport instances [FR-PIB].  The PEP
   also indicates whether it supports the frwkFeedbackLinkTable as well.

   The PDP responds to the initial request for configuration with a
   DECISION that installs policies.  The PDP may also specify maximum
   reporting intervals associated with each of the usage policies.  This
   is done with the frwkFeedbackLinkInterval attribute in the
   frwkFeedbackLink class.  It may also specify reporting thresholds by
   including an instance of a threshold class (e.g.
   frwkFeedbackTrafficThreshold) in the decision.  The PEP monitors and
   records the usage per the conditions defined by its associated
   selection criteria policy.  Periodically the PEP reports the usage



Rawlins, et al.              Informational                      [Page 4]

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


   with a REPORT message or provides a REPORT when solicited by the PDP.
   The PDP solicits usage feedback with the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator
   attribute of the frwkFeedbackAction class.

2.2.2.  Unsolicited Reports - Periodic Reporting

   Reporting may be periodic in nature and unsolicited.  The intervals
   at which the unsolicited reports are provided by the PEP are defined
   in the specific Linkage policies.  The defined intervals are based on
   the number of seconds specified by the PDP in the ACCT Timer value.
   The PDP may specify that the associated usage instance be included in
   a periodic unsolicited report only if the threshold is reached and/or
   if the usage value has changed from the previous reporting interval.

   There are cases when the PEP must supply unsolicited feedback reports
   that may not fall on an interval boundary.  The PEP MUST provide an
   unsolicited REPORT containing all defined usage instances just prior
   to the PEP issuing a Delete Request State and just prior to the PEP
   de-activating a PIB instance context.

2.2.3.  Unsolicited Reports - Reporting Conditions

   Periodic unsolicited reports for individual usage feedback instances
   can be suppressed by specifying additional conditions in the
   frwkFeedbackLink instances.  Supported conditions are:

   ChangeOnly
      If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags attribute, the
      associated usage instance is only included in a periodic
      unsolicited report if its value changed since the last unsolicited
      report.

   Threshold
      If this flag is set in the frwkFeedbackLinkFlags attribute, the
      associated usage instance is only included in a periodic
      unsolicited report if the threshold condition referenced in the
      frwkLinkThreshold field evaluates successfully for the associated
      usage instance.

   Both conditions can be combined in one frwkFeedbackLinkUsage object.
   In this case, both conditions need to succeed for the usage instance
   to be reported.

   Unsolicited reports triggered by a Delete Request State or the
   deactivation of a PIB instance are not subject to these conditions -
   all usage objects must be included in these cases.

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


2.2.4.  Solicited Reports

   The PDP may solicit policy usage feedback by issuing an unsolicited
   Decision containing the frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to
   `solicitReport'.  The PEP is to provide a solicited REPORT feedback
   containing usage feedback.  The PEP shall continue to provide
   periodic feedback at the specified intervals established at client
   connection acceptance.

   The reporting conditions (ChangeOnly and Threshold) do not affect
   solicited reports - all requested usage instances must be included.

2.2.5.  Resuming and Suspending Periodic Feedback Reporting

   The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and tracking at the PEP with the
   frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to 'suspendMonitoringAndReports'.
   The PEP must stop tracking usage information and must not issue any
   feedback reports.  The PDP may only suspend feedback reporting by
   setting the ActionIndicator to 'suspendReports'.  The PEP must cease
   sending unsolicited reports but is to continue monitoring and
   tracking usage.  The PDP may resume the sending of feedback reports
   and may resume usage monitoring by setting the ActionIndicator to
   'resume'.

   The PDP may suspend or resume all usage instances or the PDP may
   specify one or more instances that are to be suspended or resumed.
   The frwkFeedbackActionList attribute contains a tag identifier that
   references a list of one or more frwkFeedbackActionList instances.

   The PDP may halt usage monitoring, tracking and reporting of usage
   policies by removing the associated Linkage entry.

2.2.6.  Failover

   In the event that the connection is lost between the PEP and PDP, the
   PEP continues to track usage information as long as it continues to
   operate with the installed policy.  When the locally installed policy
   at the PEP expires, the usage policy data also expires.

   Upon successful reconnection where the PEP is still caching policy,
   the PDP indicates to the PEP that the PEP may resume sending of the
   COPS accounting type report messages.  The PDP does this by issuing
   an unsolicited decision containing the frwkFeedbackResumeIndicator
   set to 'resume'.  The PEP should resume reporting at the next
   appropriate feedback interval established upon the acceptance of the
   re-connection.  The PDP is aware of the request state Handle(s) and





Rawlins, et al.              Informational                      [Page 6]

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


   the supported PRCs either through the state synchronization mechanism
   or because the PDP considers itself synchronized with the PEP upon
   reconnection.

2.3.  Usage Policy and Under-specified Selection Criteria

   Some of the usage policy objects created in the PEP with COPS-PR can
   be used by the PEP multiple times - they effectively act as templates
   for the objects created by the PEP.  COPS-PR only has the identity
   (OID) of the object that is shared between all the assignments the
   PEP created.  However it is desirable to collect usage information
   for each of the derived objects individually.

   This capability is achieved in the feedback framework PIB by
   distributing additional information to qualify a specific assignment
   of an object between the selection criteria PRC and the feedback
   usage PRC.

   A selection criteria PRC that refers to a shared object, but contains
   no qualifying information, selects all of the object's assignments.
   Such a selection criteria PRC SHOULD be combined with a feedback
   usage PRC that includes all the necessary information to identify a
   specific assignment - a single selection criteria policy can then
   result in the generation of many feedback usage objects, one for each
   derived object.

   If the selection criteria PRC contains all the required qualifying
   attributes for a specific assignment, it is combined with a feedback
   usage PRC that only contains the desired metrics but no additional
   attributes.

   Example:

      A frwkRoleCombo instance may be used as a selection criteria,
      identifying a set of interfaces through their role combination and
      capability set.  If it is desired to get per-interface traffic
      statistics, the usage PRC has to include an additional attribute
      to qualify the specific interface.

      This could be achieved by linking the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic class
      with a frwkRoleCombo instance in a frwkFeedbackLink instance.
      Multiple frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances will be created by the
      PEP, one for each interface selected by the frwkRoleCombo
      instance.  The frwkFeedbackIfTraffic class contains the
      frwkFeedbackIfTrafficIfIndex attribute that allows the PDP to
      identify each interface's individual counters when the PEP reports
      the frwkFeedbackIfTraffic instances.




Rawlins, et al.              Informational                      [Page 7]

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


      If traffic usage collection is only desired for an individual
      interface, a selection criteria should be used that qualifies the
      interface completely, for example a frwkIfRoleCombo instance.  In
      this case, it can be linked to the usage class that has no
      additional qualifying attributes, frwkFeedbackTraffic.

3.  Summary of the Feedback Framework Policy Information Base

3.1.  SPPI ACCESS Clause Report-Only

   The selection criteria and linkage policy classes follow the
   definitions specified by [SPPI].  This structure specifies well-
   defined policy classes and their instances residing in a common,
   virtual repository [FR-PIB].  The additional PIB-ACCESS clause
   attribute of "report-only" denotes the usage policy class reported by
   the PEP.

3.2.  Usage32 and Usage64 Textual Conventions

   The SPPI does not support the Counter32/64 textual conventions (TC)
   of SNMP - for feedback collection two similar textual conventions
   have been defined in this PIB: Usage32 and Usage64.

   In addition to the differential functionality of 'Counter', where
   only the difference between two samples generally carries
   information, a single value of a 'Usage' attribute usually provides
   absolute information, since

   -  its initial value is known (0)
   -  no wrap-around events should occur
   -  the time or event when the initial value was set should be
      available directly or indirectly from other objects.

   When 'Usage' attributes are defined in a PRC, events that could cause
   a reset of the attribute to its initial value should be defined in
   the description as well as the mechanism that allows the PDP to
   detect the time of the last reset.

   No usual COPS activity however should cause the reset of a Usage
   attribute.  In the case of a suspension of monitoring activity
   (frwkFeedbackActionIndicator set to 'suspendMonitoringAndReports'),
    'Usage' attributes should keep their values and continue counting
   after monitoring is resumed.

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


3.3.  Feedback Groups and PRCs

   These policy classes defined in this PIB are common to account type
   reporting for various technologies and apply to ALL SUBJECT-
   CATEGORIES.  The policy classes are divided into three new groups,
   namely, The Feedback Report Group, The Feedback Usage Group and The
   Feedback Selection Group.

   The policy classes in the Feedback Report Group are:

   -  Feedback Action
   -  Feedback Action List
   -  Feedback Selection Usage Combination Capability
   -  Feedback Linkage
   -  Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold

   The policy classes in the Feedback Usage Group are:

   -  Feedback Traffic
   -  Feedback Interface Traffic

   The policy class in the Feedback Selection Group is:

   -  Feedback RoleCombo Filter Selection

3.3.1.  Feedback Action

   The Feedback Action class contains the attributes that specify action
   that the PEP is to take regarding policy usage, monitoring and
   tracking.  The PDP may suspend usage monitoring and periodic
   reporting, suspend periodic reporting only, resume usage and periodic
   reporting or solicit immediate reporting.  The action may affect all
   feedback policies or be associated with one or more frwkFeedbackLink
   instances.

   The frwkFeedbackActionIndicator attribute defines the action.  The
   frwkFeedbackActionPri attribute indicates whether the action applies
   to all of the usage policies or to a list.  The
   frwkFeedbackActionList attribute is the identifier of the list of
   Linkage policy instances to which the action is to be applied.

   The PDP can solicit the PEP for immediate usage feedback.  The PEP
   shall respond with a solicited report containing the usage feedback.

   The PDP can direct the resumption of usage monitoring and reporting
   per the defined intervals.  For example, the PEP may have re-
   connected to a PDP and has cached usage policies.  The PDP indicates
   to the PEP to resume usage tracking and monitoring and to send all



Rawlins, et al.              Informational                      [Page 9]

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


   the cached usage policy.  The PEP shall respond at the next
   appropriate interval with an unsolicited report containing the usage
   feedback.

   The PDP can suspend the monitoring of usage policy.  The PEP
   maintains the current usage that has been monitored, but discontinues
   any further monitoring until the PDP directs the PEP to resume
   monitoring in a subsequent Decision.

   The PDP can also suspend just the reporting of usage, but not
   interrupt the monitoring and tracking of usage.  The PEP shall
   discontinue sending Report messages with usage feedback until the PDP
   directs the PEP to resume.  The PEP then begins reporting the usage
   feedback at the next interval.

3.3.2.  Feedback Action List

   This class defines sets of linkage instances that can be referred to
   from the frwkFeedbackActionList attribute.

3.3.3.  Feedback Linkage Capability

   This class defines the valid selection criteria PRC, usage PRC and
   threshold PRC combinations supported by the PEP.

3.3.4.  Feedback Linkage

   This class links the selection criteria instance with the usage
   class.  This table permits the reuse of a selection criteria instance
   for multiple usage policies.

   The linkage table also permits the definition of a maximum reporting
   interval to use when issuing the COPS accounting type reports for the
   usage instance.  A value of 0 in this attribute indicates that the
   usage policy must be solicited.

3.3.5.  Feedback Traffic Statistics Threshold

   This class is used to provide threshold values for the attributes
   described in the traffic usage classes below.

3.3.6.  Feedback Traffic

   This class includes the packet counts, byte counts and a reference to
   the associated Linkage instance.

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


3.3.7.  Feedback Interface Traffic

   This class is similar to the previous Feedback Traffic class, except
   that it includes an additional reference to an interface index.  This
   class should be used with a selection criteria instance that matches
   an element that is assigned to multiple interfaces.  The interface
   field can be used to associate the instances of this table with the
   specific element's assignment.

3.3.8.  Feedback RoleCombo Filter Selection

   This class is used as selection criteria based on role combination,
   capability set and a filter instance.

        DESCRIPTION
                "The Usage32 type represents a non-negative integer
                which monotonically increases.
                Usage32 initial value is 0 and the object-type using
                Usage32 needs to specify when it is initialized.

                The Usage32 type is intended to reflect the absolute
                number of counted events, so that even a new PDP
                after a COPS reconnect can use the value directly.

                If there is the possibility that the maximum Usage32
                value of 2^32-1 is exceeded during the lifetime
                of the Usage32 object, the larger Usage64 type
                should be used.

                If conditions other than the reset of the COPS
                subsystem exist that disrupt the monotonic
                characteristics of Usage32, these conditions and a
                method how to detect their presence should be
                specified in the description of the object-type using
                Usage32 or its enclosing object-types (e.g. the
                Entry or Table object-type of the Usage32
                object-type).

                Whenever the monotonic increase of Usage32 is violated,
                it should be reset to 0 and the fact that this occurred
                should be indicated through an appropriate mechanism,
                for example a corresponding object of type TimeStamp
                or TimeAndDate."

5.  Security Considerations

   This PIB defines structured information that may be sensitive when
   transported by the COPS protocol [COPS-PR].

   This PIB does not contain classes that directly contain security
   relevant information like passwords or monetary amounts.  However,
   unauthorized access or changes to information defined in this PIB
   could compromise network operations or reveal sensitive business or
   personal information.

   Specifically for the classes:

   frwkFeedbackLinkCaps

      This class has the ACCESS clause 'notify'.  Access to this
      information reveals feedback collection capabilities of the COPS
      client and malicious changes could affect feedback operation by
      misleading the server to generate corrupt feedback configuration.

   frwkFeedbackLinkTable, frwkFeedbackAction, frwkFeedbackActionList,
   frwkFeedbackTrafficThres, frwkFeedbackRoleFilterSel

      These classes have the ACCESS clause 'install' and allow the COPS
      server to control feedback collection and reporting on the client.
      Access to this information exposes the client's configuration;
      malicious changes could disrupt network or business operations and
      raise privacy issues.

   frwkFeedbackTraffic, frwkFeedbackIfTraffic

      These classes have the ACCESS clause 'report-only' and contain the
      usage information delivered from the COPS client to the server.
      Unauthorized access to this information may reveal detailed
      information on the network and its users.  Malicious changes may
      affect network and business operations.

RFC 3571                 Framework Feedback PIB              August 2003


   [COPS] and [COPS-PR] define mechanisms to secure the COPS protocol
   communication and implementations of COPS servers or clients
   supporting this PIB MUST follow the security guidelines specified
   there.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the frwkFeedbackPib Policy Information Base
   (PIB) module for registration under the "pib" branch registered with
   IANA.  The IANA has assigned PIB number 5.

   This PIB uses "all" in the SUBJECT-CATEGORY clause, so it applies to
   all COPS client types.  No new COPS client type is requested for this
   PIB.

   Fenger of Intel and John K. Gallant of WorldCom for their
