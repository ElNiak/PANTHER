                 Deprecating RC4 in Secure Shell (SSH)

Abstract

   This document deprecates RC4 in Secure Shell (SSH).  Therefore, this
   document formally moves RFC 4345 to Historic status.

1.  Introduction

   The usage of RC4 suites (also designated as "arcfour") for SSH is
   specified in [RFC4253] and [RFC4345].  [RFC4253] specifies the
   allocation of the "arcfour" cipher for SSH.  [RFC4345] specifies and
   allocates the "arcfour128" and "arcfour256" ciphers for SSH.  RC4
   encryption has known weaknesses [RFC7465] [RFC8429]; therefore, this
   document starts the deprecation process for their use in Secure Shell
   (SSH) [RFC4253].  Accordingly, [RFC4253] is updated to note the
   deprecation of the RC4 ciphers, and [RFC4345] is moved to Historic
   status, as all ciphers it specifies MUST NOT be used.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Updates to RFC 4253

   [RFC4253] is updated to prohibit arcfour's use in SSH.  [RFC4253],
   Section 6.3 allocates the "arcfour" cipher by defining a list of
   defined ciphers in which the "arcfour" cipher appears as optional, as
   shown in Table 1.

   +---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+
   | arcfour | OPTIONAL | the ARCFOUR stream cipher                    |
   |         |          | with a 128-bit key                           |
   +---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

   This document updates the status of the "arcfour" ciphers in the list
   found in [RFC4253], Section 6.3 by moving it from OPTIONAL to MUST
   NOT.

   +---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+
   | arcfour | MUST NOT | the ARCFOUR stream cipher                    |
   |         |          | with a 128-bit key                           |
   +---------+----------+----------------------------------------------+

                                  Table 2

   [RFC4253] defines the "arcfour" ciphers with the following text:

   |  The "arcfour" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit
   |  keys.  The Arcfour cipher is believed to be compatible with the
   |  RC4 cipher [SCHNEIER].  Arcfour (and RC4) has problems with weak
   |  keys, and should be used with caution.

   This document updates [RFC4253], Section 6.3 by replacing the text
   above with the following text:

   |  The "arcfour" cipher is the Arcfour stream cipher with 128-bit
   |  keys.  The Arcfour cipher is compatible with the RC4 cipher
   |  [SCHNEIER].  Arcfour (and RC4) has known weaknesses [RFC7465]
   |  [RFC8429] and MUST NOT be used.

3.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has updated the "Encryption Algorithm Names" subregistry in
   the "Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Parameters" registry [IANA].  The
   registration procedure is IETF review, which is achieved by this
   document.  The registry has been updated as follows:

           +---------------------------+-----------+----------+
           | Encryption Algorithm Name | Reference | Note     |
           +===========================+===========+==========+
           | arcfour                   | RFC 8758  | HISTORIC |
           +---------------------------+-----------+----------+
           | arcfour128                | RFC 8758  | HISTORIC |
           +---------------------------+-----------+----------+
           | arcfour256                | RFC 8758  | HISTORIC |
           +---------------------------+-----------+----------+

                                 Table 3

4.  Security Considerations

   This document only prohibits the use of RC4 in SSH; it introduces no
   new security considerations.
