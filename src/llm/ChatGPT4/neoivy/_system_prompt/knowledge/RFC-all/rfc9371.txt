1.  Introduction

   Private Enterprise Numbers (PENs) are identifiers that can be used
   anywhere that an ASN.1 object identifier (OID) [ASN1] can be used.
   Originally, PENs were developed so that organizations that needed to
   identify themselves in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   [RFC3411] Management Information Base (MIB) configurations could do
   so easily.  PENs are also useful in any application or configuration
   language that needs OIDs to identify organizations.

   The IANA Functions Operator, referred to in this document as "IANA",
   manages and maintains the PEN registry in consultation with the IESG.
   PENs are issued from an OID prefix that was assigned to IANA.  That
   OID prefix is 1.3.6.1.4.1.  Using the (now archaic) notation of
   ownership names in the OID tree, that corresponds to:

   1   3   6   1        4       1
   iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprise

   A PEN is an OID that begins with the PEN prefix.  Thus, the OID
   1.3.6.1.4.1.32473 is a PEN.

1.1.  Uses of PENs

   Once a PEN has been assigned to an organization, individual, or other
   entity, that assignee can use the PEN by itself (possibly to
   represent the assignee) or as the root of other OIDs associated with
   the assignee.  For example, if an assignee is assigned the PEN
   1.3.6.1.4.1.32473, it might use 1.3.6.1.4.1.32473.7 to identify a
   protocol extension and use 1.3.6.1.4.1.32473.12.3 to identify a set
   of algorithms that it supports in a protocol.

   Neither IANA nor the IETF can control how an assignee uses its PEN.
   In fact, no one can exert such control: that is the meaning of
   "private" in "private enterprise number".  Similarly, no one can
   prevent an assignee that is not the registered owner of a PEN from
   using that PEN, or any PEN, however they want.

   A very common use of PENs is to give unique identifiers in IETF
   protocols.  SNMP MIB configuration files use PENs for identifying the
   origin of values.  Protocols that use PENs as identifiers of
   extension mechanisms include RADIUS [RFC2865], Diameter [RFC6733],
   Syslog [RFC5424], RSVP [RFC5284], and vCard [RFC6350].

2.  PEN Assignment

   PENs are assigned by IANA.  The registry is located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers>, and requests
   for new assignments or the modification of existing assignments can
   also be submitted at that URL.

   IANA maintains the PEN registry in accordance with the "First Come
   First Served" registration policy described in [RFC8126].  Values are
   assigned sequentially.

2.1.  Requesting a PEN Assignment

   Requests for assignment must provide the name of the assignee, the
   name of a public contact who can respond to questions about the
   assignment, and contact information that can be used to verify change
   requests.  The contact's name and email address will be included in
   the public registry.

   A prospective assignee may request multiple PENs, but obtaining one
   PEN and making internal sub-assignments is typically more
   appropriate.  (Sub-assignments should not be reported to IANA.)

   IANA may refuse to process abusive requests.

2.2.  Modifying an Existing Record

   Any of the information associated with a registered value can be
   modified, including the name of the assignee.

   Modification requests require authorization by a representative of
   the assignee.  Authorization will be validated either with
   information kept on file with IANA or with other identifying
   documentation, if necessary.

2.3.  Deleting a PEN Record

   Although such requests are rare, registrations can be deleted.  When
   a registration is deleted, all identifying information is removed
   from the registry, and the value is marked as "returned."  Returned
   values will not be made available for reassignment until all other
   unassigned values have been exhausted; as can be seen in Section 3,
   the unassigned values are unlikely to ever run out.

3.  PEN Registry Specifics

   The range for values after the PEN prefix is 0 to 2**32-1.  The
   values 0 and 4294967295 (2**32-1) are reserved.  Note that while the
   original PEN definition had no upper bound for the value after the
   PEN prefix, there is now an upper bound due to some IETF protocols
   limiting the size of that value.  For example, Diameter [RFC6733]
   limits the value to 2**32-1.

   There is a PEN number, 32473, reserved for use as an example in
   documentation.  This reservation is described in [RFC5612].

   Values in the registry that have unclear ownership are marked
   "Reserved".  These values will not be reassigned to a new company or
   individual without consulting the IESG.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA has made the following changes to the PEN
   registry:

   *  Values 2187, 2188, 3513, 4164, 4565, 4600, 4913, 4999, 5099, 5144,
      5201, 5683, 5777, 6260, 6619, 14827, 16739, 26975, and the range
      from 11670 to 11769, which had been missing from the registry,
      have been listed as "Reserved."  As described in [RFC8126],
      reserved values can be released by the IESG.

   *  This document has been listed in the registry's "Reference" field.

   *  "First Come First Served" has been listed as its registration
      procedure.

5.  Security Considerations

   Registering PENs does not introduce any significant security
   considerations.

   There is no cryptographic binding of a registrant in the PEN registry
   and the PEN(s) assigned to them.  Thus, the entries in the PEN
   registry cannot be used to validate the ownership of a PEN in use.
   For example, if the PEN 1.3.6.1.4.1.32473 is seen in a protocol as
   indicating the owner of some data, there is no way to securely
   correlate that use with the name and assignee of the owner listed in
   the PEN registry.
