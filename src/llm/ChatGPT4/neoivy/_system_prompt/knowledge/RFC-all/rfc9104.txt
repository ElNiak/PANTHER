1.  Introduction

   Administrative groups (commonly referred to as "colors" or "link
   colors") are link attributes that are advertised by link-state
   protocols like IS-IS [RFC1195], OSPFv2 [RFC2328], and OSPFv3
   [RFC5340].  The Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS)
   advertisement of the originally defined (non-extended) administrative
   groups is encoded using the Administrative Group (color) TLV 1088 as
   defined in [RFC7752].

   These administrative groups are defined as a fixed-length 32-bit
   bitmask.  As networks grew and more use cases were introduced, the
   32-bit length was found to be constraining, and hence extended
   administrative groups (EAGs) were introduced in [RFC7308].

   The EAG TLV (Section 2) is not a replacement for the Administrative
   Group (color) TLV; as explained in [RFC7308], both values can
   coexist.  It is out of scope for this document to specify the
   behavior of the BGP-LS consumer [RFC7752].

   This document specifies an extension to BGP-LS for advertisement of
   the extended administrative groups.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Advertising Extended Administrative Groups in BGP-LS

   This document defines an extension that enables BGP-LS speakers to
   signal the EAG of links in a network to a BGP-LS consumer of network
   topology such as a centralized controller.  The centralized
   controller can leverage this information in traffic engineering
   computations and other use cases.  When a BGP-LS speaker is
   originating the topology learned via link-state routing protocols
   like OSPF or IS-IS, the EAG information of the links is sourced from
   the underlying extensions as defined in [RFC7308].

   The EAG of a link is encoded in a new Link Attribute TLV [RFC7752]
   using the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    Extended Administrative Group (variable)                  //
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

             Figure 1: Extended Administrative Group TLV Format

   Where:

   Type:  1173

   Length:  variable length that represents the total length of the
      value field in octets.  The length value MUST be a multiple of 4.
      If the length is not a multiple of 4, the TLV MUST be considered
      malformed.

   Value:  one or more sets of 32-bit bitmasks that indicate the
      administrative groups (colors) that are enabled on the link when
      those specific bits are set.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a code point from the "BGP-LS Node Descriptor, Link
   Descriptor, Prefix Descriptor, and Attribute TLVs" registry as
   described in the following table.

    +============+===============================+===================+
    | Code Point | Description                   | IS-IS TLV/Sub-TLV |
    +============+===============================+===================+
    | 1173       | Extended Administrative Group | 22/14             |
    +------------+-------------------------------+-------------------+

                                 Table 1

4.  Manageability Considerations

   The new protocol extensions introduced in this document augment the
   existing IGP topology information that is distributed via [RFC7752].
   Procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do not
   affect the BGP protocol operations and management other than as
   discussed in Section 6 ("Manageability Considerations") of [RFC7752].
   Specifically, the tests for malformed attributes, to perform
   syntactic checks as described in Section 6.2.2 ("Fault Management")
   of [RFC7752], now encompass the new BGP-LS Attribute TLV defined in
   this document.  The semantic or content checking for the TLV
   specified in this document and its association with the BGP-LS
   Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) types or its BGP-LS
   Attribute are left to the consumer of the BGP-LS information (e.g.,
   an application or a controller) and not to BGP itself.

   A consumer of the BGP-LS information retrieves this information over
   a BGP-LS session (refer to Sections 1 and 2 of [RFC7752]).

5.  Security Considerations

   The procedures and protocol extensions defined in this document do
   not affect the BGP security model.  See the "Security Considerations"
   section of [RFC4271] for a discussion of BGP security.  This document
   only introduces a new Attribute TLV, and any syntactic error in it
   would result in the BGP-LS Attribute being discarded [RFC7752].
   Also, refer to [RFC4272] and [RFC6952] for analyses of security
   issues for BGP.  Security considerations for acquiring and
   distributing BGP-LS information are discussed in [RFC7752].  The TLV
   introduced in this document is used to propagate the EAG extensions
   defined in [RFC7308].  It is assumed that the IGP instances
   originating this TLV will support any required security mechanisms
   for OSPF and IS-IS, in order to prevent any security issues when
   propagating the Sub-TLVs into BGP-LS.

   Security concerns for OSPF are addressed in [RFC7474], [RFC4552], and
   [RFC7166].  Further security analysis for the OSPF protocol is done
   in [RFC6863].

   Security considerations for IS-IS are specified by [RFC5304].

   The advertisement of the link attribute information defined in this
   document presents no significant additional risk beyond that
   associated with the existing link attribute information already
   supported in [RFC7752].
