       DNS Root Name Service Protocol and Deployment Requirements

Abstract

   The DNS root name service is a critical part of the Internet
   architecture.  The protocol and deployment requirements for the DNS
   root name service are defined in this document.  Operational
   requirements are out of scope.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC2870] discusses protocol and operational requirements for root
   name servers for the Internet's domain name system (DNS) protocol
   [RFC1035].  Since its publication, both protocol and operational
   requirements have evolved.  It makes more sense now to separate the
   two sets of requirements into two separate documents.  This document
   only defines the protocol requirements and some deployment
   requirements.  The operational requirements that were defined in RFC
   2870 have been removed.  Operational requirements are now defined by
   the Root Server System Advisory Committee of ICANN and are documented
   in [RSSAC-001].

   The root servers are authoritative servers of the unique [RFC2826]
   root zone (".") [ROOTZONE].  They currently also serve the root-
   servers.net zone.  Some also serve the zone for the .arpa top-level
   domain [ARPAZONE] [RFC3172].  This document describes the external
   interface of the root name servers from a protocol viewpoint of the
   service.  It specifies basic requirements for the Internet that DNS
   clients meet when interacting with a root name service over the
   public Internet.

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, [RFC2119].

1.1.  Relationship to RFC 2870

   This document obsoletes [RFC2870].

   This document and [RSSAC-001] together functionally replace
   [RFC2870].

RFC 7720             Root Name Service Requirements        December 2015


2.  Protocol Requirements

   This section describes the minimum high-level protocol requirements.
   Operative details are documented in [RSSAC-001].

   The root name service:

   o  MUST implement core DNS [RFC1035] and clarifications to the DNS
      [RFC2181].

   o  MUST support IPv4 [RFC791] and IPv6 [RFC2460] transport of DNS
      queries and responses.

   o  MUST support UDP [RFC768] and TCP [RFC793] transport of DNS
      queries and responses.

   o  MUST generate checksums when sending UDP datagrams and MUST verify
      checksums when receiving UDP datagrams containing a non-zero
      checksum.

   o  MUST implement DNSSEC [RFC4035] as an authoritative name service.

   o  MUST implement extension mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) [RFC6891].

3.  Deployment Requirements

   The root name service:

   o  MUST answer queries from any entity conforming to [RFC1122] with a
      valid IP address.

   o  MUST serve the unique [RFC2826] root zone [ROOTZONE].

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not specify a new protocol.  However, the root
   name service is a key component of the Internet architecture and play
   a key role into the overall security of the Internet [RFC2826].
   Specific security considerations on the DNS protocols are discussed
   in their respective specifications.  The security considerations on
   the operational side of the root name servers are discussed in
   [RSSAC-001].
