1.  Introduction

   The third-generation partnership project 2 (3GPP2) for 3rd generation
   cellular telephony has defined a standard file format to contain
   audio/visual sequences that may be downloaded to cellular phones
   [3gpp2].  At the time of writing, the 3GPP2 file format (3G2) can
   contain H.263, H.264, or MPEG-4 video; and 13K Vocoder, EVRC or AMR
   Narrow-band speech, or AAC audio; and 3GPP timed text.

RFC 4393             3GPP2 Multimedia Registrations           March 2006


   Within the file, as with all files in the 'ISO' family, there is an
   intrinsic file-type box, which identifies those specifications to
   which the file complies, and which players (possibly compliant with
   only one specification) are permitted by the content author to play
   the file.  This identification is through four-letter 'brands'.
   Files identified by the MIME [MIME1] type defined in this document
   MUST contain, in their compatible brands list, a brand defined in a
   standard (issued by 3GPP2) that can apply to 3GPP2 files.

   The MIME types defined in this document are needed correctly to
   identify such files when they are served over HTTP, included in
   multi-part documents, or used in other places where MIME types are
   used.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [RFC2119].

2.  Security Considerations

   The 3GPP2 file format may contain audio, video, and displayable text
   data.  There is currently no provision for 'active' elements (such as
   scripts) of any kind.

   Clearly, it is possible to author malicious files that attempt to
   call for an excessively large picture size, high sampling-rate audio,
   etc.  However, clients can and usually do protect themselves against
   this kind of attack.

   It should be noted that selected metadata fields may encompass
   information partly intended to protect the media against unauthorized
   use or distribution.  In this case, the intention is that alteration
   or removal of the data in the field would be treated as an offense
   under national agreement-based World Intellectual Property
   Organization (WIPO) treaties.

   3GPP2 files have an extensible structure, so it is theoretically
   possible that metadata fields or media formats could be defined in
   the future that could be used to induce particular actions on the
   part of the recipient, thus presenting additional security risks; but
   this type of capability is currently not supported in the referenced
   specification.

   Encryption, signing, or authentication of these file formats can be
   done using any media-independent transformations of the file or media
   data.

3.  MIME Types

   This registration applies to all files defined as using the '3G2'
   file format and identified with a suitable brand in a 3GPP2
   specification.  The usual file suffix for all these files is ".3g2".

3.1.  Files with Audio but No Video

   The type "audio/3gpp2" may be used for files containing audio but no
   visual presentation (neither video nor timed text, for example).

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject:  Registration of Standard MIME media type audio/3gpp2

   MIME media type name:
       audio
   MIME subtype name:
       3gpp2
   Required parameters:
       None.
   Optional parameters:
       Codecs. See [Bucket].  If the audio/3gpp2 body part contains
       another container format, the Codecs parameter MUST list all
       codecs indicated by all formats, including any contained formats.
   Optional parameter values:
       [3gpp2]
   Encoding considerations:
       This data is binary and should be transmitted in a suitable
       encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping, etc.; base64
       is a suitable encoding.  Note that this MIME type is used only
       for files; separate types are used for real-time transfer, such
       as for the RTP payload format for 13K vocoder speech [RFC2658].
   Security considerations:
       See the security considerations section in RFC 4393 (this
       document).
   Interoperability considerations:
       The 3GPP2 organization has defined the specification of the media
       format [3gpp2].  Interoperability and conformance testing is done
       in cooperation with other bodies, including the Open Mobile
       Alliance (OMA) <http://www.openmobilealliance.org> and the
       International Multimedia Telecommunications Consortium (IMTC)
       <http://www.imtc.org/>.

   Published specification:
       3GPP2 C.S0045, 3GPP2 C.S0050 [3gpp2]
       3GPP2 specifications are publicly accessible at the 3GPP2 web
       site, <http://www.3gpp2.org>.
   Applications that use this media type:
       Multi-media
   Additional information:
       The type "audio/3gpp2" MAY be used for files containing audio but
       no visual presentation.  Files served under this type MUST NOT
       contain any visual material.  (Note that 3GPP timed text is
       visually presented and is considered visual material).
   Magic number(s):
       None.  However, the file-type box must occur first in the file,
       and MUST contain a 3GPP2 brand in its compatible brands list.
   File extension(s):
       3g2 and 3gpp2 are both declared at <http://www.nist.gov/nics/>;
       3g2 is preferred.
   Macintosh file type code(s):
       '3gp2'

   Intended usage:
       COMMON
   Change controller:

3.2.  Any Files

   The type "video/3gpp2" is valid for all files.  It is valid to serve
   an audio-only file as "video/3gpp2".

   To: ietf-types@iana.org
   Subject:  Registration of Standard MIME media type video/3gpp2

   MIME media type name:
       video
   MIME subtype name:
       3gpp2
   Required parameters:
       None
   Optional parameters:
       Codecs. See [Bucket].  If the video/3gpp2 body part contains
       another container format, the Codecs parameter MUST list all
       codecs indicated by all formats, including any contained formats.
   Optional parameter values:
       [3gpp2]
