                Responsibility Change for the RFC Series

Abstract

   In RFC 9280, responsibility for the RFC Series moved to the RFC
   Series Working Group and the RFC Series Approval Board.  It is no
   longer the responsibility of the RFC Editor, and the role of the IAB
   in the RFC Series is altered.  Accordingly, in Section 2.1 of RFC
   2026, the sentence "RFC publication is the direct responsibility of
   the RFC Editor, under the general direction of the IAB" is deleted.
