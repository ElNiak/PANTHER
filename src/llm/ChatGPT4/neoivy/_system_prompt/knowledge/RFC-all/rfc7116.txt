Abstract

   The DTNRG Research Group has defined the experimental Licklider
   Transmission Protocol (LTP) and the Compressed Bundle Header Encoding
   (CBHE) mechanism for the InterPlanetary Network ('ipn' URI scheme).
   Moreover, RFC 5050 defines values for the Bundle Protocol
   administrative record type.  All of these fields are subject to a
   registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the group has
   created ad hoc registries.  As the specifications are stable and have
   multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand
   off the registries to IANA for official management.  This document
   describes the necessary IANA actions.

1.  Introduction

   The DTNRG Research Group has defined the Licklider Transmission
   Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326].  LTP contains certain fields that are
   subject to a registry.  For the purpose of its research work, the
   group has created ad hoc registries.  As the specifications are
   stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group
   would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official
   management.  This document describes the actions that IANA needs to
   take and uses the well-known IANA policy definitions as described in
   Section 4.1 of [RFC5226].

   The Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] specification
   defines the concepts of 'Node Number' and 'Service Number' in the
   'ipn' URI scheme.  In this document, we request formation of IANA
   registries for these fields.

RFC 7116            LTP, CBHE, and BP IANA Registries      February 2014


   Because of its association with space communication and the
   Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems [CCSDS], portions of
   the "CBHE Node Numbers", "CBHE Service Numbers", and "LTP Engine
   Numbers" spaces are delegated by this document to the CCSDS Space
   Assigned Numbers Authority [SANA].  SANA functions similarly to IANA
   in that it maintains registries of managed values, with a focus on
   values used by protocols used by CCSDS member agencies.

   This document represents the consensus of the DTNRG.  It has been
   discussed and reviewed by the research group and interested parties.

2.  Security Considerations

   This document requests the creation of registries managed by IANA.
   There are no security issues involved.  Refer to the Security
   Considerations section of [RFC5326] for security issues with LTP.

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has created the registries described in this section.

3.1.  Licklider Transmission Protocol

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has fields requiring registries
   managed by IANA.  This document requests the creation of the three
   registries in this section and requests that they be associated with
   the other LTP registries.

3.1.1.  LTP Cancel Segment Reason Codes

   Section 3.2.4 of [RFC5326] defines the reason codes that may be
   present in Cancel Segments in LTP.  IANA has set up a registry to
   manage the cancel reason codes.  This registry, titled "LTP Cancel
   Segment Reason Codes", has been added to the list of registries
   associated with the Licklider Transmission Protocol.

   The registration policy for this registry is Specification Required.

      +-------+---------------------------------+---------------+

3.1.2.  LTP Engine ID

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has an LTP Engine ID field
   (Section 2 of [RFC5326]).  IANA has set up a registry to manage the
   Engine IDs.  This registry, titled "LTP Engine Numbers", has been
   added to the list of registries associated with the Licklider
   Transmission Protocol.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   1 -- (2**14)-1  Expert Review required.

   (2**14) -- (2**21)-1  Allocated to the Space Assigned Numbers
      Authority ([SANA]) for use by Consultative Committee for Space
      Data Systems (CCSDS) missions.

   (2**21) -- (2**28)-1  Private or Experimental Use.

   (2**28) -- (2**42)-1  First Come First Served basis for requests for
      less than or equal to 2**14 values to a single entity or
      organization.  Expert Review is required for requests of more than
      2**14 values to a single entity or organization.

3.1.3.  LTP Client Service ID

   The Licklider Transmission Protocol has a client service ID number
   field (Section 3.2.1 of [RFC5326]).  IANA has set up a registry to
   manage LTP Client Service IDs.  This registry, titled "LTP Client
   Service Identifiers", has been added to the list of registries
   associated with the Licklider Transmission Protocol.

   The registration policy for this registry is:

   4 -- (2**14)-1  Allocated to the Space Assigned Numbers Authority
      ([SANA]) for use by Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems
      (CCSDS) missions.
