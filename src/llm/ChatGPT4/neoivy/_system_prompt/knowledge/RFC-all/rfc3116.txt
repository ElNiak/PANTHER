Abstract

   This document discusses and defines a number of tests that may be
   used to describe the performance characteristics of ATM (Asynchronous
   Transfer Mode) based switching devices.  In addition to defining the
   tests this document also describes specific formats for reporting the
   results of the tests.

   This memo is a product of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group
   (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

1. Introduction

   This document defines a specific set of tests that vendors can use to
   measure and report the performance characteristics of ATM network
   devices.  The results of these tests will provide the user comparable
   data from different vendors with which to evaluate these devices.
   The methods defined in this memo are based on RFC 2544 "Benchmarking
   Methodology for Network Interconnect Devices".

   The document "Terminology for ATM Benchmarking" (RFC 2761), defines
   many of the terms that are used in this document.  The terminology
   document should be consulted before attempting to make use of this
   document.

   The BMWG produces two major classes of documents: Benchmarking
   Terminology documents and Benchmarking Methodology documents.  The
   Terminology documents present the benchmarks and other related terms.
   The Methodology documents define the procedures required to collect
   the benchmarks cited in the corresponding Terminology documents.

2. Background

2.1. Test Device Requirements

   This document is based on the requirement that a test device is
   available.  The test device can either be off the shelf or can be
   easily built with current technologies.  The test device must have a
   transmitting and receiving port for the interface type under test.
   The test device must be configured to transmit test PDUs and to
   analyze received PDUs.  The test device should be able to transmit
   and analyze received data at the same time.

2.2. Systems Under Test (SUTs)

   There are a number of tests described in this document that do not
   apply to each SUT.  Vendors should perform all of the tests that can
   be supported by a specific product type.  It will take some time to
   perform all of the recommended tests under all of the recommended
   conditions.

2.3. Test Result Evaluation

   Performing all of the tests in this document will result in a great
   deal of data.  The applicability of this data to the evaluation of a
   particular SUT will depend on its expected use and the configuration
   of the network in which it will be used.  For example, the time
   required by a switch to provide ILMI services will not be a pertinent
   measurement in a network that does not use the ILMI protocol, such as
   an ATM WAN.  Evaluating data relevant to a particular network
   installation may require considerable experience, which may not be
   readily available.  Finally, test selection and evaluation of test
   results must be done with an understanding of generally accepted
   testing practices regarding repeatability, variance and the
   statistical significance of a small numbers of trials.

2.4. Requirements

   In this document, the words that are used to define the significance
   of each particular requirement are capitalized.  These words are:

   *  "MUST" This word, or the words "REQUIRED" and "SHALL" mean that
      the item is an absolute requirement of the specification.

   *  "SHOULD" This word or the adjective "RECOMMENDED" means that there
      may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore this
      item, but the full implications should be understood and the case
      carefully weighed before choosing a different course.




Dunn & Martin                Informational                      [Page 5]

RFC 3116            Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           June 2001


   *  "MAY" This word or the adjective "OPTIONAL" means that this item
      is truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item
      because a particular marketplace requires it or because it
      enhances the product, for example; another vendor may omit the
      same item.

   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
   of the MUST requirements for the protocols it implements.  An
   implementation that satisfies all the MUST and all the SHOULD
   requirements for its protocols is said to be "unconditionally
   compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST requirements but not all
   the SHOULD requirements for its protocols is said to be
   "conditionally compliant".

2.5. Test Configurations for SONET

   The test device can be connected to the SUT in a variety of
   configurations depending on the test point.  The following
   configurations will be used for the tests described in this document.

   1) Uni-directional connection: The test devices transmit port
      (labeled Tx) is connected to the SUT receive port (labeled Rx).
      The SUTs transmit port is connected to the test device receive
      port (see Figure 1).  In this configuration, the test device can
      verify that all transmitted packets are acknowledged correctly.
      Note that this configuration does not verify internal system
      functions, but verifies one port on the SUT.

            +-------------+               +-------------+
            |           Tx|-------------->|Rx           |
            |    Test   Rx|<--------------|Tx   SUT     |
            |   Device    |               |             |
            +-------------+               +-------------+

                            Figure 1

   2) Bi-directional connection: The test devices first transmit port is
      connected to the SUTs first receive port.  The SUTs first transmit
      port is connected to the test devices first receive port.  The
      test devices second transmit port is connected to the SUTs second
      receive port.  The SUTs second transmit port is connected to the
      test devices second receive port (see Figure 2).  In this
      configuration, the test device can determine if all of the
      transmitted packets were received and forwarded correctly.  Note
      that this configuration does verify internal system functions,
      since it verifies two ports on the SUT.

      configuration, the test device can determine if all of the packets
      transmitted by SUT1 were correctly acknowledged by SUT2.  Note
      that this configuration does not verify internal system functions,
      but verifies one port on each SUT.

2.6. SUT Configuration

   The SUT MUST be configured as described in the SUT users guide.
   Specifically, it is expected that all of the supported protocols will
   be configured and enabled.  It is expected that all of the tests will
   be run without changing the configuration or setup of the SUT in any
   way other than that required to do the specific test.  For example,
   it is not acceptable to disable all but one transport protocol when
   testing the throughput of that protocol.  If PNNI or BISUP is used to
   initiate switched virtual connections (SVCs), the SUT configuration
   SHOULD include the normally recommended routing update intervals and
   keep alive frequency.  The specific version of the software and the
   exact SUT configuration, including what functions are disabled and
   used during the tests MUST be included as part of the report of the
   results.

2.7. Frame formats

   The formats of the test IP PDUs to use for TCP/IP and UPC/IP over ATM
   are shown in Appendix C: Test Frame Formats.  Note that these IP PDUs
   are in accordance with RFC 2225.  These exact IP PDU formats SHOULD
   be used in the tests described in this document for this
   protocol/media combination.  These IP PDUs will be used as a template
   for testing other protocol/media combinations.  The specific formats
   that are used to define the test IP PDUs for a particular test series
   MUST be included in the report of the results.

2.8. Frame sizes

   All of the described tests SHOULD be performed using a number of IP
   PDU sizes.  Specifically, the sizes SHOULD include the maximum and
   minimum legitimate sizes for the protocol under test on the media
   under test and enough sizes in between to be able to get a full
   characterization of the SUT performance.  Except where noted, at
   least five IP PDU sizes SHOULD be tested for each test condition.

   Theoretically the minimum size UDP Echo request IP PDU would consist
   of an IP header (minimum length 20 octets), a UDP header (8 octets),
   AAL5 trailer (8 octets) and an LLC/SNAP code point header (8 octets);
   therefore, the minimum size PDU will fit into one ATM cell.  The
   theoretical maximum IP PDU size is determined by the size of the
   length field in the IP header.  In almost all cases the actual
   maximum and minimum sizes are determined by the limitations of the
   media.  In the case of ATM, the maximum IP PDU size SHOULD be the ATM
   MTU size, which is 9180 octets.

   In theory it would be ideal to distribute the IP PDU sizes in a way
   that would evenly distribute the theoretical IP PDU rates.  These
   recommendations incorporate this theory but specify IP PDU sizes,
   which are easy to understand and remember.  In addition, many of the
   same IP PDU sizes are specified on each of the media types to allow
   for easy performance comparisons.

   Note: The inclusion of an unrealistically small IP PDU size on some
   of the media types (i.e., with little or no space for data) is to
   help characterize the per-IP PDU processing overhead of the SUT.

   The IP PDU sizes that will be used are:

   44, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 1518, 2048, 4472, 9180

   The minimum size IP PDU for UDP on ATM is 44 octets, the minimum size
   of 44 is recommended to allow direct comparison to token ring
   performance.  The IP PDU size of 4472 is recommended instead of the



Dunn & Martin                Informational                      [Page 8]

RFC 3116            Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           June 2001


   theoretical FDDI maximum size of 4500 octets in order to permit the
   same type of comparison.  An IP (i.e., not UDP) IP PDU may be used in
   addition if a higher data rate is desired, in which case the minimum
   IP PDU size is 28 octets.

2.9. Verifying received IP PDUs

   The test equipment SHOULD discard any IP PDUs received during a test
   run that are not actual forwarded test IP PDUs.  For example, keep-
   alive and routing update IP PDUs SHOULD NOT be included in the count
   of received IP PDUs.  In any case, the test equipment SHOULD verify
   the length of the received IP PDUs and check that they match the
   expected length.

   Preferably, the test equipment SHOULD include sequence numbers in the
   transmitted IP PDUs and check for these numbers on the received IP
   PDUs.  If this is done, the reported results SHOULD include, in
   addition to the number of IP PDUs dropped, the number of IP PDUs that
   were received out of order, the number of duplicate IP PDUs received
   and the number of gaps in the received IP PDU numbering sequence.
   This functionality is required for some of the described tests.

2.10. Modifiers

   It is useful to characterize the SUTs performance under a number of
   conditions.  Some of these conditions are noted below.  The reported
   results SHOULD include as many of these conditions as the test
   equipment is able to generate.  The suite of tests SHOULD be run
   first without any modifying conditions, then repeated under each of
   the modifying conditions separately.  To preserve the ability to
   compare the results of these tests, any IP PDUs that are required to
   generate the modifying conditions (excluding management queries) will
   be included in the same data stream as that of the normal test IP
   PDUs and in place of one of the test IP PDUs.  They MUST not be
   supplied to the SUT on a separate network port.

2.10.1. Management IP PDUs

   Most ATM data networks now make use of ILMI, signaling and OAM.  In
   many environments, there can be a number of management stations
   sending queries to the same SUT at the same time.

   Management queries MUST be made in accordance with the applicable
   specification, e.g., ILMI sysUpTime getNext requests will be made in
   accordance with ILMI 4.0.  The response to the query MUST be verified
   by the test equipment.  Note that, for each management protocol in

RFC 3116            Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           June 2001


   use, this requires that the test equipment implement the associated
   protocol state machine.  One example of the specific query IP PDU
   (ICMP) that should be used is shown in Appendix C.

2.10.2. Routing update IP PDUs

   The processing of PNNI updates could have a significant impact on the
   ability of a switch to forward cells and complete calls.  If PNNI is
   configured on the SUT, one routing update MUST be transmitted before
   the first test IP PDU is transmitted during the trial.  The test
   SHOULD verify that the SUT has properly processed the routing update.

   PNNI routing update IP PDUs SHOULD be sent at the rate specified in
   Appendix B.  Appendix C defines one routing update PDU for the TCP/IP
   over ATM example.  The routing updates are designed to change the
   routing on a number of networks that are not involved in the
   forwarding of the test data.  The first IP PDU sets the routing table
   state to "A", the second one changes the state to "B".  The IP PDUs
   MUST be alternated during the trial.  The test SHOULD verify that the
   SUT has properly processed the routing update.

2.11. Filters

   Filters are added to switches to selectively inhibit the forwarding
   of cells that would normally be forwarded.  This is usually done to
   implement security controls on the data that is accepted between one
   area and another.  Different products have different capabilities to
   implement filters.  Filters are applicable only if the SUT supports
   the filtering feature.

   The SUT SHOULD be first configured to add one filter condition and
   the tests performed.  This filter SHOULD permit the forwarding of the
   test data stream.  This filter SHOULD be of the form as described in
   the SUT Users Guide.

   The SUT SHOULD be then reconfigured to implement a total of 25
   filters.  The first 24 of these filters SHOULD be based on 24
   separate ATM NSAP Network Prefix addresses.

   The 24 ATM NSAP Network Prefix addresses SHOULD not be any that are
   represented in the test data stream.  The last filter SHOULD permit
   the forwarding of the test data stream.  By "first" and "last" we
   mean to ensure that in the second case, 25 conditions must be checked
   before the data IP over ATM PDUs will match the conditions that
   permit the forwarding of the IP PDU.  Of course, if the SUT reorders
   the filters or does not use a linear scan of the filter rules the
   effect of the sequence in which the filters are input is properly
   lost.



Dunn & Martin                Informational                     [Page 10]

RFC 3116            Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           June 2001


   The exact filters configuration command lines used SHOULD be included
   with the report of the results.

2.11.1. Filter Addresses

   Two sets of filter addresses are required, one for the single filter
   case and one for the 25 filter case.

   The single filter case should permit traffic from ATM address [Switch
   Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 to ATM address [Switch Network
   Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 and deny all other traffic.  Note that
   the 13 octet Switch Network Prefix MUST be configured before this
   test can be run.

   The 25 filter case should follow the following sequence.

         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 03 00
         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 04 00
         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 05 00
         ...
         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0C 00
         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0D 00
         allow [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 02 00
         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0E 00
         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 0F 00
          ...
         deny [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
              to [Switch Network Prefix] 00 00 00 00 00 18 00
         deny all else

   All previous filter conditions should be cleared from the switch
   before this sequence is entered.  The sequence is selected to test to
   see if the switch sorts the filter conditions or accepts them in the
   order that they were entered.  Both of these procedures will result
   in a greater impact on performance than will some form of hash
   coding.

2.12. Protocol addresses

   It is easier to implement these tests using a single logical stream
   of data, with one source ATM address and one destination ATM address,
   and for some conditions like the filters described above, a practical
   requirement.  Networks in the real world are not limited to single
   streams of data.  The test suite SHOULD be first run with a single
   ATM source and destination address pair.  The tests SHOULD then be
   repeated with using a random destination address.  In the case of
   testing single switches, the addresses SHOULD be random and uniformly
   distributed over a range of 256 seven octet user parts.  In the case
   of testing multiple interconnected switches, the addresses SHOULD be
   random and uniformly distributed over the 256 network prefixes, each
   of which should support 256 seven octet user parts.  The specific
   address ranges to use for ATM are shown in Appendix A.  IP to ATM
   address mapping MUST be accomplished as described in RFC 2225.

2.13. Route Set Up

   It is not reasonable that all of the routing information necessary to
   forward the test stream, especially in the multiple address case,
   will be manually set up.  If PNNI and/or ILMI are running, at the
   start of each trial a routing update MUST be sent to the SUT.  This
   routing update MUST include all of the ATM addresses that will be
   required for the trial.  This routing update will have to be repeated
   at the interval required by PNNI or ILMI.  An example of the format
   and repetition interval of the update IP PDUs is given in Appendix B
   (interval and size) and Appendix C (format).

2.14. Bidirectional traffic

   Bidirectional performance tests SHOULD be run with the same data rate
   being offered from each direction.  The sum of the data rates should
   not exceed the theoretical limit for the media.

2.15. Single stream path

   The full suite of tests SHOULD be run with the appropriate modifiers
   for a single receive and transmit port on the SUT.  If the internal
   design of the SUT has multiple distinct pathways, for example,
   multiple interface cards each with multiple network ports, then all
   possible permutations of pathways SHOULD be tested separately.  If
   multiple interconnected switches are tested, the test MUST specify
   routes, which allow only one path between source and destination ATM
   addresses.

RFC 3116            Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           June 2001


2.16. Multi-port

   Many switch products provide several network ports on the same
   interface module.  Each port on an interface module SHOULD be
   stimulated in an identical manner.  Specifically, half of the ports
   on each module SHOULD be receive ports and half SHOULD be transmit
   ports.  For example if a SUT has two interface module each of which
   has four ports, two ports on each interface module be receive ports
   and two will be transmit ports.  Each receive port MUST be offered
   the same data rate.  The addresses in the input data streams SHOULD
   be set so that an IP PDU will be directed to each of the transmit
   ports in sequence.  That is, all transmit ports will receive an
   identical distribution of IP PDUs from a particular receive port.

   Consider the following 6 port SUT:

               --------------
      ---------| Rx A   Tx X|--------
      ---------| Rx B   Tx Y|--------
      ---------| Rx C   Tx Z|--------
               --------------

   The addressing of the data streams for each of the inputs SHOULD be:

      stream sent to Rx A:
        IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z
      stream sent to Rx B:
        IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z
      stream sent to Rx C
        IP PDU to Tx X, IP PDU to Tx Y, IP PDU to Tx Z

   Note: Each stream contains the same sequence of IP destination
   addresses; therefore, each transmit port will receive 3 IP PDUs
   simultaneously.  This procedure ensures that the SUT will have to
   process multiple IP PDUs addressed to the same transmit port
   simultaneously.

   The same configuration MAY be used to perform a bi-directional
   multi-stream test.  In this case all of the ports are considered both
   receive and transmit ports.  Each data stream MUST consist of IP PDUs
   whose addresses correspond to the ATM addresses all of the other
   ports.

2.17. Multiple protocols

   This document does not address the issue of testing the effects of a
   mixed protocol environment other than to suggest that if such tests
   are wanted then PDUs SHOULD be distributed between all of the test
   protocols.  The distribution MAY approximate the conditions on the
   network in which the SUT would be used.

2.18. Multiple IP PDU sizes

   This document does not address the issue of testing the effects of a
   mixed IP PDU size environment other than to suggest that, if such
   tests are required, then IP PDU size SHOULD be evenly distributed
   among all of the PDU sizes listed in this document.  The distribution
   MAY approximate the conditions on the network in which the SUT would
   be used.

2.19. Testing beyond a single SUT

   In the performance testing of a single SUT, the paradigm can be
   described as applying some input to a SUT and monitoring the output.
   The results of which can be used to form a basis of characterization
   of that device under those test conditions.

   This model is useful when the test input and output are homogeneous
   (e.g., 64-byte IP, AAL5 PDUs into the SUT; 64 byte IP, AAL5 PDUs
   out).

   By extending the single SUT test model, reasonable benchmarks
   regarding multiple SUTs or heterogeneous environments may be
   collected.  In this extension, the single SUT is replaced by a system
   of interconnected network SUTs.  This test methodology would support
   the benchmarking of a variety of device/media/service/protocol
   combinations.  For example, a configuration for a LAN-to-WAN-to-LAN
   test might be:

      (1) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> BISUP -> SUT 2 -> ATM UNI

   Or an extended LAN configuration might be:

      (2) ATM UNI -> SUT 1 -> PNNI Network -> SUT 2 -> ATM UNI

   In both examples 1 and 2, end-to-end benchmarks of each system could
   be empirically ascertained.  Other behavior may be characterized
   through the use of intermediate devices.  In example 2, the
   configuration may be used to give an indication of the effect of PNNI
   routing on IP throughput.




Dunn & Martin                Informational                     [Page 14]

RFC 3116            Methodology for ATM Benchmarking           June 2001


   Because multiple SUTs are treated as a single system, there are
   limitations to this methodology.  For instance, this methodology may
   yield an aggregate benchmark for a tested system.  That benchmark
   alone, however, may not necessarily reflect asymmetries in behavior
   between the SUTs, latencies introduced by other apparatus (e.g.,
   CSUs/DSUs, switches), etc.

   Further, care must be used when comparing benchmarks of different
   systems by ensuring that the SUTs' features and configuration of the
   tested systems have the appropriate common denominators to allow
   comparison.

2.20. Maximum IP PDU rate

   The maximum IP PDU rates that should be used when testing LAN
   connections SHOULD be the listed theoretical maximum rate for the IP
   PDU size on the media.

   The maximum IP PDU rate that should be used when testing WAN
   connections SHOULD be greater than the listed theoretical maximum
   rate for the IP PDU size on that speed connection.  The higher rate
   for WAN tests is to compensate for the fact that some vendors employ
   various forms of header compression.

   A list of maximum IP PDU rates for LAN connections is included in
   Appendix B.

2.21. Bursty traffic

   It is convenient to measure the SUT performance under steady state
   load; however, this is an unrealistic way to gauge the functioning of
   a SUT.  Actual network traffic normally consists of bursts of IP
   PDUs.

   Some of the tests described below SHOULD be performed with both
   constant bit rate, bursty Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) Best Effort
   [AF-TM4.1] and Variable Bit Rate Non-real Time (VBR-nrt) Best Effort
   [AF-TM4.1].  The IP PDUs within a burst are transmitted with the
   minimum legitimate inter-IP PDU gap.

   The objective of the test is to determine the minimum interval
   between bursts that the SUT can process with no IP PDU loss.  Tests
   SHOULD be run with burst sizes of 10% of Maximum Burst Size (MBS),
   20% of MBS, 50% of MBS and 100% MBS.  Note that the number of IP PDUs
   in each burst will depend on the PDU size.  For UBR, the MBS refers
   to the associated VBR traffic parameters.

2.22. Trial description

   A particular test consists of multiple trials.  Each trial returns
   one piece of information, for example the loss rate at a particular
   input IP PDU rate.  Each trial consists of five of phases:

   a) If the SUT is a switch supporting PNNI, send the routing update to
      the SUT receive port and wait two seconds to be sure that the
      routing has settled.

   b) Send an ATM ARP PDU to determine the ATM address corresponding to
      the destination IP address.  The formats of the ATM ARP PDU that
      should be used are shown in the Test Frame Formats document and
      MUST be in accordance with RFC 2225.

   c) Stimulate SUT with traffic load.

   d) Wait for two seconds for any residual IP PDUs to be received.

   e) Wait for at least five seconds for the SUT to restabilize.

2.23. Trial duration

   The objective of the tests defined in this document is to accurately
   characterize the behavior of a particular piece of network equipment
   under varying traffic loads.  The choice of test duration must be a
   compromise between this objective and keeping the duration of the
   benchmarking test suite within reasonable bounds.  The SUT SHOULD be
   stimulated for at least 60 seconds.  If this time period results in a
   high variance in the test results, the SUT SHOULD be stimulated for
   at least 300 seconds.

2.24. Address resolution

   The SUT MUST be able to respond to address resolution requests sent
   by another SUT, an ATM ARP server or the test equipment in accordance
   with RFC 2225.

2.25. Synchronized Payload Bit Pattern.

   Some measurements assume that both the transmitter and receiver
   payload information is synchronized.  Synchronization MUST be
   achieved by supplying a known bit pattern to both the transmitter and
   receiver.  This bit pattern MUST be one of the following: PRBS-15,
   PRBS-23, 0xFF00, or 0xAA55.

2.26. Burst Traffic Descriptors.

   Some measurements require busty traffic patterns.  These patterns
   MUST conform to one of the following traffic descriptors:

1) PCR=100% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

2) PCR=100% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

3) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

4) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=50% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

5) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=45% allotted line rate, and MBS=8192

6) PCR=90% allotted line rate, SCR=45% allotted line rate, and MBS=4096

7) PCR=80% allotted line rate, SCR=40% allotted line rate, and MBS=65536

8) PCR=80% allotted line rate, SCR=40% allotted line rate, and MBS=32768

   The allotted line rate refers to the total available line rate
   divided by the number of VCCs in use.

3.1.1. Pointer Movements

   Objective: To determine that the SUT does not propagate pointer

3.2.1. Two-Point Cell Delay Variation (CDV)

3.2.1.1. Test Setup

   The cell delay measurements assume that both the transmitter and
   receiver timestamp information is synchronized.  Synchronization
   SHOULD be achieved by supplying a common clock signal (minimum of 100
   Mhz or 10 ns resolution) to both the transmitter and receiver.  The
   maximum timestamp values MUST be recorded to ensure synchronization
   in the case of counter rollover.  The cell delay measurements SHOULD
   utilize the O.191 cell (ITUT-O.191) encapsulated in a valid IP
   packet.  If the O.191 cell is not available, a test cell encapsulated
   in a valid IP packet MAY be used.  The test cell MUST contain a
   transmit timestamp which can be correlated with a receive timestamp.
   A description of the test cell MUST be included in the test results.
   The description MUST include the timestamp length (in bits), counter
   rollover value, and the timestamp accuracy (in ns).

       VBR, or UBR connection.  The VPI/VCI MUST not be one of the
       reserved ATM signaling channels (e.g., [0,5], [0,16]).

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing timestamps at a
       specific constant rate through the SUT via the defined test VCC.

      and minimum CDV during the test in us, and peak-to-peak CDV in us.

      The graph results SHOULD display the cell delay values.  The x-
      coordinate SHOULD be the test run time in either seconds, minutes
      or days depending on the total length of the test.  The x-
      coordinate time SHOULD be configurable.  The y-coordinate SHOULD
      be the cell delay in us.  The integration time per point MUST be
      indicated.

      The histogram results SHOULD display the peak-to-peak cell delay.
      The x-coordinate SHOULD be the cell delay in us with at least 256
      bins.  The y-coordinate SHOULD be the number of cells observed in
      each bin.

      The results MUST also indicate the packet size in octets, traffic
      rate in packets per second, and bearer class as generated by the
      test device.  The VCC and VPI/VCI values MUST be indicated.  The

3.2.2. Cell Error Ratio (CER)

3.2.2.1. Test Setup

   The cell error ratio measurements assume that both the transmitter
   and receiver payload information is synchronized.  Synchronization
   MUST be achieved by supplying a known bit pattern to both the
   transmitter and receiver.  If this bit pattern is longer than the
   packet size, the receiver MUST synchronize with the transmitter
   before tests can be run.

3.2.6.3. CTD/Steady Load/Twelve VCCs

   Objective: To determine the SUT variation in cell transfer delay with
   twelve VCCs as defined in RFC 2761 "Terminology for ATM
   Benchmarking".

   Procedure:

   1)  Set up the SUT and test device using the bi-directional
       configuration.

   2)  Configure the SUT and test device with twelve VCCs, using 1 VPI
       and 12 VCIs.  The VCC's MUST be configured as either a CBR, VBR,
       or UBR connection.  The VPI/VCIs MUST not be one of the reserved
       ATM signaling channels (e.g., [0,5], [0,16]).

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing timestamps at a
       specific constant rate through the SUT via the defined test VCCs.
       All of the VPI/VCI pairs will generate traffic at the same
       traffic rate.  Since this test is not a throughput test, the rate
       should not be greater than 90% of line rate.  The IP PDUs MUST be
       encapsulated in AAL5.

   4)  Count the IP packets that are transmitted by the SUT on all VCCs
       to verify connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device
       is the same on the SUT, continue the test; else lower the test
       device traffic rate until the counts are the same.

   5)  Record the packets timestamps at the transmitter and receiver
       ends of the test device for all VCCs.

   Objective: To determine if the SUT will drop IP packets due AAL5 Re-
   assembly Errors as defined in RFC 2761 "Terminology for ATM

   Procedure:

   1)  Set up the SUT and test device using the uni-directional
       configuration.

   2)  Send a specific number of cells at a specific rate through the
       SUT.  Since this test is not a throughput test, the rate should
       not be greater than 90% of line rate.  The cell payload SHOULD
       contain valid IP PDUs.  The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   3)  Count the cells that are transmitted by the SUT to verify
       connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device is the
       same on the SUT, continue the test; else lower the test device
       traffic rate until the counts are the same.

   2)  Send a specific number of IP packets at a specific rate through
       the SUT.  Since this test is not a throughput test, the rate
       should not be greater than 90% of line rate.  The IP PDUs MUST be
       encapsulated in AAL5.  The AAL5 PDU size is 65535 octets or 1365
       ATM cells.

       connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device is the
       same on the SUT, continue the test; else lower the test device
       traffic rate until the counts are the same.

   4)  Given an AAL5 reassembly timer of 'x' seconds, where 'x' is the
       actual value of the AAL5 reassembly timer on the SUT, sent
       traffic at 1365 cells per 'x' seconds.  The expected results are
       that no AAL5 PDU's will be dropped.

   5)  Send traffic at 1360 cells per 'x' seconds.  The expected results
       are that all AAL5 PDU's will be dropped.

   Reporting Format:

      The results of the IP packet loss due to AAL5 reassembly timeout
      test SHOULD be reported in a form of a table.  The rows SHOULD be

3.3.3.1. Test Setup

   The AAL5 CRC error ratio measurements assume that both the
   transmitter and receiver payload information is synchronized.
   Synchronization MUST be achieved by supplying a known bit pattern to

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing one of the
       specified bit patterns at a constant rate through the SUT via the

       connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device is the
       same on the SUT, continue the test; else lower the test device
       traffic rate until the counts are the same.

   relation to the total AAL5 PDU's sent as defined in RFC 2761
   "Terminology for ATM Benchmarking".

   Procedure:

   1)  Set up the SUT and test device using the bi-directional
       configuration.

       connection.  The VPI/VCIs MUST not be one of the reserved ATM
       signaling channels (e.g., [0,5], [0,16]).

   3)  Send a specific number of IP packets containing one of the
       specified bit patterns at a constant rate through the SUT via the
       defined test VCCs.  All of the VPI/VCI pairs will generate
       traffic at the same traffic rate.  Since this test is not a
       throughput test, the rate should not be greater than 90% of line
       rate.  The IP PDUs MUST be encapsulated in AAL5.

   4)  Count the IP packets that are transmitted by the SUT on all VCCs
       to verify connectivity and load.  If the count on the test device

   Notes: 1.  PDU size in cells is computed based on ceiling( ( PDU size
   in octets + 16) / 48).  This assumes an 8 octet LLC/SNAP header and
   an 8 octet AAL/5 trailer.

   2.  Due to the number of possible configurations, IMA pps rates are
   not listed, but may be derived from the following formula: floor
   (IDCR/cells per packet), where cells per packet is computed as in
   note 1.
