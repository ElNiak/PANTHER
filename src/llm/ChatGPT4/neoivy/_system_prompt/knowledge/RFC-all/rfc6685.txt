RFC 6685                   IODEF XML Registry                  July 2012


1.  Introduction

   IODEF extensions via class extension through AdditionalData and
   RecordItem elements, per Section 5.2 of [RFC5070], generally register
   their namespaces and schemas with the IANA XML Namespace registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/ns.html and the IANA XML
   Schema registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html,
   respectively [RFC3688].

   In addition to schema reviews required by IANA, these registry
   requests should be accompanied by a review by IODEF experts to ensure
   the specified AdditionalData and/or RecordItem contents are
   compatible with IODEF and with other existing IODEF extensions.  This
   document specifies that review.

2.  Expert Review of IODEF-Related XML Registry Entries

   Changes to the XML Schema registry for schema names beginning with
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:iodef" are subject to an additional IODEF
   Expert Review [RFC5226] for IODEF correctness and appropriateness.

   The IODEF expert(s) for these reviews will be designated by the IETF
   Security Area Directors.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document has no security considerations.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies additional expert reviews for IODEF
   extensions, on the XML Schema registry
   (http://www.iana.org/assignments/xml-registry/schema.html), in
   Section 2.
