    IANA Registry Update for Support of the SEED Cipher Algorithm in
                   Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY)

Abstract

   This document updates IANA registries to support the SEED block
   cipher algorithm for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
   and the secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP) in
   Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY).

1.  Introduction

   This document updates IANA registries to support the SEED [RFC4269]
   block cipher algorithm for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
   (SRTP) and the Secure Real-time Transport Control Protocol (SRTCP)
   [RFC3711] in Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) [RFC3830].

1.1.  SEED

   SEED is a 128-bit symmetric key block cipher that has been developed
   by KISA (Korea Information Security Agency) and a group of experts
   since 1998.  The input/output block size of SEED is 128-bit, and the
   key length is also 128-bit.  SEED has a 16-round Feistel structure.

   SEED is a Korean National Industrial Association standard and is
   widely used in South Korea for electronic commerce and various
   security products such as firewalls, VPNs, and so on.

2.  Additions to MIKEY Payload

   This section specifies new code points for the MIKEY [RFC3830]
   payload to indicate the use of the SEED cipher algorithm for SRTP and
   SRTCP.  There are three applicable modes of running SEED: SEED in
   Counter Mode (SEED-CTR), SEED in Counter with CBC-MAC Mode (SEED-
   CCM), and SEED in Galois/Counter Mode (SEED-GCM) Mode.  These are
   defined in [RFC5669].

RFC 5748                       MIKEY_SEED                    August 2010


2.1.  Modified Table 6.10.1.b from RFC 3830

   IANA has amended the sub-registry derived from Table 6.10.1.b of
   [RFC3830] as follows:

               SRTP encr alg | Value
               ---------------------
               NULL          |     0
               AES-CM        |     1
               AES-F8        |     2
               SEED-CTR      |     3 (NEW)
               SEED-CCM      |     4 (NEW)
               SEED-GCM      |     5 (NEW)

             Figure 1: Table 6.10.1.b from [RFC3830] (Revised)

2.2.  Modified Table 6.10.1.d from RFC 3830

   IANA has amended the sub-registry derived from Table 6.10.1.d of
   [RFC3830] as follows:

               SRTP PRF      | Value
               ---------------------
               AES-CM        |     0
               SEED-CTR      |     1 (NEW)

             Figure 2: Table 6.10.1.d from [RFC3830] (Revised)

3.  Security Considerations

   No security problem has been found on SEED.  SEED is secure against
   all known attacks including differential cryptanalysis, linear
   cryptanalysis, and related key attacks.  The only known attack is an
   exhaustive search for the key.  For further security considerations,
   the reader is encouraged to read [SEED-EVAL].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has amended the indicated sub-registries in Section 2 of the
   MIKEY [RFC3830] Payload Name registry according to Sections 2.1 and
   2.2 above.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank David McGrew, Spencer Dawkins,
   SangHwan Park, Brian Weis, and Tim Polk for their reviews and
   support.
