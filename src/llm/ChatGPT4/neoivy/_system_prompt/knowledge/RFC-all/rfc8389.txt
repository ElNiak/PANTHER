1.  Introduction

   Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation (MAP-E) [RFC7597] is a
   stateless, automatic tunneling mechanism for providing an IPv4
   connectivity service to end users over a service provider's IPv6
   network.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with monitoring MAP-E devices.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The IF-MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for managing
   interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual) has an
   ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical interface
   (ifEntry) for each tunnel.  Each MAP-E tunnel endpoint also acts as a
   virtual interface that has a corresponding entry in the IF-MIB.
   Those corresponding entries are indexed by ifIndex.  The MAP-E MIB is
   configurable on a per-interface basis, so it depends on several parts
   (ifEntry) of the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

4.1.  The mapMIBObjects

4.1.1.  The mapRule Subtree

   The mapRule subtree describes managed objects used for managing the
   multiple mapping rules in MAP-E.

   According to [RFC7597], the mapping rules are divided into two
   categories: Basic Mapping Rule (BMR) and Forwarding Mapping Rule
   (FMR).  According to Section 4.1 of [RFC7598], an F-flag specifies
   whether the rule is to be used for forwarding (FMR).  If set, this
   rule is used as an FMR; if not set, this rule is BMR only and MUST
   NOT be used for forwarding.  A BMR can also be used as an FMR for
   forwarding if the F-flag is set.  So, the RuleType definition in the
   MAP-E MIB (see Section 5) defines bmrAndfmr to specify this scenario.

4.1.2.  The mapSecurityCheck Subtree

   The mapSecurityCheck subtree provides statistics for the number of
   invalid packets that have been identified.  [RFC7597] defines two
   kinds of invalid packets:

   o  The Border Relay (BR) will validate the received packet's source
      IPv6 address against the configured MAP domain rule and the
      destination IPv6 address against the configured BR IPv6 address.

   o  The MAP node (Customer Edge (CE) and BR) will check that the
      received packet's source IPv4 address and port are in the range
      derived from the matching MAP rule.

4.2.  The mapMIBConformance Subtree

   The mapMIBConformance subtree provides conformance information of MIB
   objects.

5.  Definitions

   The following MIB module imports definitions from [RFC2578],
   [RFC2579], [RFC2580], [RFC2863], and [RFC4001].

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------
         MAP-E-MIB          { mib-2 242 }

7.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   Some of the objects in this MIB module may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  This includes INDEX objects
   with a MAX-ACCESS of not-accessible, and any indices from other
   modules exposed via AUGMENTS.  It is thus important to control even
   GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
   network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      mapRuleIPv6Prefix

      mapRuleIPv6PrefixLen

      mapRuleIPv4Prefix

      mapRuleIPv4PrefixLen

      mapRuleBRIPv6Address

      mapRulePSID

      mapRulePSIDLen

      mapRuleOffset

      mapRuleEALen

      mapRuleType






Fu, et al.                   Standards Track                   [Page 12]

RFC 8389                        MAP-E MIB                  December 2018


   Some of the MIB model's objects are vulnerable because the
   information that they hold may be used for targeting an attack
   against a MAP node (CE or BR).  For example, an intruder could use
   the information to help deduce the customer IPv4 and IPv6 topologies
   and address-sharing ratios in use by the ISP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
