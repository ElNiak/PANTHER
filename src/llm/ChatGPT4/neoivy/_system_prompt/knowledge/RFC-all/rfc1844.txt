             Multimedia E-mail (MIME) User Agent checklist

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document presents a checklist to facilitate evaluation of MIME
   capable User Agents. Access to a MIME test-responder, that generates
   test-messages is described.

Introduction

   This document presents a checklist that facilitates evaluation of
   MIME capable E-mail User Agents. It is by no means a conformance or
   interoperability (both strictly defined and measurable quantities)
   checklist, but rather an interworking (practical perspective)
   checklist that is aimed at the users and system managers.

Usage and submission

   If you use this checklist against a specific product (regardless of
   whether you're a vendor, implementor or user) you can submit the
   result to mime-check@nic.surfnet.nl, make sure that the subject
   reflects the name and version of the product. This is an automated
   mailhandler, so PLEASE only submit filled-in checklists (in content-
   type text/plain or text/html) to this address. This information will
   be made available (at no cost) for other people to browse through at
   URL: http://www.nic.surfnet.nl/surfnet/projects/surf-ace/mime/

   Although SURFnet will attempt to verify the correctness of each
   submission, all submitted information is made available as is, with
   no guarantees (SURFnet does not take any responsibility for errors in
   the data that is made available, or for any damages resulting from
   usage of that data). Users who want to procure a UA are advised to
   use the data as an orientation, and to perform their own procurement
   tests (possibly using the checklist below as a guideline). Also it is
   noted that vendors and implementors are encouraged to use the results
   from the checklist to improve their products.

Getting test messages

   For several tests in the checklist a test message is required. Test
   messages can be requested in the following way: Send mail to <mime-
   test@relay.surfnet.nl> with a subject field containing ONE of the
   following:

   text/plain
   text/enriched
   image/gif
   image/jpeg
   audio/basic
   video/mpeg
   application/octet-stream
   application/postscript
   message/rfc822
   message/partial
   message/external
   multipart/mixed
   multipart/parallel
   multipart/digest
   multipart/alternative
   multipart/appledouble
   application/wordperfect5.1
   application/msword
   application/rtf
   X-local      <to test how your UA deals with undefined content-types>
   nested    <returns a message that contains nested multipart contents>
   iso-8859-1    <returns a message with text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1>

   A message containing the requested content-type will be returned to
   the address contained in the from field.

       configuration) and/or per user?
   2.2 Are there facilities for logging and/or accounting?
   2.3 Does the UA generate correct RFC-822 headers for outgoing
       messages:
       From:, (and if necessary) Sender:
       Date:
       Message-id:
   2.4 Is it possible for a non-priviledged user to change the
       "from" and/or "sender" field?

       - Displaying a MIME message that contains an image
       - Complex actions like sorting etc.

RFC 1844               MIME User Agent Checklist             August 1995


   4.11 With the content type text/plain it is possible to have a
        charset parameter, indicating that a specific character set is
        used in the content type text plain. What character sets (like
        iso-8859-1) does the UA support (standard or configurable)?

Security Considerations

   Testing a MIME UA against this checklist involves the security risks
   that are described in the MIME specification (RFC 1521). Most notably
   the automatic execution of general-purpose PostScript interpreters
   entails serious security risks. The reader is encouraged to read RFC
   1521 for more detail on these security risks.
