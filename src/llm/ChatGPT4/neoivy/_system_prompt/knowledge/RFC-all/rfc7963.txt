            RSVP-TE Extension for Additional Signal Types in
                G.709 Optical Transport Networks (OTNs)

Abstract

   RFCs 4328 and 7139 provide signaling extensions in Resource
   ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to control the
   full set of Optical Transport Network (OTN) features.  However, these
   specifications do not cover the additional Optical channel Data Unit
   (ODU) containers defined in G.Sup43 (ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2).
   This document defines new Signal Types for these additional
   containers.

RFC 7963       RSVP-TE Ext for Signal Types in G.709 OTNs    August 2016


1.  Introduction

   [RFC7139] updates the portions of text related to the Optical channel
   Data Unit (ODU) described in [RFC4328] to provide extensions to
   Resource ReserVation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) to
   support control for [G.709-v3] in the OTN-TDM SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-
   TDM FLOWSPEC objects.  However, it does not specify Signal Types for
   the ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2 containers defined in [G.Sup43].  This
   document provides RSVP-TE signaling extensions to support these
   additional Signal Types.

   These containers are non-standard data-plane frame formats (not
   defined in ITU-T Recommendations).  They are among some of the intra-
   domain approaches used in networks to transport 10GBASE-R signals in
   optical transport networks.  As a supplement, [G.Sup43] does not
   guarantee interoperability in the data plane for these containers.

2.  RSVP-TE Extension for Additional Signal Types

   [RFC7139] defines the format of Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM
   SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects.  These traffic parameters
   have a Signal Type field.  This document defines the Signal Types for
   ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2, as defined in the IANA Considerations
   section.  They are allocated via the Specification Required policy
   added to the subregistry by [RFC7892].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues
   beyond those identified in [RFC7139].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching
   (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters" registry that contains the "OTN Signal
   Type" subregistry.  IANA has added the following three allocations
   for ODU1e, ODU3e1, and ODU3e2 in the subregistry via the
   Specification Required policy [RFC5226]:

   Value            Type
   -----            ----
   23               ODU1e  (10Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])
   26               ODU3e1 (40Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])
   27               ODU3e2 (40Gbps Ethernet [G.Sup43])

   These Signal Types are carried in the Traffic Parameters in OTN-TDM
   SENDER_TSPEC and OTN-TDM FLOWSPEC objects [RFC7139].
