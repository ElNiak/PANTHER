              Registering Values of the SDP 'proto' Field
     for Transporting RTP Media over TCP under Various RTP Profiles

Abstract

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) specification establishes a
   registry of profile names for use by higher-level control protocols,
   such as the Session Description Protocol (SDP), to refer to the
   transport methods.  This specification describes the following new
   SDP transport protocol identifiers for transporting RTP Media over
   TCP: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF',
   'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP', and
   'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF'.

1.  Overview

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides end-to-end network
   transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time
   data such as audio or video over multicast or unicast network
   services.  The data transport is augmented by the RTP Control
   Protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner
   scalable to large multicast networks and to provide minimal control
   and identification functionality.

   "SDP: Session Description Protocol" [RFC4566] provides a general-
   purpose format for describing multimedia sessions in announcements or
   invitations.  "TCP-Based Media Transport in the Session Description
   Protocol (SDP)" [RFC4145] specifies a general mechanism for
   describing media transport over TCP using SDP with [RFC4571] defining
   a method for framing RTP and RTCP packets [RFC3550] onto a
   connection-oriented transport (such as TCP).  "Connection-Oriented
   Media Transport over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP)" [RFC4572] extends [RFC4145]
   for describing TCP-based media streams that are protected using TLS
   [RFC5246].

   This specification describes additional SDP transport protocol
   identifiers for transporting RTP media over TCP as defined in
   Section 3.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Protocol Identifiers

   The "m=" line in SDP specifies, among other items, the transport
   protocol (identified via the "proto" field) to be used for the media
   in the session.  See Section 5.14 (Media Descriptions) of SDP
   [RFC4566] for a discussion on transport protocol identifiers.

   The following is the format for an "m=" line, as specified in
   [RFC4566]:

             m=<media> <port> <proto> <fmt> ...

3.1.  TCP/RTP/AVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/AVPF transport describes RTP media with RTCP-based
   feedback [RFC4585] over TCP.

   The RTP/AVPF stream over TCP is realized using the framing method
   defined in [RFC4571].

3.2.  TCP/RTP/SAVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/SAVP transport describes Secure RTP (SRTP) media
   [RFC3711] over TCP.

   The RTP/SAVP stream over TCP is realized using the framing method
   defined in [RFC4571].

3.3.  TCP/RTP/SAVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/RTP/SAVPF transport describes Secure RTP media with RTCP-
   based feedback [RFC5124] over TCP.

   The RTP/SAVPF stream over TCP is realized using the framing method
   defined in [RFC4571].

3.4.  TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP transport describes Secure RTP media [RFC3711]
   using Datagram Transport Layer Security SRTP (DTLS-SRTP) [RFC5764]
   over TCP.

RFC 7850                SDP 'proto' Registrations             April 2016


   RTP/SAVP using DTLS-based key establishment is realized according to
   the procedures defined in [RFC5764].  Also, the framing specified in
   [RFC4571] is used to transport DTLS-SRTP packets over TCP.

3.5.  TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF transport describes Secure RTP media with
   RTCP-based feedback [RFC5124] using DTLS-SRTP over TCP.

   RTP/SAVPF using DTLS-based key establishment is realized according to
   the procedures defined in [RFC5764].  Also, the framing specified in
   [RFC4571] is used to transport DTLS-SRTP packets over TCP.

3.6.  TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP Transport Realization

   The TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP transport describes RTP Media on top of TLS over
   TCP.

   RTP/AVP packets are framed using the procedures from [RFC4571] and
   are transported as application data messages over the TLS association
   setup using the procedures from [RFC4572].

3.7.  TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF Transport Realization

   The TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF transport describes RTP media with RTCP-based
   feedback [RFC5124] on top of TLS over TCP.

   RTP/AVPF packets are framed using the procedures from [RFC4571] and
   are transported as application data messages over the TLS association
   setup using the procedures from [RFC4572].

4.  ICE Considerations

   When procedures from [RFC6544] are used to set up Interactive
   Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] candidates for a TCP
   transport, the framing mechanism from [RFC4571] MUST be used for
   framing Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) packets (for
   keepalives and consent checks), as defined in Section 3 of [RFC6544].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification describes the following new SDP transport protocol
   identifiers: 'TCP/RTP/AVPF', 'TCP/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/RTP/SAVPF',
   'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVP', 'TCP/DTLS/RTP/SAVPF', 'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP', and
   'TCP/TLS/RTP/AVPF', as defined in Section 3.  These values have been
   registered by the IANA under the "proto" subregistry in the "Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   The new "proto" identifiers registered by this document in the SDP
   parameters registry maintained by IANA are primarily for use by the
   offer/answer model of the Session Description Protocol [RFC3264] for
   the negotiation and establishment of RTP-based media over the TCP
   transport.  This specification doesn't introduce any additional
   security considerations beyond those specified by the individual
   transport protocols identified in the "proto" identifiers and those
   detailed in Section 7 of [RFC4566].
