1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 [RFC7296] can use
   arbitrary signature algorithms as described in [RFC7427].  [RFC7427]
   defines the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification where each side of
   the IKE negotiation lists its supported hash algorithms.  This
   assumes that all signature schemes involve a hashing phase followed
   by a signature phase.  This made sense because most signature
   algorithms either cannot sign messages bigger than their key or
   truncate messages bigger than their key.

   EdDSA [RFC8032] defines signature methods that do not require
   prehashing of the message.  Unlike other methods, these accept
   messages of arbitrary size, so no prehashing is required.  These
   methods are called Ed25519 and Ed448; they use the Edwards 25519 and
   the Edwards 448 ("Goldilocks") curves, respectively.  Although that
   document also defines prehashed versions of these algorithms, those
   versions are not recommended for protocols where there is minimal
   burden in buffering the entire message so as to make it practical to
   make two passes over the message.  This is true of IKEv2.  See
   Section 8.5 of [RFC8032] for that recommendation.

   EdDSA defines the binary format of the signatures that should be used
   in the "Signature Value" field of the Authentication Data Format in
   Section 3 of RFC 8032.  [RFC8410] defines the object identifiers
   (OIDs) for these signature methods.  For convenience, these OIDs are
   repeated in Appendix A.

   In order to signal within IKE that no hashing needs to be done, we
   define a new value in the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification to
   indicate that no hashing is performed.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The "Identity" Hash Identifier

   This document defines a new value called "Identity" (5) in the "IKEv2
   Hash Algorithms" registry for use in the SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS
   notification.  Inserting this new value into the notification
   indicates that the receiver supports at least one signature algorithm
   that accepts messages of arbitrary size such as Ed25519 and Ed448.

   Ed25519 and Ed448 are only defined with the "Identity" hash and MUST
   NOT be sent to a receiver that has not indicated support for the
   "Identity" hash.

   The prehashed versions of Ed25519 and Ed448 (Ed25519ph and Ed448ph,
   respectively) MUST NOT be used in IKE.

3.  Security Considerations

   The new "Identity" value is needed only for signature algorithms that
   accept an input of arbitrary size.  It MUST NOT be used if none of
   the supported and configured algorithms have this property.  On the
   other hand, there is no good reason to prehash the inputs where the
   signature algorithm has that property.  For this reason,
   implementations MUST have the "Identity" value in the
   SIGNATURE_HASH_ALGORITHMS notification when EdDSA is supported and
   configured.  Implementations SHOULD NOT have other hash algorithms in
   the notification if all supported and configured signature algorithms
   have this property.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the value 5 for the algorithm with the name
   "Identity" in the "IKEv2 Hash Algorithms" registry with this document
   as reference.
