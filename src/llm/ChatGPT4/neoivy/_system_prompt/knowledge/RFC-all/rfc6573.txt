                 The Item and Collection Link Relations

Abstract

   RFC 5988 standardized a means of indicating the relationships between
   resources on the Web. This specification defines a pair of reciprocal
   link relation types that may be used to express the relationship
   between a collection and its members.

RFC 6573         The Item and Collection Link Relations       April 2012


1.  Introduction

   RFC 5988 standardized a means of indicating the relationships between
   resources on the Web. This specification defines a pair of reciprocal
   link relation types that may be used to express the relationship
   between a collection and its members.

   These link relation types can be applied to a wide range of use cases
   across multiple media types.  For example, the 'collection' and
   'item' link relation types are used in these media types:

   1.  OpenSearch 1.1: see Section 4.5.4.1 of [OpenSearch]

   2.  Maze+XML: see [Maze]

   3.  Collection+JSON: see [CollectionJSON]

2.  Link Relations

   The following link relations are defined.

2.1.  'item'

   When included in a resource that represents a collection, the 'item'
   link relation identifies a target resource that represents a member
   of that collection.

   For example, if a resource represents a catalog of products, that
   same representation may include one or more links to resources that
   represent members of that catalog.

   <html>
   ...
     <h1>Product Group X Listing</h1>
     ...
     <a href="..." rel="item">View Product X001</a>
     <a href="..." rel="item">View Product X002</a>
     ...
   </html>

   or, in the case of a Link Header field

   Link: <...>; rel="item"; title="View Product X001"
   Link: <...>; rel="item"; title="View Product X002"

2.2.  'collection'

   When included in a resource that represents a member of a collection,
   the 'collection' link relation identifies a target resource that
   represents a collection of which the context resource is a member.

   For example, if a resource represents a single product in a catalog,
   that same representation may include a link to a resource that
   represents a product group to which this single product belongs:

   <a href="..." rel="collection">Return to Product Group X</a>

   or, in the case of a Link Header field

   Link: <...>; rel="collection"; title="Return to Product Group X"

   Since it is possible that a resource could be a member of multiple
   collections, multiple 'collection' link relations may appear within
   the same representation:

   <a href="..." rel="collection">View other widgets</a>
   <a href="..." rel="collection">View all discontinued items</a>

   The target resource representation need not be restricted to
   representing a list.  It may simply be a document that provides
   details on the collection of which the context resource is a member:

   Link: <...>; rel="collection";
         title="Shakespeare's Collected Works - A History"

   It should also be noted that the same link might represent an 'item'
   in one collection as well as a 'collection' itself.  In this case,
   both link relation values can be applied to the same link:

   Link: <...>; rel="collection item";
         title="A Review of Issac Asimov's Collected Works - Vol. I"

3.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the 'collection' and 'item' link relations below
   as per [RFC5988].

3.1.  'item' Link Relation Registration

   Relation Name:

      item

RFC 6573         The Item and Collection Link Relations       April 2012


   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource that is a member of the
      collection represented by the context IRI.

   Reference:

      See Section 2

3.2.  'collection' Link Relation Registration

   Relation Name:

      collection

   Description:

      The target IRI points to a resource that represents the collection
      resource for the context IRI.

   Reference:

      See Section 2

4.  Security Considerations

   The two link relation types defined in this document do not introduce
   any new security issues to those which are discussed in Section 7 of
   RFC5988 [RFC5988].

5.  Internationalisation Considerations

   The 'item' and 'collection' link relation types do not have any
   internationalization considerations other than those which are
   discussed in Section 8 of RFC5988 [RFC5988].
