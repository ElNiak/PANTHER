                 A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG module for alarm management.  It
   includes functions for alarm-list management, alarm shelving, and
   notifications to inform management systems.  There are also
   operations to manage the operator state of an alarm and
   administrative alarm procedures.  The module carefully maps to
   relevant alarm standards.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG module [RFC7950] for alarm management.
   The purpose is to define a standardized alarm interface for network
   devices that can be easily integrated into management applications.
   The model is also applicable as a northbound alarm interface in the
   management applications.

   Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
   Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the network
   services or necessarily point to the root cause.  However, being able
   to feed alarms to the alarm-management application in a standardized
   format is a starting point for performing higher-level network
   assurance tasks.

   The design of the module is based on experience from using and
   implementing available alarm standards from ITU [X.733], 3GPP
   [ALARMIRP], and ANSI [ISA182].

1.1.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms are defined in [RFC7950]:

   o  action

   o  client

   o  data tree

   o  server

   The following terms are used within this document:

   Alarm (the general concept):  An alarm signifies an undesirable state
      in a resource that requires corrective action.

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   Fault:  A fault is the underlying cause of an undesired behavior.
      There is no trivial one-to-one mapping between faults and alarms.
      One fault may result in several alarms in case the system lacks
      root-cause and correlation capabilities.  An alarm might not have
      an underlying fault as a cause.  For example, imagine a bad Mean
      Opinion Score (MOS) alarm from a Voice over IP (VOIP) probe and
      the cause being non-optimal QoS configuration.

   Alarm Type:  An alarm type identifies a possible unique alarm state
      for a resource.  Alarm types are names to identify the state like
      "link-alarm", "jitter-violation", and "high-disk-utilization".

   Resource:  A fine-grained identification of the alarming resource,
      for example, an interface and a process.

   Alarm Instance:  The alarm state for a specific resource and alarm
      type, for example, ("GigabitEthernet0/15", "link-alarm").  An
      entry in the alarm list.

   Cleared Alarm:  A cleared alarm is an alarm where the system
      considers the undesired state to be cleared.  Operators cannot
      clear alarms; clearance is managed by the system.  For example, a
      "linkUp" notification can be considered a clear condition for a
      "linkDown" state.

   Closed Alarm:  Operators can close alarms irrespective of the alarm
      being cleared or not.  A closed alarm indicates that the alarm
      does not need attention because either the corrective action has
      been taken or it can be ignored for other reasons.

   Alarm Inventory:  A list of all possible alarm types on a system.

   Alarm Shelving:  Blocking alarms according to specific criteria.

   Corrective Action:  An action taken by an operator or automation
      routine in order to minimize the impact of the alarm or resolve
      the root cause.

   Management System:  The alarm-management application that consumes
      the alarms, i.e., acts as a client.

   System:  The system that implements this YANG module, i.e., acts as a
      server.  This corresponds to a network device or a management
      application that provides a northbound alarm interface.

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

2.  Objectives

   The objectives for the design of the alarm data model are:

   o  Users find it simple to use.  If a system supports this module, it
      shall be straightforward to integrate it into a YANG-based alarm
      manager.

   o  Alarms are viewed as states on resources and not as discrete
      notifications.

   o  A precise definition of "alarm" is provided in order to exclude
      general events that should not be forwarded as alarm
      notifications.

   o  Precise identification of alarm types and alarm instances is
      provided.

   o  A management system should be able to pull all available alarm
      types from a system, i.e., read the alarm inventory from a system.
      This makes it possible to prepare alarm operators with
      corresponding alarm instructions.

   o  Alarm-usability requirements are addressed; see Appendix G.  While
      IETF and telecom standards have addressed alarms mostly from a
      protocol perspective, the process industry has published several
      relevant standards addressing requirements for a useful alarm
      interface; see [EEMUA] and [ISA182].  This document defines
      usability requirements as well as a YANG data model.

   o  Mapping to [X.733], which is a requirement for some alarm systems,
      is achievable.  Still, keep some of the X.733 concepts out of the
      core model in order to make the model small and easy to
      understand.

3.  Alarm Data Model Concepts

   This section defines the fundamental concepts behind the data model.
   This section is rooted in the works of Vallin et. al [ALARMSEM].

3.1.  Alarm Definition

   An alarm signifies an undesirable state in a resource that requires
   corrective action.







Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   There are two main things to remember from this definition:

   1.  It focuses on leaving out events and logging information in
       general.  Alarms should only be used for undesired states that
       require action.

   2.  It also focuses on alarms as a state on a resource, not the
       notifications that report the state changes.

   See Appendix F for information on how this definition relates to
   other alarm standards.

3.2.  Alarm Type

   This document defines an alarm type with an alarm-type id and an
   alarm-type qualifier.

   The alarm-type id is modeled as a YANG identity.  With YANG
   identities, new alarm types can be defined in a distributed fashion.
   YANG identities are hierarchical, which means that a hierarchy of
   alarm types can be defined.

   Standards and vendors should define their own alarm-type identities
   based on this definition.

   The use of YANG identities means that all possible alarms are
   identified at design time.  This explicit declaration of alarm types
   makes it easier to allow for alarm qualification reviews and
   preparation of alarm actions and documentation.

   There are occasions where the alarm types are not known at design
   time.  An example is a system with digital inputs that allows users
   to connect detectors, such as smoke detectors, to the inputs.  In
   this case, it is a configuration action that says certain connectors
   are fire alarms, for example.

   In order to allow for dynamic addition of alarm types, the alarm data
   model permits further qualification of the identity-based alarm type
   using a string.  A potential drawback of this is that there is a
   significant risk that alarm operators will receive alarm types as a
   surprise.  They do not know how to resolve the problem since a
   defined alarm procedure does not necessarily exist.  To avoid this
   risk, the system MUST publish all possible alarm types in the alarm
   inventory; see Section 4.2.







Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   A vendor or standards organization can define their own alarm-type
   hierarchy.  The example below shows a hierarchy based on X.733 event
   types:

     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity vendor-alarms {
       base al:alarm-type;
     }
     identity communications-alarm {
       base vendor-alarms;
     }
     identity link-alarm {
       base communications-alarm;
     }

   Alarm types can be abstract.  An abstract alarm type is used as a
   base for defining hierarchical alarm types.  Concrete alarm types are
   used for alarm states and appear in the alarm inventory.  There are
   two kinds of concrete alarm types:

   1.  The last subordinate identity in the "alarm-type-id" hierarchy is
       concrete, for example, "alarm-identity.environmental-
       alarm.smoke".  In this example, "alarm-identity" and
       "environmental-alarm" are abstract YANG identities, whereas
       "smoke" is a concrete YANG identity.

   2.  The YANG identity hierarchy is abstract, and the concrete alarm
       type is defined by the dynamic alarm-qualifier string, for
       example, "alarm-identity.environmental-alarm.external-detector"
       with alarm-type-qualifier "smoke".



















Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   For example:

     // Alternative 1: concrete alarm type identity
     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity environmental-alarm {
       base al:alarm-type;
       description "Abstract alarm type";
     }
     identity smoke {
       base environmental-alarm;
       description "Concrete alarm type";
     }

     // Alternative 2: concrete alarm type qualifier
     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }
     identity environmental-alarm {
       base al:alarm-type;
       description "Abstract alarm type";
     }
     identity external-detector {
       base environmental-alarm;
       description
         "Abstract alarm type; a runtime configuration
          procedure sets the type of alarm detected.  This will
          be reported in the alarm-type-qualifier.";
     }

   A server SHOULD strive to minimize the number of dynamically defined
   alarm types.

3.3.  Identifying the Alarming Resource

   It is of vital importance to be able to refer to the alarming
   resource.  This reference must be as fine-grained as possible.  If
   the alarming resource exists in the data tree, an instance-identifier
   MUST be used with the full path to the object.

   When the module is used in a controller/orchestrator/manager, the
   original device resource identification can be modified to include
   the device in the path.  The details depend on how devices are
   identified and are out of scope for this specification.






Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                    [Page 8]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   Example:

      The original device alarm might identify the resource as
      "/dev:interfaces/dev:interface[dev:name='FastEthernet1/0']".

      The resource identification in the manager could look something
      like: "/mgr:devices/mgr:device[mgr:name='xyz123']/dev:interfaces/
      dev:interface[dev:name='FastEthernet1/0']"

   This module also allows for alternate naming of the alarming resource
   if it is not available in the data tree.

3.4.  Identifying Alarm Instances

   A primary goal of the alarm data model is to remove any ambiguity in
   how alarm notifications are mapped to an update of an alarm instance.
   The X.733 [X.733] and 3GPP [ALARMIRP] documents were not clear on
   this point.  This alarm data model states that the tuple (resource,
   alarm-type identifier, and alarm-type qualifier) corresponds to a
   single alarm instance.  This means that alarm notifications for the
   same resource and same alarm type are matched to update the same
   alarm instance.  These three leafs are therefore used as the key in
   the alarm list:

     list alarm {
       key "resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier";
       ...
     }

3.5.  Alarm Lifecycle

   The alarm model clearly separates the resource alarm lifecycle from
   the operator and administrative lifecycles of an alarm.

   o  resource alarm lifecycle: the alarm instrumentation that controls
      alarm raise, clearance, and severity changes.

   o  operator alarm lifecycle: operators acting upon alarms with
      actions like acknowledging and closing.  Closing an alarm implies
      that the operator considers the corrective action performed.
      Operators can also shelve (block/filter) alarms in order to avoid
      nuisance alarms.

   o  administrative alarm lifecycle: purging (deleting) unwanted alarms
      and compressing the alarm status-change list.  This module exposes
      operations to manage the administrative lifecycle.  The server may
      also perform these operations based on other policies, but how
      that is done is out of scope for this document.



Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                    [Page 9]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   A server SHOULD describe how long it retains cleared/closed alarms
   until they are manually purged or if it has an automatic removal
   policy.  How this is done is outside the scope of this document.

3.5.1.  Resource Alarm Lifecycle

   From a resource perspective, an alarm can, for example, have the
   following lifecycle: raise, change severity, change severity, clear,
   being raised again, etc.  All of these status changes can have
   different alarm texts generated by the instrumentation.  Two
   important things to note:

   1.  Alarms are not deleted when they are cleared.  Deleting alarms is
       an administrative process.  The "ietf-alarms" YANG module defines
       an action "purge-alarms" that deletes alarms.

   2.  Alarms are not cleared by operators; only the underlying
       instrumentation can clear an alarm.  Operators can close alarms.

   The YANG tree representation below illustrates the resource-oriented
   lifecycle:

     +--ro alarm* [resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier]
        ...
        +--ro is-cleared                 boolean
        +--ro last-raised                yang:date-and-time
        +--ro last-changed               yang:date-and-time
        +--ro perceived-severity         severity
        +--ro alarm-text                 alarm-text
        +--ro status-change* [time] {alarm-history}?
           +--ro time                    yang:date-and-time
           +--ro perceived-severity      severity-with-clear
           +--ro alarm-text              alarm-text

   For every status change from the resource perspective, a row is added
   to the "status-change" list, if the server implements the feature
   "alarm-history".  The feature "alarm-history" is optional to
   implement, since keeping the alarm history may have an impact on the
   server's memory resources.

   The last status values are also represented as leafs for the alarm.
   Note well that the alarm severity does not include "cleared"; alarm
   clearance is a boolean flag.

   Therefore, an alarm can look like this: (("GigabitEthernet0/25",
   "link-alarm",""), false, 2018-04-08T08:20:10.00Z,
   2018-04-08T08:20:10.00Z, major, "Interface GigabitEthernet0/25
   down").

3.5.2.  Operator Alarm Lifecycle

   Operators can act upon alarms using the set-operator-state action:

     +--ro alarm* [resource alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier]
        ...
        +--ro operator-state-change* [time] {operator-actions}?
        |  +--ro time        yang:date-and-time
        |  +--ro operator    string
        |  +--ro state       operator-state
        |  +--ro text?       string
        +---x set-operator-state {operator-actions}?
           +---w input
              +---w state    writable-operator-state
              +---w text?    string

   The operator state for an alarm can be "none", "ack", "shelved", and
   "closed".  Alarm deletion (using the action "purge-alarms") can use
   this state as a criterion.  For example, a closed alarm is an alarm
   where the operator has performed any required corrective actions.
   Closed alarms are good candidates for being purged.

3.5.3.  Administrative Alarm Lifecycle

   Deleting alarms from the alarm list is considered an administrative
   action.  This is supported by the "purge-alarms" action.  The "purge-
   alarms" action takes a filter as input.  The filter selects alarms
   based on the operator and resource alarm lifecycle such as "all
   closed cleared alarms older than a time specification".  The server
   may also perform these operations based on other policies, but how
   that is done is out of scope for this document.

   Purged alarms are removed from the alarm list.  Note well that if the
   alarm resource state changes after a purge, the alarm will reappear
   in the alarm list.

   Alarms can be compressed.  Compressing an alarm deletes all entries
   in the alarm's "status-change" list except for the last status
   change.  A client can perform this using the "compress-alarms"
   action.  The server may also perform these operations based on other
   policies, but how that is done is out of scope for this document.

3.6.  Root Cause, Impacted Resources, and Related Alarms

   The alarm data model does not mandate any requirements for the system
   to support alarm correlation or root-cause and service-impact
   analysis.  However, if such features are supported, this section
   describes how the results of such analysis are represented in the



Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                   [Page 11]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   data model.  These parts of the model are optional.  The module
   supports three scenarios:

   Root-cause analysis:  An alarm can indicate candidate root-cause
      resources, for example, a database issue alarm referring to a
      full-disk partition.

   Service-impact analysis:  An alarm can refer to potential impacted
      resources, for example, an interface alarm referring to impacted
      network services.

   Alarm correlation:  Dependencies between alarms; several alarms can
      be grouped as relating to each other, for example, a streaming
      media alarm relating to a high-jitter alarm.

   Different systems have varying degrees of alarm correlation and
   analysis capabilities, and the intent of the alarm data model is to
   enable any capability, including none.

   The general principle of this alarm data model is to limit the amount
   of alarms.  In many cases, several resources are affected for a given
   underlying problem.  A full disk will of course impact databases and
   applications as well.  The recommendation is to have a single alarm
   for the underlying problem and list the affected resources in the
   alarm rather than having separate alarms for each resource.

   The alarm has one leaf-list to identify a possible "impacted-
   resource" and a leaf-list to identify a possible "root-cause-
   resource".  These serve as hints only.  It is up to the client
   application to use this information to present the overall status.
   Using the disk-full example, a good alarm would be to use the hard-
   disk partition as the alarming resource and add the database and
   applications into the "impacted-resource" leaf-list.

   A system should always strive to identify the resource that can be
   acted upon as the "resource" leaf.  The "impacted-resource" leaf-list
   shall be used to identify any side effects of the alarm.  The
   impacted resources cannot be acted upon to fix the problem.  The disk
   full example above illustrates the principle; you cannot fix the
   underlying issue by database operations.  However, you need to pay
   attention to the database to perform any operations that limit the
   impact of the problem.

   On some occasions, the system might not be capable of detecting the
   root cause, the resource that can be acted upon.  The instrumentation
   in this case only monitors the side effect and raises an alarm to
   indicate a situation requiring attention.  The instrumentation still
   might identify possible candidates for the root-cause resource.  In



Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                   [Page 12]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   this case, the "root-cause-resource" leaf-list can be used to
   indicate the candidate root-cause resources.  An example of this kind
   of alarm might be an active test tool that detects a Service Level
   Agreement (SLA) violation on a VPN connection and identifies the
   devices along the chain as candidate root causes.

   The alarm data model also supports a way to associate different
   alarms with each other using the "related-alarm" list.  This list
   enables the server to inform the client that certain alarms are
   related to other alarms.

   Note well that this module does not prescribe any dependencies or
   preference between the above alarm correlation mechanisms.  Different
   systems have different capabilities, and the above described
   mechanisms are available to support the instrumentation features.

3.7.  Alarm Shelving

   Alarm shelving is an important function in order for alarm-management
   applications and operators to stop superfluous alarms.  A shelved
   alarm implies that any alarms fulfilling these criteria are ignored
   (blocked/filtered).  Shelved alarms appear in a dedicated shelved-
   alarm list; thus, they can be filtered out so that the main alarm
   list only contains entries of interest.  Shelved alarms do not
   generate notifications, but the shelved-alarm list is updated with
   any alarm-state changes.

   Alarm shelving is optional to implement, since matching alarms
   against shelf criteria may have an impact on the server's processing
   resources.

3.8.  Alarm Profiles

   Alarm profiles are used to configure further information to an alarm
   type.  This module supports configuring severity levels overriding
   the system-default levels.  This corresponds to the Alarm Severity
   Assignment Profile (ASAP) functionality in M.3100 [M.3100] and M.3160
   [M.3160].  Other standard or enterprise modules can augment this list
   with further alarm-type information.

4.  Alarm Data Model

   The fundamental parts of the data model are the "alarm-list" with
   associated notifications and the "alarm-inventory" list of all
   possible alarm types.  These MUST be implemented by a system.  The
   rest of the data model is made conditional with these YANG features:
   "operator-actions", "alarm-shelving", "alarm-history", "alarm-
   summary", "alarm-profile", and "severity-assignment".

   The data model has the following overall structure:

4.1.  Alarm Control

   The "/alarms/control/notify-status-changes" leaf controls whether
   notifications are sent for all state changes, only raise and clear,
   or only notifications more severe than a configured level.  This
   feature, in combination with alarm shelving, corresponds to the ITU
   Alarm Report Control functionality; see Appendix F.2.4.

   Every alarm has a list of status changes.  The length of this list is
   controlled by "/alarms/control/max-alarm-status-changes".  When the
   list is full and a new entry created, the oldest entry is removed.

4.1.1.  Alarm Shelving

   The shelving control tree is shown below:

     +--rw control
        +--rw alarm-shelving {alarm-shelving}?
           +--rw shelf* [name]
              +--rw name           string
              +--rw resource*      resource-match
              +--rw alarm-type*
              |       [alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier-match]
              |  +--rw alarm-type-id                 alarm-type-id
              |  +--rw alarm-type-qualifier-match    string
              +--rw description?   string


   Shelved alarms are shown in a dedicated shelved-alarm list.  Matching
   alarms MUST appear in the "/alarms/shelved-alarms/shelved-alarm"
   list, and non-matching alarms MUST appear in the "/alarms/alarm-list/
   alarm" list.  The server does not send any notifications for shelved
   alarms.

   Shelving and unshelving can only be performed by editing the shelf
   configuration.  It cannot be performed on individual alarms.  The
   server will add an operator state indicating that the alarm was
   shelved/unshelved.

   A leaf, "/alarms/summary/shelves-active", in the alarm summary
   indicates if there are shelved alarms.

   A system can select not to support the shelving feature.

4.2.  Alarm Inventory

   The alarm inventory represents all possible alarm types that may
   occur in the system.  A management system may use this to build alarm
   procedures.  The alarm inventory is relevant for the following
   reasons:

      The system might not implement all defined alarm type identities,
      and some alarm identities are abstract.

      The system has configured dynamic alarm types using the alarm
      qualifier.  The inventory makes it possible for the management
      system to discover these.

   Note that the mechanism whereby dynamic alarm types are added using
   the alarm-type qualifier MUST populate this list.

   The optional leaf-list "resource" in the alarm inventory enables the
   system to publish for which resources a given alarm type may appear.

   A server MUST implement the alarm inventory in order to enable
   controlled alarm procedures in the client.

   A server implementer may want to document the alarm inventory for
   offline processing by clients.  The file format defined in
   [YANG-INSTANCE] can be used for this purpose.

   The alarm inventory tree is shown below:

     +--ro alarm-inventory
        +--ro alarm-type* [alarm-type-id alarm-type-qualifier]
           +--ro alarm-type-id           alarm-type-id
           +--ro alarm-type-qualifier    alarm-type-qualifier
           +--ro resource*               resource-match
           +--ro will-clear              boolean
           +--ro severity-level*         severity
           +--ro description             string


4.3.  Alarm Summary

   The alarm summary list summarizes alarms per severity: how many
   cleared, cleared and closed, and closed.  It also gives an indication
   if there are shelved alarms.

   The alarm summary tree is shown below:

     +--ro summary {alarm-summary}?
        +--ro alarm-summary* [severity]
        |  +--ro severity                  severity

        +--ro shelves-active?   empty {alarm-shelving}?

4.4.  The Alarm List

   The alarm list, "/alarms/alarm-list", is a function from the tuple
   (resource, alarm type, alarm-type qualifier) to the current composite
   alarm state.  The composite state includes states for the resource
   alarm lifecycle such as severity, clearance flag, and operator states
   such as acknowledged.  This means that for a given resource and alarm
   type, the alarm list shows the current states of the alarm such as
   acknowledged and cleared.

   Every alarm has three important states: the resource clearance state
   "is-cleared", the severity "perceived-severity", and the operator
   state available in the operator-state change list.

   In order to see the alarm history, the resource state changes are
   available in the "status-change" list, and the operator history is
   available in the "operator-state-change" list.

4.5.  The Shelved-Alarm List

   The shelved-alarm list has the same structure as the alarm list
   above.  It shows all the alarms that match the shelving criteria
   "/alarms/control/alarm-shelving".

4.6.  Alarm Profiles

   Alarm profiles, "/alarms/alarm-profile", is a list of configurable
   alarm types.  The list supports configurable alarm severity levels in
   the container "alarm-severity-assignment-profile".  If an alarm
   matches the configured alarm type, it MUST use the configured
   severity level(s) instead of the system default.  This configuration
   MUST also be represented in the alarm inventory.

4.7.  Operations

   The alarm data model supports the following actions to manage the
   alarms:

   "/alarms/alarm-list/purge-alarms":  Delete alarms from the "alarm-
      list" according to specific criteria, for example, all cleared
      alarms older than a specific date.

   "/alarms/alarm-list/compress-alarms":  Compress the "status-change"
      list for the alarms.

   "/alarms/alarm-list/alarm/set-operator-state":  Change the operator
      state for an alarm.  For example, an alarm can be acknowledged by
      setting the operator state to "ack".

   "/alarms/shelved-alarm-list/purge-shelved-alarms":  Delete alarms
      from the "shelved-alarm-list" according to specific criteria, for
      example, all alarms older than a specific date.

   "/alarms/shelved-alarm-list/compress-shelved-alarms":  Compress the
      "status-change" list for the alarms.

4.8.  Notifications

   The alarm data model supports a general notification to report alarm-
   state changes.  It carries all relevant parameters for the alarm-
   management application.

   There is also a notification to report that an operator changed the
   operator state on an alarm, like acknowledged.

   If the alarm inventory is changed, for example, a new card type is
   inserted, a notification will tell the management application that
   new alarm types are available.

5.  Relationship to the ietf-hardware YANG Module

   RFC 8348 [RFC8348] defines the "ietf-hardware" YANG data model for
   the management of hardware.  The "alarm-state" in RFC 8348 is a
   summary of the alarm severity levels that may be active on the
   specific hardware component.  It does not say anything about how
   alarms are reported, and it doesn't provide any details of the
   alarms.

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   The mapping between the alarm YANG data model, prefix "al", and the
   "alarm-state" in RFC 8348, prefix "hw", is as follows:

   "al:resource":  Corresponds to an entry in the list
      "/hw:hardware/hw:component/".

   "al:is-cleared":  No bit set in "/hw:hardware/hw:component/hw:state/

       Main features of this module include:

         * Alarm list:
                   A list of all alarms.  Cleared alarms stay in
                   the list until explicitly purged.

         * Operator actions on alarms:
                   Acknowledging and closing alarms.

         * Administrative actions on alarms:
                   Purging alarms from the list according to specific
                   criteria.

         * Alarm inventory:
                   A management application can read all
                   alarm types implemented by the system.

         * Alarm shelving:
                   Shelving (blocking) alarms according
                   to specific criteria.

         * Alarm profiles:
                   A management system can attach further
                   information to alarm types, for example,
                   overriding system-default severity
                   levels.

       This module uses a stateful view on alarms.  An alarm is a state
       for a specific resource (note that an alarm is not a
       notification).  An alarm type is a possible alarm state for a
       resource.  For example, the tuple:

         ('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25')

       is an alarm of type 'link-alarm' on the resource
       'GigabitEthernet0/25'.

       Alarm types are identified using YANG identities and an optional
       string-based qualifier.  The string-based qualifier allows for
       dynamic extension of the statically defined alarm types.  Alarm
       types identify a possible alarm state and not the individual
       notifications.  For example, the traditional 'link-down' and
       'link-up' notifications are two notifications referring to the
       same alarm type 'link-alarm'.

       With this design, there is no ambiguity about how alarm and
       alarm clear correlation should be performed; notifications that
       report the same resource and alarm type are considered updates



Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                   [Page 22]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


       of the same alarm, e.g., clearing an active alarm or changing
       the severity of an alarm.  The instrumentation can update the
       severity and alarm text on an existing alarm.  The above alarm
       example can therefore look like the following:

         (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
          warning,
          'interface down while interface admin state is up')

       There is a clear separation between updates on the alarm from
       the underlying resource, like clear, and updates from an
       operator, like acknowledging or closing an alarm:

         (('link-alarm', 'GigabitEthernet0/25'),
          warning,
          'interface down while interface admin state is up',
          cleared,
          closed)

       Administrative actions like removing closed alarms older than a
       given time is supported.

       This YANG module does not define how the underlying
       instrumentation detects and clears the specific alarms.  That
       belongs to the Standards Development Organization (SDO) or
       enterprise that owns that specific technology.

       The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
       NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',
       'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as
       described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
       they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

        "This type is used to match resources of type 'resource'.
         Since the type 'resource' is a union of different types, the
         'resource-match' type is also a union of corresponding types.

         If the type is given as an XPath 1.0 expression, a resource
         of type 'instance-identifier' matches if the instance is part
         of the node set that is the result of evaluating the XPath 1.0
         expression.  For example, the XPath 1.0 expression:

          /ietf-interfaces:interfaces/ietf-interfaces:interface

         assuming that the interface 'eth1' is of type
         'ianaift:ethernetCsmacd'.

         If the type is given as an object identifier, a resource of
         type 'object-identifier' matches if the match object
         identifier is a prefix of the resource's object identifier.
         For example, the value:

          1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2

         as an XML Schema regular expression, which matches a resource
         of type 'yang:uuid' or 'string' if the given regular
         expression matches the resource string.

         If the type is given as an XPath expression, it is evaluated

7.  The X.733 Mapping Module

   Many alarm systems are based on the X.733 [X.733] and X.736 [X.736]
   alarm standards.  This module "ietf-alarms-x733" augments the alarm
   inventory, the alarm lists, and the alarm notification with X.733 and
   X.736 parameters.

   The module also supports a feature whereby the alarm manager can
   configure the mapping from alarm types to X.733 "event-type" and
   "probable-cause" parameters.  This might be needed when the default
   mapping provided by the system is in conflict with other management
   systems or not considered correct.

   Note that the term "resource" in this document is synonymous to the
   ITU term "managed object".

   This YANG module references [RFC6991], [X.721], [X.733], and [X.736].

     description
       "This module augments the ietf-alarms module with X.733 alarm
        parameters.

        The following structures are augmented with the X.733 event type
        and probable cause:

         1) alarms/alarm-inventory: all possible alarm types
         2) alarms/alarm-list: every alarm in the system
         3) alarm-notification: notifications indicating alarm-state
            changes
         4) alarms/shelved-alarms

        The module also optionally allows the alarm-management system
        to configure the mapping from the ietf-alarms' alarm keys
        to the ITU tuple (event-type, probable-cause).

        The mapping does not include a corresponding problem value
        specific to X.733.  The recommendation is to use the
        'alarm-type-qualifier' leaf, which serves the same purpose.

        The module uses an integer and a corresponding string for
        probable cause instead of a globally defined enumeration, in
        order to be able to manage conflicting enumeration definitions.
        A single globally defined enumeration is challenging to
        maintain.

        The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
        NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',
        'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
        they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

   This document registers two URIs in the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688].  Following the format in RFC 3688, the following
   registrations have been made.

       URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-alarms

       Registrant Contact: The IESG.
       XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers two YANG modules in the "YANG Module Names"

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The list of alarms itself may be potentially sensitive from a
   security perspective, in that it potentially gives an attacker an
   authoritative picture of the (broken) state of the network.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   in the "ietf-alarms" module and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/alarms/control/notify-status-changes":  This leaf controls whether
      an alarm should notify based on various state changes.
      Unauthorized access to this leaf could have a negative impact on
      operational procedures relying on fine-grained alarm-state change
      reporting.

   "/alarms/control/alarm-shelving/shelf":  This list controls the
      shelving (blocking) of alarms.  Unauthorized access to this list
      could jeopardize the alarm-management procedures, since these
      alarms will not be notified or be part of the alarm list.

   "/alarms/control/alarm-profile/alarm-severity-assignment-profile":
      This list controls the severity levels of an alarm.  Unauthorized
      access to this could, for example, downgrade the severity of an
      alarm and thereby have a negative impact on the alarm-monitoring
      process.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/alarms/alarm-list/purge-alarms":  This action deletes alarms from
      the alarm list.  Unauthorized use of this action could jeopardize
      the alarm-management procedures since the deleted alarms may be
      vital for the alarm-management application.

   "/alarms/alarm-list/alarm/set-operator-state":  This action can be
      used by the operator to indicate the level of human intervention
      on an alarm.  Unauthorized use of this action could result in
      alarms being ignored by operators.

Appendix A.  Vendor-Specific Alarm Types Example

   This example shows how to define alarm types in a vendor-specific
   module.  In this case, the vendor "xyz" has chosen to define top-
   level identities according to X.733 event types.

   module example-xyz-alarms {
     namespace "urn:example:xyz-alarms";
     prefix xyz-al;

     import ietf-alarms {
       prefix al;
     }

     identity xyz-alarms {
       base al:alarm-type-id;
     }

     identity communications-alarm {
       base xyz-alarms;
     }
     identity quality-of-service-alarm {
       base xyz-alarms;

Appendix B.  Alarm Inventory Example

   This shows an alarm inventory: one alarm type is defined only with
   the identifier and another is dynamically configured.  In the latter
   case, a digital input has been connected to a smoke detector;
   therefore, the "alarm-type-qualifier" is set to "smoke-detector" and
   the "alarm-type-id" to "environmental-alarm".

   <alarms xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-alarms"
           xmlns:xyz-al="urn:example:xyz-alarms"
           xmlns:dev="urn:example:device">

Appendix D.  Alarm Shelving Example

   This example shows how to shelve alarms.  We shelve alarms related to
   the smoke detectors, since they are being installed and tested.  We
   also shelve all alarms from FastEthernet1/0.

Appendix E.  X.733 Mapping Example

   This example shows how to map a dynamic alarm type (alarm-type-
   id=environmental-alarm, alarm-type-qualifier=smoke-alarm) to the
   corresponding X.733 "event-type" and "probable-cause" parameters.

   <alarms xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-alarms"

   +------------+---------------------------+--------------------------+

           Table 1: Definition of the Term "Alarm" in Standards

   The evolution of the definition of alarm moves from focused on events
   reporting a deviation from normal operation towards a definition to a
   undesired *state* that *requires an operator action*.

F.2.  Data Model

   This section describes how this YANG alarm data model relates to
   other standard data models.  Note well that we cover other data
   models for alarm interfaces but not other standards such as SDO-
   specific alarms.

F.2.1.  X.733

   X.733 has acted as a base for several alarm data models over the
   years.  The YANG alarm data model differs in the following ways:

      X.733 models the alarm list as a list of notifications.  The YANG
      alarm data model defines the alarm list as the current alarm
      states for the resources, which is generated from the state change
      reporting notifications.




Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                   [Page 76]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


      In X.733, an alarm can have the severity level "clear".  In the
      YANG alarm data model, "clear" is not a severity level; it is a
      separate state of the alarm.  An alarm can have the following
      states, for example, (major, cleared) and (minor, not cleared).

      X.733 uses a flat, globally defined enumerated "probable-cause" to
      identify alarm types.  This alarm data model uses a hierarchical
      YANG identity: "alarm-type".  This enables delegation of alarm
      types within organizations.  It also enables management to reason
      about abstract alarm types corresponding to base identities; see
      Section 3.2.

      The YANG alarm data model has not included the majority of the
      X.733 alarm attributes.  Rather, these are defined in an
      augmenting module [X.733] if "strict" X.733 compliance is needed.

F.2.2.  The Alarm MIB (RFC 3877)

   The MIB in RFC 3877 takes a different approach; rather than defining
   a concrete data model for alarms, it defines a model to map existing
   SNMP-managed objects and notifications into alarm states and alarm
   notifications.  This was necessary since MIBs were already defined
   with both managed objects and notifications indicating alarms, for
   example, "linkUp" and "linkDown" notifications in combination with
   "ifAdminState" and "ifOperState".  So, RFC 3877 cannot really be
   compared to the alarm YANG module in that sense.

   The Alarm MIB maps existing MIB definitions into alarms, such as
   "alarmModelTable".  The upside of that is that an SNMP Manager can,
   at runtime, read the possible alarm types.  This corresponds to the
   "alarmInventory" in the alarm YANG module.

F.2.3.  3GPP Alarm IRP

   The 3GPP Alarm IRP is an evolution of X.733.  Main differences
   between the alarm YANG module and 3GPP are as follows:

      3GPP keeps the majority of the X.733 attributes, but the alarm
      YANG module does not.

      3GPP introduced overlapping and possibly conflicting keys for
      alarms, alarmId, and (managed object, event type, probable cause,
      specific problem).  (See Example 3 in Annex C of [ALARMIRP]).  In
      the YANG alarm data model, the key for identifying an alarm
      instance is clearly defined by ("resource", "alarm-type-id",
      "alarm-type-qualifier").  See also Section 3.4 for more
      information.




Vallin & Bjorklund           Standards Track                   [Page 77]

RFC 8632         A YANG Data Model for Alarm Management   September 2019


      The alarm YANG module clearly separates the resource/
      instrumentation lifecycle from the operator lifecycle. 3GPP allows
      operators to set the alarm severity to clear; this is not allowed
      by this module.  Rather, an operator closes an alarm, which does
      not affect the severity.

F.2.4.  G.7710

   G.7710 is different than the previously referenced alarm standards.
   It does not define a data model for alarm reporting.  It defines
   common equipment management function requirements including alarm
   instrumentation.  The scope is transport networks.

   The requirements in G.7710 correspond to features in the alarm YANG
   module in the following way:

      Alarm Severity Assignment Profile (ASAP): the alarm profile
      "/alarms/alarm-profile/".

      Alarm Reporting Control (ARC): alarm shelving "/alarms/control/
      alarm-shelving/" and the ability to control alarm notifications
      "/alarms/control/notify-status-changes".  Alarm shelving
      corresponds to the use case of turning off alarm reporting for a
      specific resource, which is the NALM (No ALarM) state in M.3100.

Appendix G.  Alarm-Usability Requirements

   This section defines usability requirements for alarms.  Alarm
   usability is important for an alarm interface.  A data model will
   help in defining the format, but if the actual alarms are of low
   value, we have not gained the goal of alarm management.

   Common alarm problems and their causes are summarized in Table 2.
   This summary is adopted to networking based on the ISA [ISA182] and
   Engineering Equipment Materials Users Association (EEMUA) [EEMUA]
   standards.

   |                            | require a complex operator response. |
   +----------------------------+--------------------------------------+

                 Table 5: Acceptable Alarm Rates -- Burst

   The numbers in Tables 4 and 5 are the sum of all alarms for a network
   being managed from one alarm console.  So every individual system or
   Network Management System (NMS) contributes to these numbers.

   Vendors SHOULD make sure that the following rules are used in
   designing the alarm interface:

   1.  Rationalize the alarms in the system to ensure that every alarm
       is necessary, has a purpose, and follows the cardinal rule that
       it requires an operator response.  Adheres to the rules of
       Table 3.

   2.  Audit the quality of the alarms.  Talk with the operators about
       how well the alarm information supports them.  Do they know what
       to do in the event of an alarm?  Are they able to quickly
       diagnose the problem and determine the corrective action?  Does
       the alarm text adhere to the requirements in Table 3?

   3.  Analyze and benchmark the performance of the system and compare
       it to the recommended metrics in Tables 4 and 5.  Start by
       identifying nuisance alarms, as well as standing alarms at normal
       state and startup.
