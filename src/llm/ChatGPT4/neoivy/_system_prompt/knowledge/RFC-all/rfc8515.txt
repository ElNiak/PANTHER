                    URN Namespace for ETSI Documents

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) "etsi" for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
   (http://etsi.org).  ETSI specifies and manages resources that utilize
   this URN identification model.  Management activities for these and
   other resource types are handled by the manager of the ETSI Protocol
   Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS).

RFC 8515                   Namespace for ETSI              February 2019


1.  Introduction

   ETSI is a nonprofit international industry standards organization
   that produces globally acceptable standards for information and
   communication technologies including fixed, mobile, radio, broadcast,
   internet, aeronautical, and other areas.

   As part of these efforts, there is a need to specify identifiers in a
   managed namespace that are unique and persistent.  To ensure that
   this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a
   specific Uniform Resource Name (URN) [RFC8141] Namespace Identifier
   (NID) for use by ETSI is specified in this document, in full
   conformance with the NID registration process specified in [RFC8141].

2.  URN Specification for ETSI

   Namespace Identifier:

      etsi

   Version:

      1

   Date:

      2018-10-22

   Registrant:

      ETSI Protocol Naming and Numbering Service (PNNS)
      European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
      650, Route des Lucioles
      Sophia Antipolis 06560
      France
      Email: pnns@etsi.org

   Purpose:

      The Namespace Identifier (NID) "etsi" for Uniform Resource Names
      (URNs) will be used to identify resources published by ETSI.
      These might include published standards or protocols that ETSI
      defines and that make use of URNs.  These namespaces are globally
      unique.  The URN namespace will be used in public networks by
      clients to configure and manage resources in the network.  Servers
      will enforce the uniqueness of the namespaces by using the
      namespace and the XPath associated with the managed node in the
      network when accessing a resource.

   Syntax:

      The syntax of Namespace Specific Strings for the "etsi" namespace
      is <NSS> in Uniform Resource Names (URNs) [RFC8141].

      The entire URN is case-insensitive.

   Assignment:

      ETSI will maintain the list of registered subtrees that use the
      "etsi" NID in the "ETSI URN Namespace" registry at
      <https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/
      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx>.  The registry describes the <NSS>, how
      namespaces will be allocated, and how experimental namespaces can
      be used within the allocated URN.

      ETSI will manage resource classes using the "etsi" NID and will be
      the authority for managing resources and associated subsequent
      strings.  ETSI will guarantee the uniqueness of the strings by
      validating them against the existing content of the registry.
      ETSI may also permit secondary responsibility for certain defined
      resources.  Once a subtree assignment is made, it cannot be
      deleted or reassigned.

      ETSI may allow use of experimental type values in specific
      subtrees for testing purposes only.  Note that using experimental
      types may create collision as multiple users may use the same
      values for different resources and specific strings.  All
      experimentation must follow the guidance set forth in "A Uniform
      Resource Name (URN) Namespace for Examples" [RFC6963].

   Security and Privacy:

      See Section 4 of RFC 8515.

   Interoperability:

      There are no known interoperability issues at this time.

   Resolution:

      It is not foreseen that URNs within this namespace will undergo
      resolution.

   Documentation:

      Documentation can be found at
      <https://portal.etsi.org/PNNS/GenericAllocation/
      ETSIURNNamespace.aspx>.

3.  Examples

   The following are examples of URNs that ETSI is looking to assign:

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv-vnf

      urn:etsi:yang:etsi-nfv-pnf

   Although all of these examples are related to network management with
   YANG [RFC7950], URNs related to other kinds of resources might be
   assigned in the future, in which case a "sub-identifier" other than
   "yang" might be created.

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations apart from what are
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in "Functional Requirements for Uniform Resource
   Names" [RFC1737] and "Uniform Resource Names (URNs)" [RFC8141].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered "etsi" in the "Formal URN Namespaces" registry
   using the template in Section 2.
