 Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Router Implementation Report

Abstract

   This document is an implementation report for the Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) Router protocol as defined in RFC 6810.  The
   authors did not verify the accuracy of the information provided by
   respondents.  The respondents are experts with the implementations
   they reported on, and their responses are considered authoritative
   for the implementations for which their responses represent.  The
   respondents were asked to only use the "YES" answer if the feature
   had at least been tested in the lab.

RFC 7128            RPKI Router Implementation Report      February 2014


1.  Introduction

   In order to formally validate the origin Autonomous Systems (ASes) of
   BGP announcements, routers need a simple but reliable mechanism to
   receive Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6810] prefix
   origin data from a trusted cache.  The RPKI Router protocol defined
   in [RFC6810] provides a mechanism to deliver validated prefix origin
   data to routers.

   This document provides an implementation report for the RPKI Router
   protocol as defined in RFC 6810 [RFC6810].

   The authors did not verify the accuracy of the information provided
   by respondents or by any alternative means.  The respondents are
   experts with the implementations they reported on, and their
   responses are considered authoritative for the implementations for
   which their responses represent.  Respondents were asked to only use
   the "YES" answer if the feature had at least been tested in the lab.

4.  Protocol Sequence

   Does the RPKI Router protocol implementation follow the four protocol
   sequences as outlined in Section 6 of [RFC6810]?

   S1:  Start or Restart

   S2:  Typical Exchange

   S3:  No Incremental Update Available

   S4:  Cache Has No Data Available

   +----+-----+-----+-------+--------+---------+------+--------+-------+
   |    | IOS |  XR | JUNOS |  rpki  |   rpki  | NCC  | RTRlib |  BBN  |
   |    |     |     |       |  .net  |   .net  |      |        |       |
   |    |     |     |       |  clnt  |   srvr  |      |        |       |
   +----+-----+-----+-------+--------+---------+------+--------+-------+
   | S1 | YES | YES |  YES  |  YES   |   YES   | YES  |  YES   |  YES  |
   | S2 | YES | YES |  YES  |  YES   |   YES   | NO~1 |  YES   |  YES  |
   | S3 | YES | YES |  YES  |  YES   |   YES   | YES  |  YES   |  YES  |
   | S4 | YES | YES |  YES  |  YES   |   YES   | YES  |  YES   | YES~2 |
   +----+-----+-----+-------+--------+---------+------+--------+-------+

   Note 1:  Does not implement Serial Query, thus Incremental Update is
            never available, so responds to Serial Query with Cache
            Reset as described in Section 6.3 of [RFC6810]

   Note 2:  Sends Cache Reset in response to Serial Query when no data;
            sends Error Report PDU in response to Reset Query when no
            data.

            not conclude it's inconsistent.

10.  Interoperable Implementations

   List other implementations with which you have tested the
   interoperability of the RPKI Router implementation.

10.1.  Cisco Implementation

   Cisco: The Cisco IOS and IOS-XR implementation should be
   interoperable with other vendor RPKI Router Protocol implementations.
   In particular, we have tested our interoperability with rpki.net's
   RPKI Router implementation.

10.2.  Juniper Implementation

   Juniper: The Juniper Networks, Inc. JUNOS implementation should be
   interoperable with other vendor RPKI Router Protocol implementations.
   In particular, we have tested our interoperability with rpki.net's
   and NCC's RPKI Router Cache implementation.

10.3.  rpki.net Implementation

   rpki.net: The rpki.net implementation should operate with other rpki-
   rtr implementations.  In particular, we have tested our rpki-rtr
   server's interoperability with Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS-XR, and Juniper.

10.4.  RIPE NCC Implementation

   RIPE NCC: The RIPE NCC validator has been tested by us with other
   rpki-rtr implementations.  In particular, we have tested with RTRlib
   and CISCO IOS.  We received positive feedback from close contacts who
   tested our validator with JUNOS and Quagga.

10.5.  RTRlib Implementation

   RTRlib: The RTRlib has been tested by us with other rpki-rtr
   implementations.  In particular, we have tested with rtr-origin from
   rpki.net and RIPE NCC Validator.

10.6.  BBN RPSTIR Implementation

   BBN RPSTIR: We have not yet tested with any other implementations.

11.  Security Considerations

   No new security issues are introduced to the RPKI Router protocol
   defined in [RFC6810].
