 IETF Administrative Support Activity 2.0: Consolidated Updates to IETF
                       Administrative Terminology

Abstract

   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative
   structure and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA)
   to a new "IASA 2.0" structure.  In addition to more substantive
   changes that are described in other documents, the transition to the
   2018 IETF Administrative Support structure changes several position
   titles and organizational relationships that are referenced
   elsewhere.  Rather than reissue those referencing documents
   individually, this specification provides updates to them and
   deprecates some now-obsolete documents to ensure that there is no
   confusion due to these changes.

1.  Introduction

   In 2018, the IETF began the transition to a new administrative
   structure, and updated its IETF Administrative Support Activity
   (IASA) to a new "IASA 2.0" structure [RFC8711].  Key IASA 2.0 changes
   have been specified in a series of documents, including changes to
   the IETF Trust [RFC8714], the rationale for it [RFC8715], a new
   defining document for the IETF Administration LLC [LLC-Agreement]
   (informally called the "IETF LLC" or just "the LLC" in places in this
   document and elsewhere), and adjustments to the procedures for
   nominations and selections for relevant positions [RFC8713].

   In addition to more substantive changes that are described in those
   and other documents, the IASA 2.0 structure changes several position
   titles and organizational relationships that are referenced in other
   documents.  Rather than reissue those documents individually, this
   document provides a unified update to them.

   This document updates RFCs 2028, 2418, 3005, 3710, 3929, 4633, and
   6702 (citations in context below) to make those terminology and
   related changes.  In addition, with the authorization of the IAB, it
   requests that the Informational RFC 3716 be made Historic (see
   Section 4).  The sections that follow identify the details of the
   relevant documents and the required changes.

2.  Where Appropriate, Replacement of the IETF Executive Director
    Position with the Managing Director, IETF Secretariat

   Under the IASA 2.0 structure, most of the responsibilities of the
   former position of IETF Executive Director have been assigned to a
   new position (or at least title) of Managing Director, IETF
   Secretariat.  An "Executive Director" title is now associated with
   different, and largely new, responsibilities as an officer of the
   IETF Administration LLC.  These changes are covered in the
   description of the new structural arrangements [RFC8711].

   This document applies that change to the following:

   *  RFC 2028, "The Organizations Involved in the IETF Standards
      Process", [RFC2028], Section 3.3.

   *  RFC 2418, "IETF Working Group Guidelines and Procedures",
      [RFC2418], Section 1.

   *  RFC 3710, "An IESG Charter", [RFC3710], Section 2.

   *  RFC 3929, "Alternative Decision Making Processes for Consensus-
      Blocked Decisions in the IETF", [RFC3929], Sections 4.1.1 and 4.3
      (twice).

   *  RFC 4633, "Experiment in Long-Term Suspensions From Internet
      Engineering Task Force (IETF) Mailing Lists", [RFC4633],
      Section 1.

   *  RFC 6702, "Promoting Compliance with Intellectual Property Rights
      (IPR) Disclosure Rules", [RFC6702], Section 5.

   Note that the current description of the Internet Standards Process
   [RFC2026] does not require an update by this document for this
   purpose because the reference to the IETF Executive Director in RFC
   2026 was replaced by a document [RFC3979] that precedes the current
   effort, and that document was, in turn, obsoleted by RFC 8179
   [RFC8179].

3.  Removal of the IETF Executive Director as an Option

   In a few cases, it is no longer appropriate for either the Managing
   Director, IETF Secretariat (former IETF Executive Director position)
   or the new IETF Executive Director (for the LLC) to perform a
   particular historical function.  The relevant documents are updated
   to remove the IETF Executive Director from the list of people with
   specific responsibilities or authority.  Those documents will not be
   updated to use "Managing Director, IETF Secretariat" but, instead,
   the mention of the position will simply be dropped.

   This document applies that change to the following:

   *  RFC 3005, "IETF Discussion List Charter" [RFC3005], section titled
      "Charter for the IETF Discussion List".  This document is modified
      to remove the authorization for the IETF Executive Director to
      restrict people from posting, etc.

4.  Deprecated Documents

4.1.  Documents Whose Context Is Changed by This Specification

   Both of the documents that follow were obsoleted in 2017 by RFC 8179
   [RFC8179], which changed mentions of the IETF Executive Director to
   point to the IETF Secretariat more generally.

   *  RFC 3979 [RFC3979]

   *  RFC 4879 [RFC4879]

4.2.  General Description of the IETF Administrative Model

   RFC 3716 [RFC3716] was a report of an IAB Advisory Committee that
   served as a starting point for the work that led to the original IASA
   structure.  That report was an IAB document rather than an IETF one.
   The IAB approved a proposal to move RFC 3716 to Historic on March 6,
   2019 [IAB-3716-Historic].

5.  Security Considerations

   The changes specified in this document are matters of terminology and
   organizational structure derived from documents it references.  It
   should have no effect on Internet security.

Acknowledgments

   Brian Carpenter's careful checking and identification of documents
   that did, and did not, require consideration was essential to the
   document in its current form.  He also made several other significant
   contributions.  Bob Hinden also gave the document a careful reading
   and made useful suggestions.  In additional to the above, Alissa
   Cooper, Eliot Lear, Heather Flanagan (the RFC Series Editor), and the
   current membership to the IAB helped sort out the handing of RFC
   3716.

Contributors

   Jason Livingood did the hard work of identifying the documents that
   required updating and supplied considerable text used in this
   document.
