1.  Introduction

   An IGP Flexible Algorithm allows IGPs to compute constraint-based
   paths.  The base IGP Flexible Algorithm specification describes how
   it is used with Segment Routing (SR) data planes: SR MPLS and SRv6.

   An IGP Flexible Algorithm as specified in [RFC9350] computes a
   constraint-based path to:

   *  All Flexible-Algorithm-specific Prefix Segment Identifiers (SIDs)
      [RFC8402].

   *  All Flexible-Algorithm-specific SRv6 Locators [RFC8986].

   Therefore, Flexible Algorithm cannot be deployed in the absence of SR
   or SRv6.

   This document extends Flexible Algorithm, allowing it to compute
   paths to IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use Case Example

   In this section, we illustrate one use case that motivates this
   specification: if a specific service can be identified by an IP
   address, traffic to it can use constraint-based paths computed
   according to this specification.

   The System architecture for the 5G System [TS.23.501-3GPP] describes
   the N3 interface between gNodeB and UPF (User Plane Function).

   Mobile networks are becoming more and more IP-centric.  Each end-user
   session from a gNodeB can be destined to a specific UPF based on the
   session requirements.  For example, some sessions require high
   bandwidth, while others need to be routed along the lowest latency
   path.  Each UPF is assigned a unique IP address.  As a result,
   traffic for different sessions is destined to a different destination
   IP address.

   The IP address allocated to the UPF can be associated with an
   algorithm.  The mobile user traffic is then forwarded along the path
   based on the algorithm-specific metric and constraints.  As a result,
   traffic can be sent over a path that is optimized for minimal latency
   or highest bandwidth.  This mechanism is used to achieve Service
   Level Agreement (SLA) appropriate for a user session.

4.  Advertising Flexible Algorithm Definitions (FADs)

   To guarantee loop-free forwarding, all routers that participate in a
   Flex-Algorithm MUST agree on the Flexible Algorithm Definition (FAD).

   Selected nodes within the IGP domain MUST advertise FADs as described
   in Sections 5, 6, and 7 of [RFC9350].

5.  Advertising IP Flexible Algorithm Participation

   A node may use various algorithms when calculating paths to nodes and
   prefixes.  Algorithm values are defined in the "IGP Algorithm Types"
   registry [IANA-ALG].

   Only a node that is participating in a Flex-Algorithm is:

   *  Able to compute a path for such Flex-Algorithm

   *  Part of the topology for such Flex-Algorithm

   Flexible Algorithm participation MUST be advertised for each Flexible
   Algorithm data plane independently, as specified in [RFC9350].  Using
   Flexible Algorithm for regular IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes represents an
   independent Flexible Algorithm data plane; as such, the Flexible
   Algorithm participation for the IP Flexible Algorithm data plane MUST
   be signaled independently of any other Flexible Algorithm data plane
   (e.g., SR).

   All routers in an IGP domain participate in default algorithm 0.
   Advertisement of participation in IP Flexible Algorithm does not
   impact the router participation in default algorithm 0.

   Advertisement of participation in IP Flexible Algorithm does not
   impact the router participation signaled for other data planes.  For
   example, it is possible that a router participates in a particular
   Flex-Algorithm for the IP data plane but does not participate in the
   same Flex-Algorithm for the SR data plane.

   The following sections describe how the IP Flexible Algorithm
   participation is advertised in IGP protocols.

5.1.  The IS-IS IP Algorithm Sub-TLV

   The IS-IS [ISO10589] IP Algorithm Sub-TLV is a sub-TLV of the IS-IS
   Router Capability TLV [RFC7981] and has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   Type        |     Length    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | Algorithm 1   |  Algorithm 2  | Algorithm ... |  Algorithm n  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                    Figure 1: IS-IS IP Algorithm Sub-TLV

   Type (1 octet):  IP Algorithm Sub-TLV (Value 29)

   Length (1 octet):  Variable

   Algorithm (1 octet):  Value from 128 to 255

   The IP Algorithm Sub-TLV MUST be propagated throughout the level and
   MUST NOT be advertised across level boundaries.  Therefore, the S bit
   in the Router Capability TLV, in which the IP Algorithm Sub-TLV is
   advertised, MUST NOT be set.

   The IP Algorithm Sub-TLV is optional.  It MUST NOT be advertised more
   than once at a given level.  A router receiving multiple IP Algorithm
   sub-TLVs from the same originator MUST select the first advertisement
   in the lowest-numbered Link State PDU (LSP), and subsequent instances
   of the IP Algorithm Sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

   Algorithms outside the Flex-Algorithm range (128-255) MUST be ignored
   by the receiver.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   The IP Flex-Algorithm participation advertised in the IS-IS IP
   Algorithm Sub-TLV is topology independent.  When a router advertises
   participation in the IS-IS IP Algorithm Sub-TLV, the participation
   applies to all topologies in which the advertising node participates.

5.2.  The OSPF IP Algorithm TLV

   The OSPF [RFC2328] IP Algorithm TLV is a top-level TLV of the Router
   Information Opaque Link State Advertisement (LSA) [RFC7770] and has
   the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   Algorithm 1 | Algorithm...  |   Algorithm n |               |
     +-                                                             -+
     |                                                               |
     +                                                               +

                      Figure 2: OSPF IP Algorithm TLV

   Type (2 octets):  IP Algorithm TLV (21)

   Length( 2 octets):  Variable

   Algorithm (1 octet):  Value from 128 to 255

   The IP Algorithm TLV is optional.  It MUST only be advertised once in
   the Router Information LSA.

   Algorithms outside the Flex-Algorithm range (128-255) MUST be ignored
   by the receiver.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   When multiple IP Algorithm TLVs are received from a given router, the
   receiver MUST use the first occurrence of the TLV in the Router
   Information LSA.  If the IP Algorithm TLV appears in multiple Router
   Information LSAs that have different flooding scopes, the IP
   Algorithm TLV in the Router Information LSA with the area-scoped
   flooding scope MUST be used.  If the IP Algorithm TLV appears in
   multiple Router Information LSAs that have the same flooding scope,
   the IP Algorithm TLV in the Router Information LSA with the
   numerically smallest Instance ID (Opaque ID for OSPFv2 or Link State
   ID for OSPFv3) MUST be used, and subsequent instances of the IP
   Algorithm TLV MUST be ignored.

   The Router Information LSA can be advertised at any of the defined
   flooding scopes (link, area, or Autonomous System (AS)).  For the
   purpose of IP Algorithm TLV advertisement, area- or AS-scoped
   flooding is REQUIRED.  The AS flooding scope SHOULD NOT be used
   unless local configuration policy on the originating router indicates
   domain-wide flooding.

   The IP Flexible Algorithm participation advertised in the OSPF IP
   Algorithm TLV is topology independent.  When a router advertises
   participation in OSPF IP Algorithm TLV, the participation applies to
   all topologies in which the advertising node participates.

6.  Advertising IP Flexible Algorithm Reachability

   To be able to associate the prefix with the Flex-Algorithm, the
   existing prefix reachability advertisements cannot be used, because
   they advertise the prefix reachability in default algorithm 0.
   Instead, new IP Flexible Algorithm reachability advertisements are
   defined in IS-IS and OSPF.

   The M-flag in the FAD is not applicable to IP Algorithm Prefixes.
   Any IP Algorithm Prefix advertisement includes the Algorithm and
   Metric fields.  When an IP Algorithm Prefix is advertised between
   areas or domains, the metric field in the IP Algorithm Prefix
   advertisement MUST be used irrespective of the M-flag in the FAD
   advertisement.

6.1.  The IS-IS IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV

   The IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability top-level TLV is defined for
   advertising IPv4 Flexible Algorithm Prefix Reachability in IS-IS.

   This new TLV shares the sub-TLV space defined for TLVs Advertising
   Prefix Reachability.

   The IS-IS IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV has the following
   format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   Type        |     Length    |  Rsvd |    MTID               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

           Figure 3: IS-IS IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV

   Type (1 octet):  IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV (Value 126)

   Length (1 octet):  Variable based on number of prefix entries encoded

   Rsvd (4 bits):  Reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero on
      transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   MTID (12 bits):  Multitopology Identifier as defined in [RFC5120].
      Note that the value 0 is legal.

   Followed by one or more prefix entries of the form:

      0                   1                   2                   3

      |D|  Reserved   |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      D-flag:  The D-flag is described as the "up/down bit" in
         Section 4.1 of [RFC5305].  When the Prefix is leaked from level
         2 to level 1, the D bit MUST be set.  Otherwise, this bit MUST
         be clear.  Prefixes with the D bit set MUST NOT be leaked from
         level 1 to level 2.  This is to prevent looping.

      The remaining bits:  Reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to
         zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Algorithm (1 octet):  Associated Algorithm from 128 to 255

   Prefix Len (1 octet):  Prefix length measured in bits

   Prefix (variable length):  Prefix mapped to Flex-Algorithm

   Optional Sub-TLV-length (1 octet):  Number of octets used by sub-TLVs

   Optional sub-TLVs (variable length)

   If the Algorithms in the IS-IS IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV
   are outside the Flex-Algorithm range (128-255), the IS-IS IPv4
   Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV MUST be ignored by the receiver.
   This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   If a router receives multiple IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability
   advertisements for the same prefix from the same originator, it MUST
   select the first advertisement in the lowest-numbered LSP and ignore
   any subsequent IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability advertisements for
   the same prefix.

   If a router receives multiple IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability
   advertisements for the same prefix, from different originators, where
   all of them do not advertise the same algorithm, it MUST ignore all
   of them and MUST NOT install any forwarding entries based on these
   advertisements.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   In cases where a prefix advertisement is received in both an IPv4
   Prefix Reachability TLV [RFC5305] [RFC5120] and an IPv4 Algorithm
   Prefix Reachability TLV, the IPv4 Prefix Reachability advertisement
   MUST be preferred when installing entries in the forwarding plane.

6.2.  The IS-IS IPv6 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV

   The IS-IS IPv6 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV is identical to the
   IS-IS IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV, except that it has a
   distinct type.  The type is 127.

   If the Algorithms in the IS-IS IPv6 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV
   are outside the Flex-Algorithm range (128-255), the IS-IS IPv6
   Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV MUST be ignored by the receiver.
   This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   If a router receives multiple IPv6 Algorithm Prefix Reachability
   advertisements for the same prefix from the same originator, it MUST
   select the first advertisement in the lowest-numbered LSP and ignore
   any subsequent IPv6 Algorithm Prefix Reachability advertisements for
   the same prefix.

   If a router receives multiple IPv6 Algorithm Prefix Reachability
   advertisements for the same prefix, from different originators, where
   all of them do not advertise the same algorithm, it MUST ignore all
   of them and MUST NOT install any forwarding entries based on these
   advertisements.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   In cases where a prefix advertisement is received in both an IPv6
   Prefix Reachability TLV [RFC5308] [RFC5120] and an IPv6 Algorithm
   Prefix Reachability TLV, the IPv6 Prefix Reachability advertisement
   MUST be preferred when installing entries in the forwarding plane.

   In cases where a prefix advertisement is received in both an IS-IS
   SRv6 Locator TLV [RFC9352] and in IS-IS IPv6 Algorithm Prefix
   Reachability TLV, the receiver MUST ignore both of them and MUST NOT
   install any forwarding entries based on these advertisements.  This
   situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

6.3.  The OSPFv2 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV is defined for
   advertising IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability in OSPFv2, the OSPFv2 IP
   Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV.

   The OSPFv2 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV has the following
   format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |       MT-ID   |  Algorithm    |     Flags     |     Reserved  |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                          Metric                               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 5: OSPFv2 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV

   Type (2 octets):  The value is 6

   Length (2 octets):  8

   MT-ID (1 octet):  Multi-Topology ID as defined in [RFC4915]

   Algorithm (1 octet):  Associated Algorithm from 128 to 255

   Flags (1 octet):  The following flags are defined:

       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |E|   Reserved    |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      Where:

      E bit:  The same as the E bit defined in Appendix A.4.5 of
         [RFC2328].

      The remaining bits:  Reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to
         zero on transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   Reserved (1 octet):  SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be
      ignored on reception.

   Metric (4 octets):  The algorithm-specific metric value.  The metric
      value of 0XFFFFFFFF MUST be considered unreachable.

   If the Algorithms in the OSPFv2 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-
   TLV are outside the Flex-Algorithm range (128-255), the OSPFv2 IP
   Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   An OSPFv2 router receiving multiple OSPFv2 IP Algorithm Prefix
   Reachability Sub-TLVs in the same OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV MUST
   select the first advertisement of this sub-TLV and MUST ignore all
   remaining occurrences of this sub-TLV in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix
   TLV.

   An OSPFv2 router receiving multiple OSPFv2 IP Algorithm Prefix
   Reachability TLVs for the same prefix from different originators
   where all of them do not advertise the same algorithm MUST ignore all
   of them and MUST NOT install any forwarding entries based on these
   advertisements.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   In cases where a prefix advertisement is received in any of the LSAs
   advertising the prefix reachability for algorithm 0 and in an OSPFv2
   IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV, only the prefix
   reachability advertisement for algorithm 0 MUST be used, and all
   occurrences of the OSPFv2 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV
   MUST be ignored.

   When computing the IP Algorithm Prefix reachability in OSPFv2, only
   information present in the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV MUST be used.
   There will not be any information advertised for the IP Algorithm
   Prefix in any of the OSPFv2 LSAs that advertise prefix reachability
   for algorithm 0.  For the IP Algorithm Prefix, the OSPFv2 Extended
   Prefix TLV is used to advertise the prefix reachability, unlike for
   algorithm 0 prefixes, where the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV is only
   used to advertise additional attributes -- but not the reachability
   itself.

6.3.1.  The OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address Sub-TLV

   A new sub-TLV of the OSPFv2 Extended Prefix TLV is defined for
   advertising IP Forwarding Address, the OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address
   Sub-TLV.

   The OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address Sub-TLV has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   Type (2 octets):  The value is 7

   Length (2 octets):  4

   Forwarding Address (4 octets):  The same as defined in Appendix A.4.5
      of [RFC2328]

   The OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address Sub-TLV MUST NOT be used for
   computing algorithm 0 prefix reachability and MUST be ignored for
   algorithm 0 prefixes.

   The OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address Sub-TLV is optional.  If it is not
   present, the forwarding address for computing the IP Algorithm Prefix
   reachability is assumed to be equal to 0.0.0.0.

   The OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address Sub-TLV is only applicable to AS
   External and Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA) External route types.  If the
   OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address Sub-TLV is advertised in the OSPFv2
   Extended Prefix TLV that has the Route Type field set to any other
   type, the OSPFv2 IP Forwarding Address Sub-TLV MUST be ignored.

6.4.  The OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV

   The OSPFv3 [RFC5340] IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV is
   defined for advertisement of the IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability in
   OSPFv3.

   The OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV is a sub-TLV of
   the following OSPFv3 TLVs defined in [RFC8362]:

   *  Intra-Area-Prefix TLV

   *  Inter-Area-Prefix TLV

   *  External-Prefix TLV

   The format of OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV is
   shown below:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 7: OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV

   Where:

   Type (2 octets):  The value is 35

   Length (2 octets):  8

   Algorithm (1 octet):  Associated Algorithm from 128 to 255

   Reserved (3 octets):  SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be
      ignored on reception.

   Metric (4 octets):  The algorithm-specific metric value.  The metric
      value of 0XFFFFFFFF MUST be considered unreachable.

   If the Algorithms in the OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-
   TLV are outside the Flex-Algorithm range (128-255), the OSPFv3 IP
   Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   When the OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV is present,
   the NU-bit in the PrefixOptions field of the parent TLV MUST be set.
   This is needed to prevent the OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability
   advertisement from contributing to the base algorithm reachability.
   If the NU-bit in the PrefixOptions field of the parent TLV is not
   set, the OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Sub-TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.

   The metric value in the parent TLV is RECOMMENDED to be set to
   LSInfinity [RFC2328].  This recommendation is provided as a network
   troubleshooting convenience; if it is not followed, the protocol will
   still function correctly.

   An OSPFv3 router receiving multiple OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix
   Reachability Sub-TLVs in the same parent TLV MUST select the first
   advertisement of this sub-TLV and MUST ignore all remaining
   occurrences of this sub-TLV in the parent TLV.

   An OSPFv3 router receiving multiple OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix
   Reachability TLVs for the same prefix from different originators
   where all of them do not advertise the same algorithm MUST ignore all
   of them and MUST NOT install any forwarding entries based on these
   advertisements.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   In cases where a prefix advertisement is received in any of the LSAs
   advertising the prefix reachability for algorithm 0 and in an OSPFv3
   OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV, only the prefix
   reachability advertisement for algorithm 0 MUST be used, and all
   occurrences of the OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability Sub-TLV
   MUST be ignored.

   In cases where a prefix advertisement is received in both an OSPFv3
   SRv6 Locator TLV and in an OSPFv3 IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability
   Sub-TLV, the receiver MUST ignore both of them and MUST NOT install
   any forwarding entries based on these advertisements.  This situation
   SHOULD be logged as an error.

6.5.  The OSPF IP Flexible Algorithm ASBR Metric Sub-TLV

   [RFC9350] defines the OSPF Flexible Algorithm ASBR Metric (FAAM) Sub-
   TLV that is used by an OSPFv2 or an OSPFv3 Area Border Router (ABR)
   to advertise a Flex-Algorithm-specific metric associated with the
   corresponding ASBR LSA.

   As described in [RFC9350], each data plane signals its participation
   independently.  IP Flexible Algorithm participation is signaled
   independent of SR Flexible Algorithm participation.  As a result, the
   calculated topologies for SR and IP Flexible Algorithm could be
   different.  Such a difference prevents the usage of FAAM for the
   purpose of the IP Flexible Algorithm.

   The OSPF IP Flexible Algorithm ASBR Metric (IPFAAM) Sub-TLV is
   defined for the advertisement of the IP Flex-Algorithm-specific
   metric associated with an ASBR by the ABR.

   The IPFAAM Sub-TLV is a sub-TLV of the:

   *  OSPFv2 Extended Inter-Area ASBR TLV, as defined in [RFC9350]

   *  OSPFv3 Inter-Area-Router TLV, as defined in [RFC8362]

   The OSPF IPFAAM Sub-TLV has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |              Type             |             Length            |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |   Algorithm   |                   Reserved                    |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                            Metric                             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

          Figure 8: OSPF IP Flexible Algorithm ASBR Metric Sub-TLV

   Where:

   Type (2 octets):  2 (allocated by IANA) for OSPFv2, 36 for OSPFv3

   Length (2 octets):  8

   Algorithm (1 octet):  Associated Algorithm from 128 to 255

   Reserved (3 octets):  SHOULD be set to 0 on transmission and MUST be
      ignored on reception

   Metric (4 octets):  The algorithm-specific metric value

   If the Algorithms in the OSPF IP Flexible Algorithm ASBR Metric Sub-
   TLV are outside the Flex-Algorithm range (128-255), the OSPF IP
   Flexible Algorithm ASBR Metric Sub-TLV MUST be ignored by the
   receiver.  This situation SHOULD be logged as an error.

   The usage of the IPFAAM Sub-TLV is similar to the usage of the FAAM
   Sub-TLV defined in [RFC9350], but it is used to advertise IP Flexible
   Algorithm metric.

   An OSPF ABR MUST include the OSPF IPFAAM Sub-TLVs as part of any IP
   Flexible Algorithm ASBR reachability advertisement between areas.

   The FAAM Sub-TLV as defined in [RFC9350] MUST NOT be used during IP
   Flexible Algorithm path calculation; the IPFAAM Sub-TLV MUST be used
   instead.

7.  Calculating of IP Flexible Algorithm Paths

   The IP Flexible Algorithm is considered as yet another data plane of
   the Flexible Algorithm as described in [RFC9350].

   Participation in the IP Flexible Algorithm is signaled as described
   in Section 5 and is specific to the IP Flexible Algorithm data plane.

   Calculation of IP Flexible Algorithm paths follows what is described
   in [RFC9350].  This computation uses the IP Flexible Algorithm data
   plane participation and is independent of the Flexible Algorithm
   calculation done for any other Flexible Algorithm data plane (e.g.,
   SR, SRv6).

   The IP Flexible Algorithm data plane only considers participating
   nodes during the Flexible Algorithm calculation.  When computing
   paths for a given Flex-Algorithm, all nodes that do not advertise
   participation for such IP Flex-Algorithm, as described in Section 5,
   MUST be pruned from the topology.

8.  IP Flexible Algorithm Forwarding

   The IP Algorithm Prefix Reachability advertisement as described in
   Section 5 includes the MTID value that associates the prefix with a
   specific topology.  Algorithm Prefix Reachability advertisement also
   includes an Algorithm value that explicitly associates the prefix
   with a specific Flex-Algorithm.  The paths to the prefix MUST be
   calculated using the specified Flex-Algorithm in the associated
   topology.

   Forwarding entries for the IP Flex-Algorithm prefixes advertised in
   IGPs MUST be installed in the forwarding plane of the receiving IP
   Flex-Algorithm prefix capable routers when they participate in the
   associated topology and algorithm.  Forwarding entries for IP Flex-
   Algorithm prefixes associated with Flex-Algorithms in which the node
   is not participating MUST NOT be installed in the forwarding plane.

9.  Deployment Considerations

   IGP Flexible Algorithm can be used by many data planes.  The original
   specification was done for SR and SRv6; this specification adds IP as
   another data plane that can use IGP Flexible Algorithm.  Other data
   planes may be defined in the future.  This section provides some
   details about the coexistence of the various data planes of an IGP
   Flexible Algorithm.

   Flexible Algorithm Definition (FAD), as described in [RFC9350], is
   data plane independent and is used by all Flexible Algorithm data
   planes.

   Participation in the Flexible Algorithm, as described in [RFC9350],
   is data plane specific.

   Calculation of the Flexible Algorithm paths is data plane specific
   and uses data-plane-specific participation advertisements.

   Data-plane-specific participation and calculation guarantee that the
   forwarding of the traffic over the Flex-Algorithm data-plane-specific
   paths is consistent between all nodes that apply the IGP Flex-
   Algorithm to the data plane.

   Multiple data planes can use the same Flex-Algorithm value at the
   same time and, and as such, share the FAD for it.  For example, SR-
   MPLS and IP can both use a common Flex-Algorithm.  Traffic for SR-
   MPLS will be forwarded based on Flex-Algorithm-specific SR SIDs.
   Traffic for IP Flex-Algorithm will be forwarded based on Flex-
   Algorithm-specific prefix reachability advertisements.  Note that for
   a particular Flex-Algorithm, for a particular IP prefix, there will
   only be path(s) calculated and installed for a single data plane.

10.  Protection

   In many networks where IGP Flexible Algorithms are deployed, IGP
   restoration will be fast and additional protection mechanisms will
   not be required.  IGP restoration may be enhanced by Equal Cost
   Multipath (ECMP).

   In other networks, operators can deploy additional protection
   mechanisms.  The following are examples:

   *  Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs) [RFC5286]

   *  Remote Loop-Free Alternates (R-LFAs) [RFC7490]

   LFA and R-LFA computations MUST be restricted to the Flex-Algorithm
   topology and the computed backup next hops should be programmed for
   the IP Flex-Algorithm prefixes.

11.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates the "OSPF Router Information (RI) TLVs"
   registry as follows:

             +=======+==============+=======================+

                                  Table 3

   Since the above TLVs share the sub-TLV space managed in the "IS-IS
   Sub-TLVs for TLVs Advertising Prefix Reachability" registry, IANA has
   added "IPv4 Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV (126)" and "IPv6
   Algorithm Prefix Reachability TLV (127)" to the list of TLVs in the
   description of that registry.

   In addition, columns headed "126" and "127" have been added to that

12.  Security Considerations

   This document inherits security considerations from [RFC9350].

   This document adds one new way to disrupt IGP networks that are using
   Flexible Algorithm: an attacker can suppress reachability for a given
   prefix whose reachability is advertised by a legitimate node for a
   particular IP Flex-Algorithm X by advertising the same prefix in
   Flex-Algorithm Y from another malicious node.  (To see why this is,
   consider, for example, the rule given in the second-to-last paragraph
   of Section 6.1).

   This attack can be addressed by the existing security extensions, as
   described in [RFC5304] and [RFC5310] for IS-IS, in [RFC2328] and
   [RFC7474] for OSPFv2, and in [RFC4552] and [RFC5340] for OSPFv3.

   If a node that is authenticated is taken over by an attacker, such a
   rogue node can perform the attack described above.  Such an attack is
   not preventable through authentication, and it is not different from
   advertising any other incorrect information through IS-IS or OSPF.
