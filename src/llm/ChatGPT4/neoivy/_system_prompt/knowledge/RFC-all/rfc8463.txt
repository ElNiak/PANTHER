1.  Introduction

   DKIM [RFC6376] signs email messages by creating hashes of selected
   message header fields and body and signing the header hash with a
   digital signature.  Message recipients fetch the signature
   verification key from the DNS.  The defining documents specify a
   single signing algorithm, RSA [RFC3447] (which has since been
   obsoleted by [RFC8017]).

   This document adds a new, stronger signing algorithm, Edwards-Curve
   Digital Signature Algorithm, using the Curve25519 curve (Ed25519),
   which has much shorter keys than RSA for similar levels of security.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Syntax descriptions use Augmented BNF (ABNF) [RFC5234].  The ABNF
   tokens sig-a-tag-k and key-k-tag-type are imported from [RFC6376].

RFC 8463                   DKIM Crypto Update             September 2018


3.  Ed25519-SHA256 Signing Algorithm

   The Ed25519-SHA256 signing algorithm computes a message hash as
   defined in Section 3 of [RFC6376] using SHA-256 [FIPS-180-4-2015] as
   the hash-alg.  It signs the hash with the PureEdDSA variant Ed25519,
   as defined in RFC 8032, Section 5.1 [RFC8032].  Example keys and
   signatures in Appendix A are based on the test vectors in RFC 8032,
   Section 7.1 [RFC8032].

   The DNS record for the verification public key has a "k=ed25519" tag
   to indicate that the key is an Ed25519 rather than an RSA key.

   This is an additional DKIM signature algorithm added to Section 3.3
   of [RFC6376] as envisioned in Section 3.3.4 of that document.

   Note: since Ed25519 public keys are 256 bits long, the base64-encoded
   key is only 44 octets, so DNS key record data will generally fit in a
   single 255-byte TXT string and work even with DNS provisioning
   software that doesn't handle multistring TXT records.

4.  Signature and Key Syntax

   The syntax of DKIM signatures and DKIM keys are updated as follows.

4.1.  Signature Syntax

   The syntax of DKIM algorithm tags in Section 3.5 of [RFC6376] is
   updated by adding this rule to the existing rule for sig-a-tag-k:

       ABNF:

       sig-a-tag-k =/ "ed25519"

4.2.  Key Syntax

   The syntax of DKIM key tags in Section 3.6.1 of [RFC6376] is updated
   by adding this rule to the existing rule for key-k-tag-type:

       ABNF:

       key-k-tag-type  =/ "ed25519"

   The p= value in the key record is the Ed25519 public key encoded in
   base64.  Since the key is 256 bits long, the base64 text is 44 octets
   long.  See Appendix A.2 for a sample key record using the public key
   in [RFC8032], Section 7.1, Test 1.

5.  Choice and Strength of Keys and Algorithms

   Section 3.3 of [RFC6376] describes DKIM's hash and signature
   algorithms.  It is updated as follows:

   Signers SHOULD implement and verifiers MUST implement the
   Ed25519-SHA256 algorithm.

6.  Transition Considerations

   For backward compatibility, signers can add multiple signatures that
   use old and new signing algorithms.  Since there can only be a single
   key record in the DNS for each selector, the signatures have to use
   different selectors, although they can use the same d= and i=
   identifiers.

   The example message in Appendix A has two signatures with the same d=
   and i= identifiers but different a= algorithms and s= selectors.

7.  Security Considerations

   All of the security advice in [RFC6376] continues to apply, except
   that the security advice about Ed25519 in Section 8 of [RFC8032]
   supplants the advice about RSA threats.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated a registry as follows.

8.1.  "DKIM Key Type" Registry

   The following value has been added to the "DKIM Key Type" registry:

                     +---------+-----------+--------+
                     |   TYPE  | REFERENCE | STATUS |
                     +---------+-----------+--------+
                     | ed25519 | [RFC8032] | active |
                     +---------+-----------+--------+

           Table 1: Value Added to the "DKIM Key Type" Registry

Appendix A.  Example of a Signed Message

   This is a small message with both RSA-SHA256 and Ed25519-SHA256 DKIM
   signatures.  The signatures are independent of each other, so either
   signature would be valid if the other were not present.
