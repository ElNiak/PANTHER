RFC 1304                      SIP Objects                  February 1992


1.  The Network Management Framework

   The Internet-standard Network Management Framework consists of three
   components.  They are:

      RFC 1155 [3] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
      describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.  RFC
      1212 [9] defines a more concise description mechanism, which is
      wholly consistent with the SMI.

      RFC 1156 [4] which defines MIB-I, the core set of managed objects
      for the Internet suite of protocols.  RFC 1213 [6], defines MIB-
      II, an evolution of MIB-I based on implementation experience and
      new operational requirements.

      RFC 1157 [5] which defines the SNMP, the protocol used for network
      access to managed objects.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

2.  Objects

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   International Standard 8824 [7] defined in the SMI.  In particular,
   each object has a name, a syntax, and an encoding.  The name is an
   object identifier, an administratively assigned name, which specifies
   an object type.  The object type together with an object instance
   serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.
   For human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
   OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the object type.

   The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data structure
   corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 language is used for
   this purpose.  However, the SMI RFC 1155 [3] purposely restricts the
   ASN.1 constructs which may be used.  These restrictions are
   explicitly made for simplicity.

   The encoding of an object type is simply how that object type is
   represented using the object type's syntax.  Implicitly tied to the
   notion of an object type's syntax and encoding is how the object type
   is represented when being transmitted on the network.  The SMI
   specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of ASN.1 International
   Standard 8825 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by
   the SNMP.

RFC 1304                      SIP Objects                  February 1992


2.1.  Format of Definitions

   Section 4 contains contains the specification of all object types
   contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined using the
   conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the extensions
   specified in RFC 1212 [9].

3.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a SIP interface.  At present, this applies to
   these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

                  sip (31)

   For these interfaces, the value of the ifSpecific variable in the
   MIB-II [6] has the OBJECT IDENTIFIER value:

               sip    OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { transmission 31 }

   The definitions contained herein are based on the SIP specifications
   in Bellcore TR-TSV-000772 and TR-TSV-000773 [11,12].

   The SIP (SMDS Interface Protocol) protocol stack is defined as
   follows in TR-TSV-000772 [11]:

                               ___________________
                              |                   |
                              | SIP Level 3 [11]  |
                              |___________________|
                              |                   |
                              | SIP Level 2 [11]  |
                              |___________________|
                              |                   |
                              | PLCP [12]         |
                              |___________________|
                              |                   |
                              | DS1 or DS3 [12]   |
                              |___________________|

   The PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Procedure) adapts the
   capabilities of the transmission system (DS1 or DS3 formats) to the
   service expected by SIP Level 2.  Managed objects for DS1 and DS3
   Interface Types are defined in RFC 1232 [13] and RFC 1233 [14]
   respectively (and amended in RFC 1239 [17]), and can be utilized for
   management of SIP interfaces. This document defines managed objects
   for the remaining protocol levels of the SIP Interface Type.  This
   document does not specify objects for the management of subscription

   or configuration of Subscriber-Network Interfaces (SNIs). Those
   objects are defined in Definitions of Managed Objects for SMDS
   Subscription [18]. Bellcore requirements on these objects are
   specified in TA-TSV-001062 [16].

                      of the SIP L3PDU which extends from the
                      Destination Address field up to and including the

                      the PAD field (if the CRC32 field is not present).
                      As an optional check, an error is considered to
                      have occurred when the length of a partially
                      received SIP L3PDU exceeds the BAsize value.
