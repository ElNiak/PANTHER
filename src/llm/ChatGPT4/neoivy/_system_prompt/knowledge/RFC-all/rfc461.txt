                  TELNET Protocol Meeting Announcement

Since the publication of RFC #318 there have been a great number of
proposals for changes and/or extensions to the (still unofficial) TELNET
Protocol. It now seems appropriate to have a meeting of concerned
parties to try, once again, to reach a consensus position and define an
"official" protocol (with perhaps, some room for optional expansion).

Accordingly, I hereby announce a TELNET Protocol meeting to be held at
UCLA on Monday, March 5. I  expect this to be a working meeting (rather
than a tutorial to bring new members of the network community up-to-
speed) and therefore wish to invite the attendance of only those
individuals prepared to discuss at LEAST those issues which have already
been raised.  At a minimum, attendees should be familiar with the
following:

    RFC 318
    RFC 328
    RFC 340
    RFC 357
    RFC 393
    RFC 426
    RFC 435

A familiarity with deliberations of the TELNET Committee prior to RFC
318 would probably also be helpful.  Finally, attendees should be aware
that there are few (no?) Hosts which follow the echo-control conventions
described in RFC 318.

Anyone wishing to attend this meeting should contact Alex McKenzie at
BBN (NIC ident aam) 50 Moulton Street, Cambridge, Mass. 02l38.  My
telephone number is

    (617) 491-1850 ext. 441

When there is some indication of the number of individuals planning to
attend, a meeting room will be selected, a time announced, etc.
