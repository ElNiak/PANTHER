                   Definitions of Managed Objects for
                Network Time Protocol Version 4 (NTPv4)

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used in networks of all types and
   sizes for time synchronization of servers, workstations, and other
   networked equipment.  As time synchronization is more and more a
   mission-critical service, standardized means for monitoring and
   management of this subsystem of a networked host are required to
   allow operators of such a service to set up a monitoring system that
   is platform- and vendor-independent.  This document provides a
   standardized collection of data objects for monitoring the NTP entity
   of such a network participant and it is part of the NTP version 4
   standardization effort.

1.  Introduction

   The NTPv4 MIB module is designed to allow Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP) to be used to monitor and manage local NTP [RFC5905]
   entities.  It provides a collection of data objects that can be
   queried using the SNMP protocol and represent the current status of
   the NTP entity.  This includes general information about the NTP
   entity itself (vendor, product, version) as well as connectivity to
   upstream NTP servers used as sources of reference time and to
   hardware reference clocks like radio clocks.  The most important
   values are included in order to be able to detect failures before
   they can have an impact on the overall time synchronization status of
   the network.  There are also a collection of notification objects to
   inform about state changes in the NTP entity.  There are objects to
   control these notifications as well.

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Technical Description

   The NTPv4 MIB module is divided into sections for general server
   information, current NTP entity status, status information of all
   mobilized associations (e.g., unicast upstream time servers,
   multicast or broadcast, time references, and hardware clocks), NTP
   entity control objects, NTP objects used only for notifications, as
   well as SNMP notification definitions for core events.

   The general server information section contains static information
   and can be queried to identify which NTP implementation is running on
   a host.  This includes the vendor and product name of the running NTP
   software as well as version information, hardware/os platform
   identity, and the time resolution of the underlying OS.

   Section 2 (current NTP status) includes data objects that represent
   the current operational status of the NTP entity.

   The third section contains data objects that represent the set of
   time references ("associations") with which the NTP entity is
   currently working.

   The fourth section contains objects that can be used to control the
   NTP entity.  The currently defined objects control how often the
   heartbeat interval notification is sent out and which notifications
   are enabled.

RFC 5907        Definitions of Managed Objects for NTPv4       June 2010


   The fifth section contains objects that are only used as varbinds in
   notifications.  There is currently only one object in this section --
   a message that adds a cleartext event message to notifications.

   Certain important events can occur while the NTP entity is running.
   The notification section defines SNMP notifications for a collection
   of the most important ones ("core events") and additionally provides
   a heartbeat notification as well as a test notification to allow
   management systems to test the reception of NTP-related notifications
   as well as enable heartbeat-based monitoring systems to assure that
   the NTP entity is still up and running.

   Some values are included both in numeric and in human-readable
   (string) format.  This has been done to simplify the representation
   of a status information.  If the two representations of a certain
   value differ, the numeric representation takes precedence.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

            Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
            ----------        -----------------------

            ntpSnmp           { mib-2 197 }

7.  Security Considerations

   There are currently two management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the objects and their sensitivity/
   vulnerability:

   ntpEntHeartbeatInterval controls the interval of heartbeat
   notifications.  If set to 1, this will cause the NTP entity to send
   one notification each second.  This is the maximum rate (1/s) that
   can be generated automatically.  If it is set to 0, then one single
   hearbeat notification will be created and no further automatically
   generated notification is sent.  This functionality can be used to
   create notifications at a higher rate (as high as the object can be
   written).

   ntpEntNotifBits enables/disables notifications.  Could be used to
   switch off notifications in order to delay or eliminate the
   notification for critical and important events.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   ntpEntSoftwareName, ntpEntSoftwareVersion, ntpEntSoftwareVendor, and
   ntpEntSystemType all can be used to identify software and its version
   as well as the operating system and hardware platform.  This might
   help a potential attacker to find security problems and therefore can
   be used in the preparation of an attack.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.  It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the
   security features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see RFC 3410
   [RFC3410], section 8), including full support for the SNMPv3
   cryptographic mechanisms (for authentication and privacy).  Further,
   deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
   Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable
   cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
