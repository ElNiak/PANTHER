RFC 6003               Ethernet Traffic Parameters          October 2010


1.  Introduction

   Per [RFC3471], Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   allows the inclusion of technology-specific parameters in signaling.
   This document introduces Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC-specific
   objects in support of Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet traffic
   parameters as specified in [MEF10.1] and ITU-T Ethernet Service
   Switching as discussed in [RFC6004].  For example:

   o  For Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services [MEF6], these traffic
      parameters are applicable to each Ethernet Virtual Connection
      (EVC) crossing a given port.

   o  For Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services [MEF6], these
      traffic parameters are applicable per Ethernet Virtual Connection
      (EVC) with a single or multiple Class of Service (CoS),
      independent of its associated Virtual LAN ID (VID) or set of VIDs.

      Association between EVC and VIDs is detailed in [MEF10.1].  The
      format and encoding of the VID (or set of VIDs) is documented in a
      companion document [RFC6004].

   This does not preclude broader usage of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and
   FLOWSPEC-specific objects specified this document.  For instance,
   they may also be used for signaling Ethernet Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs), in the Generalized Label Request (see [RFC3471]), the
   Switching Type field is set to Layer 2 Switching Capability (L2SC)
   and the LSP Encoding Type field to Ethernet.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Moreover, the reader is assumed to be familiar with the terminology
   in [MEF10.1] as well as in [RFC3471] and [RFC3473].

3.  Overview

   In GMPLS RSVP-TE [RFC3473], the SENDER_TSPEC object is used on a Path
   message to indicate the bandwidth that is requested for the LSP being
   established, and the FLOWSPEC object is used on a Resv message to
   indicate the bandwidth actually reserved for the LSP.  The Ethernet
   SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet link type
   (switching granularity) of the requested LSP and the MTU value for

RFC 6003               Ethernet Traffic Parameters          October 2010


   the LSP.  Other information about the requested bandwidth
   characteristics of the LSP are carried in the Bandwidth Profile as a
   TLV within the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object.

   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC object includes the Ethernet link
   type (switching granularity) of the requested LSP and the MTU value
   for the LSP.

   The Bandwidth Profile defines the set of traffic parameters
   applicable to a sequence of Service Frames, referred to as bandwidth
   profile parameters (as specified in [MEF10.1]):

   o  Committed Rate: indicates the rate at which traffic commits to be
      sent to the Ethernet LSP.  The committed rate is described in
      terms of the CIR (Committed Information Rate) and CBS (Committed
      Burst Size) traffic parameters.

      o  CIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time)
         up to which the network is committed to transfer frames and
         meets its performance objectives.

      o  CBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units
         (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the
         interface speed to remain CIR-conformant.

   o  Excess Rate: indicates the extent by which the traffic sent on an
      Ethernet LSP exceeds the committed rate.  The Excess Rate is
      described in terms of the EIR (Excess Information Rate) and EBS
      (Excess Burst Size) traffic parameters.

      o  EIR is defined as the average rate (in bytes per unit of time),
         in excess of the CIR, up to which the network may transfer
         frames without any performance objectives.

      o  EBS defines a limit on the maximum number of information units
         (e.g., bytes) available for a burst of frames sent at the
         interface speed to remain EIR-conformant.

   o  Color mode (CM): indicates whether the "color-aware" or "color-
      blind" property is employed by the bandwidth profile.

   o  Coupling flag (CF): allows the choice between two modes of
      operation of the rate enforcement algorithm.

4.1.  Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV

   The Type 2 TLV specifies the Ethernet Bandwidth Profile (BW profile).
   It defines an upper bound on the volume of the expected service
   frames belonging to a particular Ethernet service instance.  The
   Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object MAY include more than one Ethernet
   Bandwidth Profile TLV.

   The Type 2 TLV has the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3

   Profile: 8 bits

      This field is defined as a bit vector of binary flags.  The
      following flags are defined:

         Flag 1 (bit 0): Coupling Flag (CF)
         Flag 2 (bit 1): Color Mode (CM)

      Where bit 0 is the low order bit.  Other flags are reserved, they
      SHOULD be set to zero when sent, and SHOULD be ignored when
      received.

      A flag is set to value 1 to indicate that the corresponding
      metering profile is requested.

      The Flag 1 (CF) allows the choice between two modes of operation
      of the rate enforcement algorithm.

      The Flag 2 (CM) indicates whether the color-aware or color-blind
      property [MEF10.2] is employed by the bandwidth profile.  When
      Flag 2 is set to value 0 (1), the bandwidth profile algorithm is
      said to be in color-blind (color-aware) mode.

RFC 6003               Ethernet Traffic Parameters          October 2010


   Index: 8 bits

      The Index field is used to reference bandwidth allocated for a
      given traffic class in case a multiple-class LSP is being
      requested.  The Index field value MUST correspond to at least one
      of the Class-Type values included either in the CLASSTYPE object
      [RFC4124] or in the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object [MCOS].

      A given index value j can be associated to at most N Class-Type
      values CTi (i =< N) of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object.  This
      association applies when a set of one or more CTIs maps to a
      single (shared) BW profile.  An example of value setting consists
      in assigning an arbitrary value comprised within the range
      [0x08,0xF8] associated to a set of CTi, the values in the range
      [0xF8,0xFF] being selected for reserved sets.  This allows mapping
      to one of 248 predefined CTi sets.

      A given index value j can be associated to a single CTi (1:1
      correspondence).  In this case, the index value setting consists
      in assigning the 3 least significant bits of the Index field
      itself to the CTi value itself (comprised in the range
      [0x00,0x07]).  This applies in case a single CTi maps a single
      (dedicated) BW profile or multiple (dedicated) BW profiles.  In
      the former case, the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object includes a
      single Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV.  In the latter case, the
      Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC includes a set of more than one Ethernet
      Bandwidth Profile TLVs (whose respective index value is associated
      to a single CTi value).

      Note that the current specification allows for combining shared
      and dedicated BW profiles to the same LSP.  That is, an Ethernet
      SENDER_TSPEC object MAY include multiple Ethernet Bandwidth
      Profile TLVs whose respective index can be associated on a 1:1
      basis to a single CTi or to a set of multiple CTis.

      For each subobject of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object [MCOS]:

         o  Each CTi value SHOULD correspond 1:1 to the MEF Customer
            Edge VLAN CoS (CE-VLAN CoS).

         o  The BW requested per CTi field MAY be used for bandwidth
            accounting purposes.

      By default, the value of the Index field MUST be set to 0.

RFC 6003               Ethernet Traffic Parameters          October 2010


   Reserved: 16 bits

      These bits SHOULD be set to zero when sent and MUST be ignored
      when received.

   CIR (Committed Information Rate): 32 bits

      The value of the CIR is in units of bytes per second.  The CIR is
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number
      (see [RFC4506]).

      The CIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0.

   CBS (Committed Burst Size): 32 bits

      The value of the CBS is in units of bytes.  The CBS is encoded as
      a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see
      [RFC4506]).

      When CIR is strictly greater than 0 (CIR > 0), the CBS MUST be
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size.

   EIR (Excess Information Rate): 32 bits

      The value of the EIR is in units of bytes per second.  The EIR is
      encoded as a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number
      (see [RFC4506]).

      The EIR value MUST be greater than or equal to 0.

   EBS (Excess Burst Size): 32 bits

      The value of the EBS is in units of bytes.  The EBS is encoded as
      a 32-bit IEEE single-precision floating-point number (see
      [RFC4506]).

      When EIR is strictly greater than 0 (EIR > 0), the EBS MUST be
      greater than or equal to the maximum frame size.

5.  Ethernet FLOWSPEC Object

   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object (Class-Num = 9, Class-Type = 6) has the
   same format as the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object.

6.  Ethernet ADSPEC Object

   There is no ADSPEC object associated with the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC
   object.

RFC 6003               Ethernet Traffic Parameters          October 2010


   Either the ADSPEC object is omitted or an IntServ ADSPEC with the
   Default General Characterization Parameters and Guaranteed Service
   fragment is used, see [RFC2210].

7.  Processing

   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC and FLOWSPEC objects specified in this
   document MAY be used for signaling Ethernet LSP.  For signaling such
   an LSP, in the Generalized LABEL_REQUEST object (see [RFC3471]), the
   Switching Type field MUST be set to the value 51 (L2SC) and the LSP
   Encoding Type field MUST be set to the value 2 (Ethernet).

   The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object carries the traffic specification
   generated by the RSVP session sender.  The Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC
   object SHOULD be forwarded and delivered unchanged to both
   intermediate and egress nodes.

   The Ethernet FLOWSPEC object carries reservation request information
   generated by receivers.  As with any FLOWSPEC object, the Ethernet
   FLOWSPEC object flows upstream toward the ingress node.

   Intermediate and egress nodes MUST verify that the node itself and
   the interfaces on which the LSP will be established can support the
   requested Switching Granularity, MTU and values included in subobject
   TLVs.  These nodes MUST be configured with the same predefined CT
   sets as the index value signaled as part of the Index field of the
   Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV (see Section 4.1).  If the requested
   value(s) cannot be supported, the receiver node MUST generate a
   PathErr message with the error code "Traffic Control Error" and the
   error value "Service unsupported" (see [RFC2205]).

   In addition, if the MTU field is received with a value smaller than
   the minimum transfer unit size of the Ethernet frame (e.g., 46 bytes
   for Ethernet v2, 38 bytes for IEEE 802.3), the node MUST generate a
   PathErr message with the error code "Traffic Control Error" and the
   error value "Bad Tspec value" (see [RFC2205]).

   Error processing of the CLASSTYPE object follows rules defined in
   [RFC4124].  Error processing of the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object follows
   rules defined in [MCOS].  Moreover, a Label Switching Router (LSR)
   receiving a Path message with the EXTENDED_CLASSTYPE object, which
   recognizes the object and the particular Class-Type but does detect a
   mismatch in the index values, MUST send a PathErr message towards the
   sender with the error code "Extended Class-Type Error" and the error
   value "Class-Type mismatch" (see [RFC2205]).

8.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations to [RFC3473].

   GMPLS security is described in Section 11 of [RFC3471] and refers to
   [RFC3209] for RSVP-TE.  Further details of MPLS-TE and GMPLS security
   can be found in [RFC5920].

9.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains registries and sub-registries for RSVP-TE as used by
   GMPLS.  IANA has made allocations from these registries as set out in
   the following sections.

9.1.  RSVP Objects Class Types

   This document introduces two new Class Types for existing RSVP
   objects.  IANA has made allocations from the "Resource ReSerVation
   Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry using the "Class Names, Class
   Numbers, and Class Types" sub-registry.

   Class Number  Class Name                            Reference

9.2.  Ethernet Switching Granularities

   IANA maintains a registry of GMPLS parameters called "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters".

   IANA has created a new sub-registry called "Ethernet Switching
   Granularities" to contain the values that may be carried in the
   Switching Granularity field of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object.

9.3.  Ethernet Sender TSpec TLVs

   IANA maintains a registry of GMPLS parameters called "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters".

   IANA has created a new sub-registry called "Ethernet Sender TSpec
   TLVs / Ethernet Flowspec TLVs" to contain the TLV type values for
   TLVs carried in the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object.

   Values are as follows:

   0-3          See below.
   4-239        Unassigned
   240-254      Reserved for Vendor-Specific Use

9.4.  Ethernet Bandwidth Profiles

   IANA maintains a registry of GMPLS parameters called "Generalized
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Parameters".

   IANA has created a new sub-registry called "Ethernet Bandwidth
   Profiles" to contain bit flags carried in the Ethernet Bandwidth
   Profile TLV of the Ethernet SENDER_TSPEC object.

   Bits are to be allocated by IETF Standards Action.  Bits are numbered
   from bit 0 as the low order bit.  Initial entries are as follows:

   Bit   Hex   Description                   Reference
   ---   ----  --------------------------    -------------
    0    0x01  Coupling Flag (CF)            [RFC6003]
    1    0x02  Color Mode (CM)               [RFC6003]
