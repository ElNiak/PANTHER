           GMPLS OSPF-TE Extensions in Support of Flexi-Grid
         Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Networks

Abstract

   The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   standardization sector (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations
   G.694.1 and G.872 to include a new Dense Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining channel spacings, a set of
   nominal central frequencies, and the concept of the "frequency slot".
   Corresponding techniques for data-plane connections are known as
   "flexi-grid".

   Based on the characteristics of flexi-grid defined in G.694.1 and in
   RFCs 7698 and 7699, this document describes the Open Shortest Path
   First - Traffic Engineering (OSPF-TE) extensions in support of GMPLS
   control of networks that include devices that use the new flexible
   optical grid.

RFC 8363            GMPLS OSPF-TE for Flexi-Grid DWDM           May 2018


1.  Introduction

   [G.694.1] defines the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)
   frequency grids for Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
   applications.  A frequency grid is a reference set of frequencies
   used to denote allowed nominal central frequencies that may be used
   for defining applications.  The channel spacing is the frequency
   spacing between two allowed nominal central frequencies.  All of the
   wavelengths on a fiber should use different central frequencies and
   occupy a fixed bandwidth of frequency.

   Fixed-grid channel spacing ranges from one of 12.5 GHz, 25 GHz, 50
   GHz, or 100 GHz to integer multiples of 100 GHz.  But [G.694.1] also
   defines a "flexible grid", also known as "flexi-grid".  The terms
   "frequency slot" (i.e., the frequency range allocated to a specific
   channel and unavailable to other channels within a flexible grid) and
   "slot width" (i.e., the full width of a frequency slot in a flexible
   grid) are used to define a flexible grid.

   [RFC7698] defines a framework and the associated control-plane
   requirements for the GMPLS-based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.

   [RFC6163] provides a framework for GMPLS and Path Computation Element
   (PCE) control of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs).
   [RFC7688] defines the requirements and OSPF-TE extensions in support
   of GMPLS control of a WSON.

   [RFC7792] describes requirements and protocol extensions for
   signaling to set up Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in networks that
   support the flexi-grid.  This document complements [RFC7792] by
   describing the requirement and extensions for OSPF-TE routing in a
   flexi-grid network.

   This document complements the efforts to provide extensions to the
   OSPF-TE protocol so as to support GMPLS control of flexi-grid
   networks.

2.  Terminology

   For terminology related to flexi-grid, please consult [RFC7698] and
   [G.694.1].

2.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Requirements for Flexi-Grid Routing

   The architecture for establishing LSPs in a Spectrum Switched Optical
   Network (SSON) is described in [RFC7698].

   A flexi-grid LSP occupies one or multiple specific frequency slots.
   The process of computing a route and the allocation of a frequency
   slot is referred to as "RSA" (Routing and Spectrum Assignment).
   [RFC7698] describes three types of architectural approaches to RSA:
   combined RSA, separated RSA, and routing and distributed SA.  The
   first two approaches could be called "centralized SA" because the
   spectrum (frequency slot) assignment is performed by a single entity
   before the signaling procedure.

   In the case of centralized SA, the assigned frequency slot is
   specified in the RSVP-TE Path message during the signaling process.
   In the case of routing and distributed SA, only the requested slot
   width of the flexi-grid LSP is specified in the Path message,
   allowing the involved network elements to select the frequency slot
   to be used.

   If the capability of switching or converting the whole optical
   spectrum allocated to an optical spectrum LSP is not available at
   nodes along the path of the LSP, the LSP is subject to the Optical
   "Spectrum Continuity Constraint", as described in [RFC7698].

   The remainder of this section states the additional extensions on the
   routing protocols in a flexi-grid network.

3.1.  Available Frequency Ranges

   In the case of flexi-grids, the central frequency steps from 193.1
   THz with 6.25 GHz granularity.  The calculation method of central
   frequency and the frequency slot width of a frequency slot are
   defined in [G.694.1], i.e., by using nominal central frequency n and
   the slot width m.







Zhang, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 8363            GMPLS OSPF-TE for Flexi-Grid DWDM           May 2018


   On a DWDM link, the allocated or in-use frequency slots do not
   overlap with each other.  However, the border frequencies of two
   frequency slots may be the same frequency, i.e., the upper bound of a
   frequency slot and the lower bound of the directly adjacent frequency
   slot are the same.

                         Frequency Slot 1   Frequency Slot 2
                           +-----------+-----------------------+
                           |           |                       |
      -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10  11
   ...+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--...
                           ------------ ------------------------
                                 ^                 ^
                    Central F = 193.1 THz   Central F = 193.1375 THz
                     Slot width = 25 GHz    Slot width = 50 GHz

                  Figure 1: Two Frequency Slots on a Link

   Figure 1 shows two adjacent frequency slots on a link.  The highest
   frequency of frequency slot 1 denoted by n=2 is the lowest frequency
   of slot 2.  In this example, it means that the frequency range from
   n=-2 to n=10 is unavailable to other flexi-grid LSPs.  Available
   central frequencies are advertised for m=1, which means that for an
   available central frequency n, the frequency slot from central
   frequency n-1 to central frequency n+1 is available.

   Hence, in order to clearly show which frequency slots are available
   and can be used for LSP establishment and which frequency slots are
   unavailable, the availability of frequency slots is advertised by the
   routing protocol for the flexi-grid DWDM links.  A set of non-
   overlapping available frequency ranges is disseminated in order to
   allow efficient resource management of flexi-grid DWDM links and RSA
   procedures, which are described in Section 4.8 of [RFC7698].

3.2.  Application Compliance Considerations

   As described in [G.694.1], devices or applications that make use of
   the flexi-grid may not be capable of supporting every possible slot
   width or position (i.e., central frequency).  In other words,
   applications or implementations may be defined where only a subset of
   the possible slot widths and positions are required to be supported.

   For example, an application could be defined where the nominal
   central frequency granularity is 12.5 GHz (by only requiring values
   of n that are even) and the same application only requires slot
   widths as a multiple of 25 GHz (by only requiring values of m that
   are even).




Zhang, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 8363            GMPLS OSPF-TE for Flexi-Grid DWDM           May 2018


   Hence, in order to support all possible applications and
   implementations, the following information SHOULD be advertised for a
   flexi-grid DWDM link:

   o  Channel Spacing (C.S.): as defined in [RFC7699] for flexi-grid, is
      set to 5 to denote 6.25 GHz.

   o  Central frequency granularity: a multiplier of C.S.

   o  Slot width granularity: a multiplier of 2*C.S.

   o  Slot width range: two multipliers of the slot width granularity,
      each indicating the minimal and maximal slot width supported by a
      port, respectively.

   The combination of slot width range and slot width granularity can be
   used to determine the slot widths set supported by a port.

3.3.  Comparison with Fixed-Grid DWDM Links

   In the case of fixed-grid DWDM links, each wavelength has a
   predefined central frequency.  Each wavelength maps to a predefined
   central frequency, and the usable frequency range is implicit by the
   channel spacing.  All the wavelengths on a DWDM link can be
   identified with an identifier that mainly conveys its central
   frequency as the label defined in [RFC6205]; the status of the
   wavelengths (available or not) can be advertised through a routing
   protocol.

   Figure 2 shows a link that supports a fixed-grid with 50 GHz channel
   spacing.  The central frequencies of the wavelengths are predefined
   by values of "n", and each wavelength occupies a fixed 50 GHz
   frequency range as described in [G.694.1].

        W(-2)  |    W(-1)  |    W(0)   |    W(1)   |     W(2)  |
   ...---------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----...
         |   50 GHz  |  50 GHz   |  50 GHz   |   50 GHz  |

       n=-2        n=-1        n=0         n=1         n=2
   ...---+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+----------...
                                 ^
                    Central F = 193.1 THz

                Figure 2: A Link Supports Fixed Wavelengths
                        with 50 GHz Channel Spacing

RFC 8363            GMPLS OSPF-TE for Flexi-Grid DWDM           May 2018


   Unlike the fixed-grid DWDM links, on a flexi-grid DWDM link, the slot
   width of the frequency slot is flexible, as described in Section 3.1.
   That is, the value of m in the following formula from [G.694.1] is
   uncertain before a frequency slot is actually allocated for a flexi-
   grid LSP.

                Slot Width (in GHz) = 12.5GHz * m

   For this reason, the available frequency slots (or ranges) are
   advertised for a flexi-grid DWDM link instead of the specific
   "wavelength" points that are sufficient for a fixed-grid link.
   Moreover, this advertisement is represented by the combination of
   central frequency granularity and slot width granularity.

4.  Extensions

   The network-connectivity topology constructed by the links and/or
   nodes and node capabilities are the same as for WSON, as described in
   [RFC7698], and they can be advertised by the GMPLS routing protocols
   using Opaque Link State Advertisements (LSAs) [RFC3630] in the case
   of OSPF-TE [RFC4203] (refer to Section 6.2 of [RFC6163]).  In the
   flexi-grid case, the available frequency ranges, instead of the
   specific "wavelengths", are advertised for the link.  This section
   defines the GMPLS OSPF-TE extensions in support of advertising the
   available frequency ranges for flexi-grid DWDM links.

4.1.  Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD) Extensions for
      Flexi-Grid

   This section defines a new value for the Switching Capability field
   of the ISCD with a value of 152 and type name Flexi-Grid-LSC.

            Value              Name
            -----              --------------
            152                Flexi-Grid-LSC

   Switching Capability and Encoding values MUST be used as follows:

            Switching Capability = Flexi-Grid-LSC

            Encoding Type = lambda (as defined in [RFC3471])

   When the Switching Capability and Encoding fields are set to values
   as stated above, the ISCD is interpreted as in [RFC4203] with the
   optional inclusion of one or more Switching Capability Specific
   Information (SCSI) sub-TLVs.





Zhang, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 8363            GMPLS OSPF-TE for Flexi-Grid DWDM           May 2018


   As the "Max LSP Bandwidth at priority x" (x from 0 to 7) fields in
   the generic part of the ISCD [RFC4203] are not meaningful for flexi-
   grid DWDM links, the values of these fields MUST be set to zero and
   MUST be ignored.  The SCSI as defined below provides the
   corresponding information for flexi-grid DWDM links.

4.1.1.  Switching Capability Specific Information (SCSI)

   [RFC8258] defines a Generalized SCSI for the ISCD.  This document
   defines the Frequency Availability Bitmap as a new type of the
   Generalized SCSI TLV.  The technology-specific part of the flexi-grid
   ISCD includes the available frequency-spectrum resource as well as
   the information regarding max slot widths per priority.  The format
   of this flexi-grid SCSI, the Frequency Availability Bitmap sub-TLV,
   is depicted in the following figure:

     0                   1                   2                   3

   Type (16 bits): The type of this sub-TLV (11).

   Length (16 bits): The length of the value field of this sub-TLV in
   octets.

   Priority (8 bits): A bitmap used to indicate which priorities are
   being advertised.  The bitmap is in ascending order, with the
   leftmost bit representing priority level 0 (i.e., the highest) and
   the rightmost bit representing priority level 7 (i.e., the lowest).
   A bit is set (1) corresponding to each priority represented in the
   sub-TLV and clear (0) for each priority not represented in the sub-
   TLV.  At least one priority level MUST be advertised.  If only one
   priority level is advertised, it MUST be at priority level 0.

   Reserved: The Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission and
   MUST be ignored on receipt.

RFC 8363            GMPLS OSPF-TE for Flexi-Grid DWDM           May 2018


   Max Slot Width at Priority k (16 bits): This field indicates maximal
   frequency slot width supported at a particular priority level, up to
   8.  This field is set to max frequency slot width supported in the
   unit of 2*C.S., for a particular priority level.  One field MUST be
   present for each bit set in the Priority field, and each present
   field is ordered to match the Priority field.  Fields MUST be present
   for priority levels that are indicated in the Priority field.

   Unreserved Padding (16 bits): The Padding field is used to ensure the
   32-bit alignment of Max Slot Width at Priority k.  When k is an odd
   number, the Unreserved Padding field MUST be included.  When k is an
   even number, the Unreserved Padding field MUST be omitted.  This
   field MUST be set to 0 and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   C.S. (4 bits): As defined in [RFC7699]; it is currently set to 5.

   Starting n (16 bits): As defined in [RFC7699].  This value denotes
   the starting point of the nominal central frequency of the frequency
   availability bitmap sub-TLV.

   No. of Effective Bits (12 bits): Indicates the number of effective
   bits in the Bitmap field.

   Bitmap (variable): Indicates whether or not a basic frequency slot,
   characterized by a nominal central frequency and a fixed m value of
   1, is available for flexi-grid LSP setup.  The first nominal central
   frequency is the value of starting n; subsequent nominal central
   frequencies are implied by the position in the bitmap.  Note that
   setting to 1 indicates that the corresponding central frequency is
   available for a flexi-grid LSP with m=1 and setting to 0 indicates
   the corresponding central frequency is unavailable.  Note that a
   centralized SA process will need to extend this to high values of m
   by checking a sufficiently large number of consecutive basic
   frequency slots that are available.

   padding bits (variable): Padded after the Bitmap to make it a
   multiple of four bytes, if necessary.  Padding bits MUST be set to 0
   and MUST be ignored on receipt.

   An example is provided in Section 4.1.2.

                  Figure 3: Flexi-Grid DWDM Link Example

   The symbol "+" represents the allowed nominal central frequency.  The
   symbol "--" represents a central frequency granularity of 6.25 GHz,
   which is currently standardized in [G.694.1].  The number on the top
   of the line represents the "n" in the frequency calculation formula
   (193.1 + n * 0.00625).  The nominal central frequency is 193.1 THz
   when n equals zero.

   In this example, it is assumed that the lowest nominal central
   frequency supported is n=-9 and the highest is n=11.  Note they
   cannot be used as a nominal central frequency for setting up an LSP,
   but merely as the way to express the supported frequency range.
   Using the encoding defined in Section 4.1.1, the relevant fields to
   express the frequency resource availability can be filled as below:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   In the above example, the starting n is selected to be the lowest
   nominal central frequency, i.e., -9.  It is observed from the bitmap
   that n=-1 to 7 can be used to set up LSPs.  Note other starting n
   values can be chosen to represent the bitmap; for example, the first
   available nominal central frequency (a.k.a., the first available
   basic frequency slot) can be chosen, and the SCSI will be expressed
   as the following:

   This encoding denotes that, other than the advertised available
   nominal central frequencies, the other nominal central frequencies
   within the whole frequency range supported by the link are not
   available for flexi-grid LSP setup.

   If an LSP with slot width m equal to 1 is set up using this link, say
   using n=-1, then the SCSI information is updated to be the following:

4.2.  Extensions to the Port Label Restrictions Field

   As described in Section 3.2, a port that supports flexi-grid may
   support only a restricted subset of the full flexible grid.  The Port
   Label Restrictions field is defined in [RFC7579].  It can be used to
   describe the label restrictions on a port and is carried in the top-
   level Link TLV as specified in [RFC7580].  A new restriction type,
   the flexi-grid Restriction Type, is defined here to specify the
   restrictions on a port to support flexi-grid.

   described in Section 4.1.

   Encoding (8 bits): As defined in [RFC7579], MUST be consistent with
   the one specified in ISCD as described in Section 4.1.

   C.S. (4 bits): As defined in [RFC7699].  For flexi-grid, it is 5 to
   denote 6.25 GHz.

   C.F.G (Central Frequency Granularity, 8 bits): A positive integer.
   Its value indicates the multiple of C.S., in terms of central
   frequency granularity.

   S.W.G (Slot Width Granularity, 8 bits): A positive integer.  Its
   value indicates the multiple of 2*C.S., in terms of slot width
   granularity.

   Min Slot Width (16 bits): A positive integer.  Its value indicates
   the multiple of 2*C.S. (in GHz), in terms of the supported minimal
   slot width.

   Reserved: The Reserved field MUST be set to zero on transmission and
   SHOULD be ignored on receipt.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  New ISCD Switching Type

   IANA has made the following assignment in the "Switching Types" sub-
   registry of the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   Signaling Parameters" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters>:

         Value      Name                Reference
         -------    ----------------    ----------
         152        Flexi-Grid-LSC      RFC 8363

5.2.  New SCSI Type

   This document defines a new generalized SCSI sub-TLV that is carried
   in the Interface Switching Capability Descriptors [RFC4203] when the
   Switching Type is set to Flexi-Grid-LSC.

   IANA has made the following assignment in the "Generalized SCSI
   (Switching Capability Specific Information) TLV Types" sub-registry
   [RFC8258] of the "Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS)
   Signaling Parameters" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/gmpls-sig-parameters>:

   Value  SCSI-TLV                        Switching Type   Reference
   -----  -----------------------------   --------------   ---------
    11    Frequency Availability Bitmap   152              RFC 8363

6.  Security Considerations

   This document extends [RFC4203] and [RFC7580] to carry flexi-grid-
   specific information in OSPF Opaque LSAs.  This document does not
   introduce any further security issues other than those discussed in
   [RFC3630] and [RFC4203].  To be more specific, the security
   mechanisms described in [RFC2328], which apply to Opaque LSAs carried
   in OSPF, still apply.  An analysis of the OSPF security is provided
   in [RFC6863] and applies to the extensions to OSPF in this document
   as well.
