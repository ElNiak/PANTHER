                            ASSIGNED NUMBERS




This Network Working Group Request for Comments documents the currently
assigned values from several series of numbers used in network protocol
implementations.  This RFC will be updated periodically, and in any case
current information can be obtained from Jon Postel. The assignment of
numbers is also handled by Jon.  If you are developing a protocol or
application that will require the use of a link, socket, etc. please
contact Jon to receive a number assignment.

Most of the protocols mentioned here are documented in the RFC series of
notes. The more prominent and more generally used are documented in the
Protocol Handbook [1] prepared by the Network Information Center (NIC).
In the lists that follow a bracketed number, e.g. [1], off to the right
of the page indicates a reference for the listed protocol.

Assigned Link Numbers



                         ASSIGNED LINK NUMBERS

   The word "link" here refers to a field in the original ARPANET
   Host/IMP interface leader.  The link was originally defined as an 8
   bit field.  Some time after the ARPANET Host-to-Host (AHHP) protocol
   was defined and, by now, some time ago the definition of this field
   was changed to "Message-ID" and the length to 12 bits. The name link
   now refers to the high order 8 bits of this 12 bit message-id field.
   The low order 4 bits of the message-id field are to be zero unless
   specifically specified otherwise for the particular protocol used on
   that link.  The Host/IMP interface is defined in BBN report 1822 [2].

                        ASSIGNED SOCKET NUMBERS

   Sockets are used in the AHHP [1,3] to name the ends of logical
   connections which carry long term conversations.  For the purpose of
   providing services to all callers an Initial Connection Procedure ICP
   [1,34] is used between the user process and the server process.  This
   list specifies the socket used by the server process as its contact
   socket.
