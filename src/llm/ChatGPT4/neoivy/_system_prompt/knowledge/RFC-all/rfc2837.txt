1. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC
      1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574
      [12].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [13].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

2. Overview

   A Fibre Channel Fabric is an entity which interconnects Node Ports
   (N_Ports) or Node Loop Ports (NL_Ports).  It provides transport and
   routing functions.  In essence, a Fabric is a network of N_Ports
   and/or NL_Ports to communicate with one another.  A Fabric is
   composed of one or more Fabric Element that are interconnected via
   Inter-element Links (IEL).  A Fabric Element is the smallest unit of
   a Fabric that meets the definition of a Fabric.  It must consist of
   at least three external ports to connect to either N_Ports, NL_Ports
   or other Fabric Elements.  In general, a Fabric Element port may be
   of one of the following types:

   (1) F_Port, a fabric port to connect to an N_Port ([17], [21], [22]);

   (2)  FL_Port, a fabric port that also supports a FC Arbitrated Loop
       consisting of one or more NL_Ports ([20], [24]).

   (3)  E_Port, an expansion port to connect to another Fabric Element
       ([18], [23]);

   This memo shall define objects related to a Fabric Element, its
   F_Ports and FL_Ports.  Objects related to other types of FC ports
   shall be defined in future.

   For the rest of the document, the term, "FxPort", will be used to
   refer to both F_Port and FL_Port where the distinction is not
   necessary.  The term, "NxPort" will be used to refer to both N_Port
   and NL_Port in the similar fashion.

2.1. Management View of a Fabric Element

   From the management perspective, it is helpful to view a Fabric
   Element to be consisting of multiple "modules".  Each module is a
   grouping, either physical or logical, of one or more ports that may
   be managed as a sub-entity within the Fabric Element.

   This module mapping is recommended but optional.  A vendor may elect
   to put all ports into a single module, or to divide the ports into
   modules that do not match physical divisions.

   The object fcFeModuleCapacity indicates the maximum number of modules
   that a given Fabric Element may contain.  This value must remain
   constant from one management restart to the next.

   Each module is uniquely identified by a module number in the range of
   1 through fcFeModuleCapacity inclusive.  Modules may come and go
   without causing a management reset (of sysUpTime), and may be
   sparsely numbered within the Fabric Element.  That is, the module
   numbering is not required to be contiguous.  For instance, if a
   module is mapped physically to a field-replaceable card and in a 13-
   card cage Fabric Element, cards 3, 5, 6 and 7 may be installed.  The
   vendor may choose to label them as modules 3, 5, 6 and 7
   respectively.  In this example, the value of fcFeModuleCapacity is
   13.  Note that the object fcFeModuleLastChange acts as the
   discontinuity indicator for all counter objects in this MIB.

   A Fabric Element may also provide a proxy management on behalf of
   another management entity by presenting it as one of its Fabric
   Element modules.

   The object fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity indicates the maximum number of
   ports that a given module may contain.  The value of
   fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity must not change for a given module.
   However, a module may be deleted from the Fabric Element and replaced
   with a module containing a different number of ports.  The value of
   fcFeModuleLastChange will indicate that a change took place.

   Each port within the Fabric Element is uniquely identified by a
   combination of module index and port index, where port index is an
   integer in the range (1..fcFeModuleFxPortCapacity).  As with modules
   within a Fabric Element, ports within a module may be sparsely
   numbered.  That is the port numbering is not required to be
   contiguous.  Likewise, ports may come and go within a module without
   causing a management reset.

   In terms of attachment, an F_Port will be attached to another N_Port;
   and an FL_Port will be attached to one or up to 126 NL_Ports.  In
   general, an FxPort may be attached to one or more NxPorts.  Each
   NxPort associated with an FxPort will be uniquely identified by a
   combination of module index, FxPort index and NxPort index.  An
   NxPort index is an integer in the range (1..126).  The following
   diagram illustrates the management view of a Fabric Element.

           #=====================================|=================#
                                                 |
        One or more NxPorts   { [1] . . . [L] }<-+
                              - - - - - - - - -
   where "i", "n", "M" and "L" are some arbitrary sample integer values,
   and "L" must be less than 127.

2.2. Structure of the Fabric Element MIB

   This memo assumes that a Fabric Element has an SNMP entity associated
   with its managed objects.  The managed objects are divided as follow:

         - the Configuration group
         - the Status group
         - the Error group
         - the Accounting group
         - the Capability group

   In each group, scalar objects and table entries are defined.

   The Configuration group contains configuration and service parameters
   for the Fabric Element, modules and the FxPorts.

   The Operation group contains the operational status and parameters of
   an FxPort.  The group also contains the service parameters that have
   been established between the FxPort and its attached NxPort, if
   applicable.

   The Error group contains counters tracking various types of errors
   detected by each FxPort.  The information may be used for diagnostics
   and/or to derive the quality of the link between an FxPort and one or
   more attached NxPorts.

RFC 2837                 FC Fabric Element MIB                  May 2000


   The Accounting group contains statistic data suitable for deriving
   accounting and performance information.

   The Capability group contains parameters indicating the inherent
   capability of the Fabric Element and each FxPort.

4. Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/delete) them.
