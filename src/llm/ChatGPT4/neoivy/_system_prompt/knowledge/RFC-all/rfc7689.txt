     Signaling Extensions for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks

Abstract

   This document provides extensions to Generalized Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of Wavelength Switched
   Optical Networks (WSONs).  Such extensions are applicable in WSONs
   under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional processing,
   such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at specific nodes
   along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured to accept an
   optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where equipment must
   be configured to output an optical signal with specific attributes.
   This document provides mechanisms to support distributed wavelength
   assignment with a choice of distributed wavelength assignment
   algorithms.

1.  Introduction

   This document provides extensions to Generalized Multiprotocol Label
   Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of Wavelength Switched
   Optical Networks (WSONs).  Fundamental extensions are given to permit
   simultaneous bidirectional wavelength assignment, while more advanced
   extensions are given to support the networks described in [RFC6163],
   which feature connections requiring configuration of input, output,
   and general signal processing capabilities at a node along a Label
   Switched Path (LSP).

   These extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda and
   G.709-based networks.

   Related documents are [RFC7446] that provides a high-level
   information model and [RFC7581] that provides common encodings that
   can be applicable to other protocol extensions such as routing.

2.  Terminology

   CWDM: Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing.

   DWDM: Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing.

   ROADM: Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer.  A reduced port
      count wavelength selective switching element featuring ingress and
      egress line side ports as well as add/drop side ports.

   RWA: Routing and Wavelength Assignment.

   Wavelength Conversion/Converters: The process of converting
      information bearing optical signal centered at a given frequency
      (wavelength) to one with "equivalent" content centered at a
      different wavelength.  Wavelength conversion can be implemented
      via an optical-electronic-optical (OEO) process or via a strictly
      optical process.

   WDM: Wavelength Division Multiplexing.

   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSONs): WDM-based optical
      networks in which switching is performed selectively based on the
      frequency of an optical signal.

   AWG: Arrayed Waveguide Grating.

   OXC: Optical Cross-Connect.

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   Optical Transmitter: A device that has both a laser, tuned on a
      certain wavelength, and electronic components that convert
      electronic signals into optical signals.

   Optical Receiver: A device that has both optical and electronic
      components.  It detects optical signals and converts optical
      signals into electronic signals.

   Optical Transponder: A device that has both an optical transmitter
      and an optical receiver.

   Optical End Node: The end of a wavelength (optical lambdas) lightpath
      in the data plane.  It may be equipped with some
      optical/electronic devices such as wavelength
      multiplexers/demultiplexer (e.g., AWG), optical transponder, etc.,
      which are employed to transmit/terminate the optical signals for
      data transmission.

   FEC: Forward Error Correction.  FEC is a digital signal processing
      technique used to enhance data reliability.  It does this by
      introducing redundant data, called error correcting code, prior to
      data transmission or storage.  FEC provides the receiver with the
      ability to correct errors without a reverse channel to request the
      retransmission of data.

   3R Regeneration: The process of amplifying (correcting loss),
      reshaping (correcting noise and dispersion), retiming
      (synchronizing with the network clock), and retransmitting an
      optical signal.

2.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Requirements for WSON Signaling

   The following requirements for GMPLS-based WSON signaling are in
   addition to the functionality already provided by existing GMPLS
   signaling mechanisms.

3.1.  WSON Signal Characterization

   WSON signaling needs to convey sufficient information characterizing
   the signal to allow systems along the path to determine compatibility
   and perform any required local configuration.  Examples of such
   systems include intermediate nodes (ROADMs, OXCs, wavelength



Bernstein, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   converters, regenerators, OEO switches, etc.), links (WDM systems),
   and end systems (detectors, demodulators, etc.).  The details of any
   local configuration processes are outside the scope of this document.

   From [RFC6163], we have the following list of WSON signal
   characteristics:

   1.  Optical tributary signal class (modulation format).
   2.  FEC: whether forward error correction is used in the digital
      stream and what type of error correcting code is used
   3.  Center frequency (wavelength)
   4.  Bit rate
   5.  G-PID: General Protocol Identifier for the information format

   The first three items on this list can change as a WSON signal
   traverses a network with regenerators, OEO switches, or wavelength
   converters.  These parameters are summarized in the Optical Interface
   Class as defined in [RFC7446], and the assumption is that a class
   always includes signal compatibility information.  An ability to
   control wavelength conversion already exists in GMPLS signaling along
   with the ability to share client signal type information (G-PID).  In
   addition, bit rate is a standard GMPLS signaling traffic parameter.
   It is referred to as bandwidth encoding in [RFC3471].

3.2.  Per-Node Processing Configuration

   In addition to configuring a node along an LSP to input or output a
   signal with specific attributes, we may need to signal the node to
   perform specific processing, such as 3R regeneration, on the signal
   at a particular node.  [RFC6163] discussed three types of processing:

      (A) Regeneration (possibly different types)

      (B) Fault and Performance Monitoring

      (C) Attribute Conversion

   The extensions here provide for the configuration of these types of
   processing at nodes along an LSP.

3.3.  Bidirectional WSON LSPs

   WSON signaling can support LSP setup consistent with the wavelength
   continuity constraint for bidirectional connections.  The following
   cases need to be supported separately:

   (a)  Where the same wavelength is used for both upstream and
        downstream directions



Bernstein, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   (b)  Where different wavelengths are used for both upstream and
        downstream directions.

   This document will review existing GMPLS bidirectional solutions
   according to WSON case.

3.4.  Distributed Wavelength Assignment Selection Method

   WSON signaling can support the selection of a specific distributed
   wavelength assignment method.

   This method is beneficial in cases of equipment failure, etc., where
   fast provisioning used in quick recovery is critical to protect
   carriers/users against system loss.  This requires efficient
   signaling that supports distributed wavelength assignment, in
   particular, when the wavelength assignment capability is not
   available.

   As discussed in [RFC6163], different computational approaches for
   wavelength assignment are available.  One method is the use of
   distributed wavelength assignment.  This feature would allow the
   specification of a particular approach when more than one is
   implemented in the systems along the path.

3.5.  Optical Impairments

   This document does not address signaling information related to
   optical impairments.

4.  WSON Signal Traffic Parameters, Attributes, and Processing

   As discussed in [RFC6163], single-channel optical signals used in
   WSONs are called "optical tributary signals" and come in a number of
   classes characterized by modulation format and bit rate.  Although
   WSONs are fairly transparent to the signals they carry, to ensure
   compatibility amongst various networks devices and end systems, it
   can be important to include key lightpath characteristics as traffic
   parameters in signaling [RFC6163].

   LSPs signaled through extensions provided in this document MUST apply
   the following signaling parameters:

      o  Switching Capability = WSON-LSC [RFC7688]
      o  Encoding Type = Lambda [RFC3471]
      o  Label Format = as defined in [RFC6205]

   [RFC6205] defines the label format as applicable to LSC capable
   devices.

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


4.1.  Traffic Parameters for Optical Tributary Signals

   In [RFC3471] we see that the G-PID (client signal type) and bit rate
   (byte rate) of the signals are defined as parameters, and in
   [RFC3473] they are conveyed in the Generalized Label Request object
   and the RSVP SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC objects, respectively.

4.2.  WSON Processing Hop Attribute TLV

   Section 3.1 provides requirements to signal to a node along an LSP
   what type of processing to perform on an optical signal and how to
   configure itself to accept or transmit an optical signal with
   particular attributes.

   To target a specific node, this section defines a WSON Processing Hop
   Attribute TLV.  This TLV is encoded as an attributes TLV; see
   [RFC5420].  The TLV is carried in the ERO and RRO Hop Attributes
   subobjects and processed according to the procedures defined in
   [RFC7570].  The type value of the WSON Processing Hop Attribute TLV
   is 4 as assigned by IANA.

   The WSON Processing Hop Attribute TLV carries one or more sub-TLVs
   with the following format:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |     Type      |   Length      |                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               |
   //                            Value                            //
   |                               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |           ...                 |        Padding                |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Type

      The identifier of the sub-TLV.

   Length

      Indicates the total length of the sub-TLV in octets.  That is, the
      combined length of the Type, Length, and Value fields, i.e., two
      plus the length of the Value field in octets.

   Value

      Zero or more octets of data carried in the sub-TLV.




Bernstein, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   Padding

      Variable

   The entire sub-TLV MUST be padded with zeros to ensure four-octet
   alignment of the sub-TLV.

   Sub-TLV ordering is significant and MUST be preserved.  Error
   processing follows [RFC7570].

   The following sub-TLV types are defined in this document:

   Sub-TLV Name        Type    Length
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   ResourceBlockInfo    1      variable
   WavelengthSelection  2      8 octets (2-octet padding)

   The TLV can be represented in Reduced Backus-Naur Form (RBNF)
   [RFC5511] syntax as:

   <WSON Processing Hop Attribute> ::= <ResourceBlockInfo>
   [<ResourceBlockInfo>] [<WavelengthSelection>]

4.2.1.  ResourceBlockInfo Sub-TLV

   The format of the ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLV value field is defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC7581].  It is a list of available Optical Interface
   Classes and processing capabilities.

   At least one ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLV MUST be present in the WSON
   Processing Hop Attribute TLV.  No more than two ResourceBlockInfo
   sub-TLVs SHOULD be present.  Any present ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLVs
   MUST be processed in the order received, and extra (unprocessed) sub-
   TLVs SHOULD be ignored.

   The ResourceBlockInfo field contains several information elements as
   defined by [RFC7581].  The following rules apply to the sub-TLV:

   o  RB Set field can carry one or more RB Identifier.  Only the first
      RB Identifier listed in the RB Set field SHALL be processed; any
      others SHOULD be ignored.

   o  In the case of unidirectional LSPs, only one ResourceBlockInfo
      sub-TLV SHALL be processed, and the I and O bits can be safely
      ignored.






Bernstein, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 8]

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   o  In the case of a bidirectional LSP, there MUST be either:

      (a) only one ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLV present in a WSON
          Processing Hop Attribute TLV, and the bits I and O both set to
          1, or

      (b) two ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLVs present, one with only the I
          bit set and the other with only the O bit set.

   o  The rest of the information carried within the ResourceBlockInfo
      sub-TLV includes the Optical Interface Class List, Input Bit Rate
      List, and Processing Capability List.  These lists MAY contain one
      or more elements.  These elements apply equally to both
      bidirectional and unidirectional LSPs.

   Any violation of these rules detected by a transit or egress node
   SHALL be treated as an error and be processed per [RFC7570].

   A ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLV can be constructed by a node and added to
   an ERO Hop Attributes subobject in order to be processed by
   downstream nodes (transit and egress).  As defined in [RFC7570], the
   R bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE semantic
   defined in [RFC5420], and it SHOULD be set accordingly.

   Once a node properly parses a ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLV received in
   an ERO Hop Attributes subobject (according to the rules stated above
   and in [RFC7570]), the node allocates the indicated resources, e.g.,
   the selected regeneration pool, for the LSP.  In addition, the node
   SHOULD report compliance by adding an RRO Hop Attributes subobject
   with the WSON Processing Hop Attribute TLV (and its sub-TLVs)
   indicating the utilized resources.  ResourceBlockInfo sub-TLVs
   carried in an RRO Hop Attributes subobject are subject to [RFC7570]
   and standard RRO processing; see [RFC3209].

4.2.2.  WavelengthSelection Sub-TLV

   Routing + Distributed Wavelength Assignment (R+DWA) is one of the
   options defined by [RFC6163].  The output from the routing function
   will be a path, but the wavelength will be selected on a hop-by-hop
   basis.

   As discussed in [RFC6163], the wavelength assignment can be either
   for a unidirectional lightpath or for a bidirectional lightpath
   constrained to use the same lambda in both directions.

   In order to indicate wavelength assignment directionality and
   wavelength assignment method, the WavelengthSelection sub-TLV is
   carried in the WSON Processing Hop Attribute TLV defined above.



Bernstein, et al.            Standards Track                    [Page 9]

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   The WavelengthSelection sub-TLV value field is defined as:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |W|  WA Method  |                    Reserved                   |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

   W (1 bit): 0 denotes requiring the same wavelength in both
      directions; 1 denotes that different wavelengths on both
      directions are allowed.

      Wavelength Assignment (WA) Method (7 bits):

      0: unspecified (any); This does not constrain the WA method used
          by a specific node.  This value is implied when the
          WavelengthSelection sub-TLV is absent.

      1: First-Fit.  All the wavelengths are numbered, and this WA
          method chooses the available wavelength with the lowest index.

      2: Random.  This WA method chooses an available wavelength
          randomly.

      3: Least-Loaded (multi-fiber).  This WA method selects the
          wavelength that has the largest residual capacity on the most
          loaded link along the route.  This method is used in multi-
          fiber networks.  If used in single-fiber networks, it is
          equivalent to the First-Fit WA method.

      4-127: Unassigned.

   The processing rules for this TLV are as follows:

   If a receiving node does not support the attribute(s), its behaviors
   are specified below:

   -  W bit not supported: a PathErr MUST be generated with the Error
      Code "Routing Problem" (24) with error sub-code "Unsupported
      WavelengthSelection Symmetry value" (107).

   -  WA method not supported: a PathErr MUST be generated with the
      Error Code "Routing Problem" (24) with error sub-code "Unsupported
      Wavelength Assignment value" (108).

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   A WavelengthSelection sub-TLV can be constructed by a node and added
   to an ERO Hop Attributes subobject in order to be processed by
   downstream nodes (transit and egress).  As defined in [RFC7570], the
   R bit reflects the LSP_REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTE and LSP_ATTRIBUTE semantic
   defined in [RFC5420], and it SHOULD be set accordingly.

   Once a node properly parses the WavelengthSelection sub-TLV received
   in an ERO Hop Attributes subobject, the node use the indicated
   wavelength assignment method (at that hop) for the LSP.  In addition,
   the node SHOULD report compliance by adding an RRO Hop Attributes
   subobject with the WSON Processing Hop Attribute TLV (and its sub-
   TLVs) that indicate the utilized method.  WavelengthSelection sub-
   TLVs carried in an RRO Hop Attributes subobject are subject to
   [RFC7570] and standard RRO processing; see [RFC3209].

5.  Security Considerations

   This document is built on the mechanisms defined in [RFC3473], and
   only differs in the specific information communicated.  The specific
   additional information (optical resource and wavelength selection
   properties) is not viewed as substantively changing or adding to the
   security considerations of the existing GMPLS signaling protocol
   mechanisms.  See [RFC3473] for details of the supported security
   measures.  Additionally, [RFC5920] provides an overview of security
   vulnerabilities and protection mechanisms for the GMPLS control
   plane.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a new value in the existing "Attributes TLV Space"
   registry located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-te-parameters>, as updated by
   [RFC7570]:

RFC 7689                WSON Signaling Extensions          November 2015


   IANA has created a new registry named "Sub-TLV Types for WSON
   Processing Hop Attribute TLV" located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-te-parameters>.

   The following entries have been added:

   Value            Sub-TLV Type            Reference

   0                Reserved                RFC 7689

   1                ResourceBlockInfo       RFC 7689

   2                WavelengthSelection     RFC 7689

   All assignments are to be performed via Standards Action or
   Specification Required policies as defined in [RFC5226].

   IANA has created a new registry named "Values for Wavelength
   Assignment Method field in WavelengthSelection Sub-TLV" located at
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/rsvp-te-parameters>.

   The following entries have been added:

   Value          Meaning                    Reference


   0             unspecified                RFC 7689

   3             Least-Loaded (multi-fiber) RFC 7689

   4-127         Unassigned

   All assignments are to be performed via Standards Action or
   Specification Required policies as defined in [RFC5226].  The
   assignment policy chosen for any specific code point must be clearly
   stated in the document that describes the code point so that IANA can
   apply the correct policy.
