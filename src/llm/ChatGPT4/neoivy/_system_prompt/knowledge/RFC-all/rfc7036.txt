1.  Introduction

   When the Long-Term Archive and Notary Services (LTANS) working group
   was chartered, an object identifier arc was set aside for use by that
   working group.  These object identifiers are primarily used with
   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [ASN1-88] [ASN1-97].

   The LTANS object identifier arc is:

      id-ltans OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-organization(3)
                                       dod(6) internet(1) security(5)
                                       mechanisms(5) ltans(11) }

   This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned,
   and it establishes IANA allocation policies for any future
   assignments within that arc.

2.  Subordinate Object Identifier Arcs

   Three subordinate object identifier arcs were used.  The first arc,
   id-mod, was used to assign ASN.1 module identifiers.  The second arc,
   id-ct, was used to assign Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) content
   types.  The third arc, id-em, was set aside for Evidence Record
   Syntax (ERS) encryption methods.

      id-mod  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ltans 0 }
      id-ct   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ltans 1 }
      id-em   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ltans 2 }

3.  Module Identifiers

   The Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) [RFC4998] includes two ASN.1
   modules.  Both modules define the same syntax, but one module uses
   the 1997 ASN.1 syntax, and the other module uses the 1988 ASN.1
   syntax.  These module identifiers are:

      id-mod-ers           OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 1 }
      id-mod-ers-v1        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 1 1 }
      id-mod-ers88         OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 2 }
      id-mod-ers88-v1      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 2 1 }

   The Long-term Archive Protocol (LTAP) [LTAP] includes two ASN.1
   modules.  While this protocol was never published as an RFC, the
   module identifiers were assigned to facilitate implementation.  Both
   modules define the same syntax, but one module uses the 1997 ASN.1
   syntax, and the other module uses the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.  These
   module identifiers are:

      id-mod-ltap88        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 3 }
      id-mod-ltap88-v0     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 3 0 }
      id-mod-ltap88-v1     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 3 1 }
      id-mod-ltap          OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 4 }
      id-mod-ltap-v0       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 4 0 }
      id-mod-ltap-v1       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 4 1 }

   The document that describes the conventions for using the Server-
   Based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP) to convey Long-Term
   Evidence Records [RFC5276] includes one ASN.1 module.  The module
   identifier is:

      id-mod-ers-scvp      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 5 }
      id-mod-ers-scvp-v1   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 5 1 }

   The Data Structure for the Security Suitability of Cryptographic
   Algorithms (DSSC) [RFC5698] includes two ASN.1 modules.  Both modules
   define the same syntax, but one module uses the 1997 ASN.1 syntax,
   and the other module uses the 1988 ASN.1 syntax.  These module
   identifiers are:

      id-mod-dssc88        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 6 }
      id-mod-dssc88-v1     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 6 1 }
      id-mod-dssc          OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 7 }
      id-mod-dssc-v1       OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-mod 7 1 }

4.  CMS Content Types

   A CMS content type for an Evidence Record was reserved, but no
   specification points to this value.  It remains reserved.

      id-ct-evidence-record  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 1 }

   The Data Structure for the Security Suitability of Cryptographic
   Algorithms (DSSC) [RFC5698] specifies three CMS content types.  These
   CMS content types are:

      id-ct-dssc-asn1        OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 2 }
      id-ct-dssc-xml         OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 3 }
      id-ct-dssc-tbsPolicy   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 6 }

   The Long-term Archive Protocol (LTAP) [LTAP] defines two CMS content
   types.  While this protocol was never published as an RFC, the CMS
   content types were assigned to facilitate implementation.  These CMS
   content types are:

      id-ct-LTAPRequest      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 4 }
      id-ct-LTAPResponse     OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ct 5 }

5.  ERS Encryption Methods

   An arc was set up for Evidence Record Syntax (ERS) encryption
   methods, and one object identifier was assigned.  However, that
   object identifier is obsolete, and it should not be used.

      id-em-enveloped-data OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-em 1 } -- obsolete

6.  Security Considerations

   This document populates an IANA registry, and it raises no new
   security considerations.  The protocols that specify these values
   include the security considerations associated with their usage.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated one registry table and created four additional
   tables.

   Updates to the four new tables require Expert Review, as defined in
   [RFC5226].  The Designated Expert is expected to ensure that any new
   values are strongly related to the work that was done by the LTANS
   WG.  Object identifiers for other purposes should not be assigned in
   this arc.
