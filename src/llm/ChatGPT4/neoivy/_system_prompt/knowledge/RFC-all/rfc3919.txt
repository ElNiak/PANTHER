   Remote Network Monitoring (RMON) Protocol Identifiers for IPv6 and
                 Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  It does
   not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of this
   memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This memo defines additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol
   identifier examples for IP version 6 and MPLS protocols.  These can
   be used to produce valid protocolDirTable INDEX encodings, as defined
   by the Remote Network Monitoring MIB (Management Information Base)
   Version 2 [RFC2021] and the RMON Protocol Identifier Reference
   [RFC2895].

   This document contains additional (to those in RFC 2896) protocol
   identifier macros for well-known protocols.  A conformant
   implementation of the RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] can be accomplished
   without the use of these protocol identifiers, and accordingly, this
   document does not specify any IETF standard.  It is published to
   encourage better interoperability between RMON-2 agent
   implementations, by providing RMON related IPv6 and MPLS protocol
   information.

1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual
   information store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB
   objects are generally accessed through the Simple Network Management
   Protocol (SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
   defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is
   described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579]
   and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This memo defines basic protocol identifiers for IP version 6 and
   MPLS protocols.

   The "Remote Network Monitoring MIB Protocol Identifier Macros"
   [RFC2896], defines various protocol identifiers.  The syntax of the
   protocol identifier descriptor is defined in the RMON Protocol
   Identifier Reference [RFC2895].  The reader should be familiar with
   these documents.

   The intent of this document is not to adapt each protocol identifier
   defined in the RFC 2895 and in the RFC 2896 to IP version 6, but to
   define protocol identifiers for IP version 6 protocols and for MPLS
   protocol.

3.  Relationship to the Remote Network Monitoring MIB

   RMON MIB implementations use protocol identifiers to describe
   unambiguous capabilities in protocolDirTable entries.

4.  MPLS layer protocol identifiers

   This section defines protocol identifiers for MPLS with unambiguous
   names to distinguish MPLS Unicast from MPLS Multicast.

CHILDREN
        "Children of 'ip6' are selected by the value in the Protocol
        field (one octet), as defined in the PROTOCOL NUMBERS table
        within the Assigned Numbers Document.

        The value of the Protocol field is encoded in an octet string as
        [ 0.0.0.a ], where 'a' is the protocol field.
        Children of 'ip6' are encoded as [ 0.0.0.a ], and named as 'ip6
        a' where 'a' is the protocol field value.  For example, a
        protocolDirID-fragment value of:
          0.0.0.1.0.0.0.41.0.0.0.58

        defines an encapsulation of IPv6-ICMP (ether2.ip6.icmp6)"

        the agent. E.g., (full INDEX values shown):
