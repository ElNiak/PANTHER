           Prohibiting Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Version 2.0

Abstract

   This document requires that when Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   clients and servers establish connections, they never negotiate the
   use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0.  This document updates
   the backward compatibility sections found in the Transport Layer
   Security (TLS).

RFC 6176                   Prohibiting SSL 2.0                March 2011


1.  Introduction

   Many protocols specified in the IETF rely on Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2] for security services.  This is a good
   thing, but some TLS clients and servers also support negotiating the
   use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0 [SSL2]; however, this
   version does not provide a sufficiently high level of security.  SSL
   version 2.0 has known deficiencies.  This document describes those
   deficiencies, and it requires that TLS clients and servers never
   negotiate the use of SSL version 2.0.

   RFC 4346 [TLS1.1], and later RFC 5246 [TLS1.2], explicitly warned
   implementers that the "ability to send version 2.0 CLIENT-HELLO
   messages will be phased out with all due haste".  This document
   accomplishes this by updating the backward compatibility sections
   found in TLS [TLS1.0][TLS1.1][TLS1.2].

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  SSL 2.0 Deficiencies

   SSL version 2.0 [SSL2] deficiencies include the following:

   o  Message authentication uses MD5 [MD5].  Most security-aware users
      have already moved away from any use of MD5 [RFC6151].

   o  Handshake messages are not protected.  This permits a man-in-the-
      middle to trick the client into picking a weaker cipher suite than
      it would normally choose.

   o  Message integrity and message encryption use the same key, which
      is a problem if the client and server negotiate a weak encryption
      algorithm.

   o  Sessions can be easily terminated.  A man-in-the-middle can easily
      insert a TCP FIN to close the session, and the peer is unable to
      determine whether or not it was a legitimate end of the session.

3.  Changes to TLS

   Because of the deficiencies noted in the previous section:

   o  TLS clients MUST NOT send the SSL version 2.0 compatible CLIENT-
      HELLO message format.  Clients MUST NOT send any ClientHello
      message that specifies a protocol version less than
      { 0x03, 0x00 }.  As previously stated by the definitions of all
      previous versions of TLS, the client SHOULD specify the highest
      protocol version it supports.

   o  TLS servers MAY continue to accept ClientHello messages in the
      version 2 CLIENT-HELLO format as specified in RFC 5246 [TLS1.2],
      Appendix E.2.  Note that this does not contradict the prohibition
      against actually negotiating the use of SSL 2.0.

   o  TLS servers MUST NOT reply with an SSL 2.0 SERVER-HELLO with a
      protocol version that is less than { 0x03, 0x00 } and instead MUST
      abort the connection, i.e., when the highest protocol version
      offered by the client is { 0x02, 0x00 }, the TLS connection will
      be refused.

   Note that the number of servers that support this above-mentioned
   "MAY accept" implementation option is declining, and the SSL 2.0
   CLIENT-HELLO precludes the use of TLS protocol enhancements that
   require TLS extensions.  TLS extensions can only be sent as part of
   an (Extended) ClientHello handshake message.

4.  Security Considerations
