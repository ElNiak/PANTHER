1.  Introduction

   This document describes methods for carrying PostScript information
   in the two standard mail systems MIME and X.400, and the conversion
   between them. It uses the notational conventions of [BODYMAP], and
   the conversion is further described in [MIXER].

   Two ways of carrying PostScript in X.400 are described.  One is using
   the FTAM Body Part, and one uses the Extended Body Part originally
   described in RFC 1494.

   The FTAM method is recommended.

2.  The PostScript body part

   Carrying PostScript in X.400 as an Extended Body Part was originally
   defined in RFC 1494.  This specification carries that work forward
   now that RFC 1494 is obsoleted by [BODYMAP].

   The following Extended Body Part is defined for PostScript data
   streams.  It has no parameters.


      postscript-body-part EXTENDED-BODY-PART-TYPE
        DATA             OCTET STRING
        ::= mime-postscript-body

      mime-postscript-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                { mixer-bp-data 2 }

3.  The PostScript FTBP

   The PostScript FTBP is identified by having the
   FileTransferParameters.environment.application-reference set to id-
   mime-ftbp-postscript.

   The definition is:

    id-mime-ftbp-postscript OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
                       { mixer-bp-data 6 }

4.  The Application/PostScript content-type

   In MIME, PostScript is carried in the body part
   "application/PostScript", which is defined in RFC 1521.

5.  MIXER conversion

   X.400 Body Part: Extended Body Part, OID mime-postscript-body MIME
   Content-Type: application/postscript Conversion Type: No conversion

   The two representations of PostScript both contain a single stream of
   octets. This stream of octets can be copied with no problems between
   the representations. No other data needs to be converted.

6.  MIXER conversion

   X.400 Body Part: FTBP, OID mime-ftbp-postscript-body MIME Content-
   Type: application/postscript Conversion Type: No conversion

   octets. This stream of octets can be copied with no problems between
   the representations. No other data needs to be converted.

7.  OID Assignments

   The first OID is also defined in [BODYMAP].

    POSTSCRIPT-MAPPINGS DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN
    EXPORTS -- everything --;

    IMPORTS
       mixer-bp-data
           FROM MIXER-MAPPINGS

    id-mime-postscript-body OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { mixer-bp-data 2 };
    id-mime-ftbp-postscript OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
            { mixer-bp-data 6 };

    END

8.  Security Issues

   The issues concerning PostScript and security are well discussed in
   RFC 2046.  No additional security issues are identified by this memo.

9.  Trademark Issues

   PostScript is a trademark of Adobe Systems, Inc.
