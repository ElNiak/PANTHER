1.  Introduction

   The Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] is used to
   measure network performance parameters such as latency, bandwidth,
   and packet loss by sending probe packets and measuring their
   experience in the network.  To date, TWAMP implementations do not
   come with a standard management framework, and, as such, implementers
   have no choice except to provide a proprietary mechanism.  This
   document addresses this gap by defining the model using Unified
   Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams [UML] and formally specifying
   a TWAMP data model that is compliant with the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342], using YANG 1.1 [RFC7950].

1.1.  Motivation

   In current TWAMP deployments, the lack of a standardized data model
   limits the flexibility to dynamically instantiate TWAMP-based
   measurements across equipment from different vendors.  In large,
   virtualized, and dynamically instantiated infrastructures where
   network functions are placed according to orchestration algorithms,
   proprietary mechanisms for managing TWAMP measurements pose severe
   limitations with respect to programmability.

   Two major trends call for standardizing TWAMP management aspects.
   First, it is expected that in the coming years large-scale and multi-
   vendor TWAMP deployments will become the norm.  From an operations
   perspective, using several vendor-specific TWAMP configuration
   mechanisms when one standard mechanism could provide an alternative
   is expensive and inefficient.  Second, the increasingly software-
   defined and virtualized nature of network infrastructures, based on
   dynamic service chains [NSC] and programmable control and management
   planes [RFC7426], requires a well-defined data model for TWAMP
   implementations.  This document defines such a TWAMP data model and
   specifies it formally using the YANG 1.1 data modeling language
   [RFC7950].

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Document Organization

   The rest of this document is organized as follows.  Section 2
   presents the scope and applicability of this document.  Section 3
   provides a high-level overview of the TWAMP data model.  Section 4
   details the configuration parameters of the data model, and Section 5
   specifies in YANG the TWAMP data model.  Section 6 lists illustrative
   examples that conform to the YANG data model specified in this
   document.  Appendix A elaborates these examples further.

2.  Scope, Model, and Applicability

   The purpose of this document is the specification of a vendor-
   independent data model for TWAMP implementations.

   Figure 1 illustrates a redrawn version of the TWAMP logical model
   found in Section 1.2 of TWAMP [RFC5357].  The figure is annotated
   with pointers to the UML diagrams [UML] provided in this document and
   associated with the data model of the four logical entities in a
   TWAMP deployment, namely the TWAMP Control-Client, Server, Session-
   Sender, and Session-Reflector.  A UML Notation Guide is available in
   Section 5 of UML [UML].

   As per TWAMP [RFC5357], unlabeled links in Figure 1 are left
   unspecified and may be proprietary protocols.

                  Figure 1: Annotated TWAMP Logical Model

   As per TWAMP [RFC5357], a TWAMP implementation may follow a
   simplified logical model, in which the same node acts as both
   Control-Client and Session-Sender, while another node acts at the
   same time as both TWAMP Server and Session-Reflector.  Figure 2
   illustrates this simplified logical model and indicates the
   interaction between the TWAMP configuration client and server using,
   for instance, NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].

               Figure 2: Simplified TWAMP Model and Protocols

   The data model defined in this document is orthogonal to the specific
   protocol used between the Config client and Config server to
   communicate the TWAMP configuration parameters.

   Operational actions such as how TWAMP-Test sessions are started and
   stopped, how performance measurement results are retrieved, or how
   stored results are cleared, and so on, are not addressed by the
   configuration model defined in this document.  As noted above, such
   operational actions are not part of the TWAMP specification [RFC5357]
   and hence are out of scope for this document.  See also Appendix B.
   In addition, for operational state, the information provided in the
   Performance Metrics Registry [RFC8911] and [PERF-METRICS] can be used
   to develop an independent model for the Performance Metrics that need
   to be captured and retrieved.

3.  Data Model Overview

   The TWAMP data model includes four categories of configuration items.

   First, global configuration items relate to parameters that are set
   on a per-device level.  For example, the administrative status of the
   device with respect to whether it allows TWAMP sessions and, if so,
   in what capacity (e.g., Control-Client, Server, or both) is a typical
   instance of a global configuration item.

   A second category includes attributes that can be configured on a
   per-TWAMP-Control-connection basis, such as the Server IP address.

   A third category includes attributes related to per-TWAMP-Test-
   session attributes -- for instance, setting different values in the
   Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field.

   Finally, the data model includes attributes that relate to the
   operational state of the TWAMP implementation.

   As the TWAMP data model is described in the remaining sections of
   this document, readers should keep in mind the functional entity
   grouping illustrated in Figure 1.

3.1.  Control-Client

   A TWAMP Control-Client has an administrative status field set at the
   device level that indicates whether the node is enabled to function
   as such.

   Each TWAMP Control-Client is associated with zero or more
   TWAMP-Control connections.  The main configuration parameters of each
   control connection are:

   *  A name that can be used to uniquely identify at the Control-Client
      a particular control connection.  This name is necessary for
      programmability reasons because at the time of creation of a
      TWAMP-Control connection not all IP and TCP port number
      information needed to uniquely identify the connection is
      available.

   *  The IP address of the interface the Control-Client will use for
      connections.

   *  The IP address of the remote TWAMP Server.

   *  Authentication and encryption attributes such as KeyID, Token, and
      the Control-Client Initialization Vector (Client-IV); see also
      Section 3.1 of "A One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)"
      [RFC4656] and "Randomness Requirements for Security" [RFC4086].

   Each TWAMP-Control connection, in turn, is associated with zero or
   more TWAMP-Test sessions.  For each test session, the following
   configuration items should be noted:

   *  The test session name, which uniquely identifies a particular test
      session at the Control-Client and Session-Sender.  Similar to the
      control connections mentioned above, this unique test session name
      is needed because at the time of creation of a TWAMP-Test session,
      for example, the source UDP port number is not known to uniquely
      identify the test session.

   *  The IP address and UDP port number of the Session-Sender on the
      path under test by TWAMP.

   *  The IP address and UDP port number of the Session-Reflector on
      said path.

   *  Information pertaining to the test packet stream, such as the test
      starting time; which Performance Metric is to be used, as defined
      in "Registry for Performance Metrics" [RFC8911]; or whether the
      test should be repeated.

3.2.  Server

   Each TWAMP Server has an administrative status field set at the
   device level to indicate whether the node is enabled to function as a
   TWAMP Server.

   Each Server is associated with zero or more TWAMP-Control
   connections.  Each control connection is uniquely identified by the
   4-tuple {Control-Client IP address, Control-Client TCP port number,
   Server IP address, Server TCP port}.  Control connection
   configuration items on a TWAMP Server are read-only.

3.3.  Session-Sender

   A TWAMP Session-Sender has an administrative status field set at the
   device level that indicates whether the node is enabled to function
   as such.

   There is one Session-Sender instance for each TWAMP-Test session that
   is initiated from the sending device.  Primary configuration fields
   include:

   *  The test session name, which MUST be identical to the
      corresponding test session name on the TWAMP Control-Client
      (Section 3.1).

   *  The control connection name, which, along with the test session
      name, uniquely identifies the TWAMP Session-Sender instance.

   *  Information pertaining to the test packet stream, such as the
      number of test packets and the packet distribution to be employed;
      see also "Network performance measurement with periodic streams"
      [RFC3432].

3.4.  Session-Reflector

   Each TWAMP Session-Reflector has an administrative status field set
   at the device level to indicate whether the node is enabled to
   function as such.

   Each Session-Reflector is associated with zero or more TWAMP-Test
   sessions.  For each test session, the REFWAIT timeout parameter,
   which determines whether to discontinue the session if no packets
   have been received (TWAMP [RFC5357], Section 4.2), can be configured.

   Read-only access to other data model parameters, such as the Sender
   IP address, is foreseen.  Each test session can be uniquely
   identified by the 4-tuple mentioned in Section 3.2.

4.  Data Model Parameters

   This section defines the TWAMP data model using UML [UML] and
   introduces selected parameters associated with the four TWAMP logical
   entities.  The complete TWAMP data model specification is provided in
   the YANG module presented in Section 5.2.

4.1.  Control-Client

   The client container (see Figure 3) holds items that are related to
   the configuration of the TWAMP Control-Client logical entity (recall
   Figure 1).

   The client container includes an administrative configuration
   parameter (client/admin-state) that indicates whether the device is
   allowed to initiate TWAMP-Control connections.

                 | pm-index    |        | sid             {ro} |
                 +-------------+        +----------------------+

              Figure 3: TWAMP Control-Client UML Class Diagram

   The client container holds a list (mode-preference-chain) that
   specifies the mode values according to their preferred order of use
   by the operator of this Control-Client, including the authentication
   and encryption modes.  Specifically, mode-preference-chain lists the
   mode and its corresponding priority, expressed as a 16-bit unsigned
   integer.  Values for the priority start with zero, the highest
   priority, and decreasing priority value is indicated by every
   increase in value by one.

   Depending on the modes available in the Server Greeting, the Control-
   Client MUST choose the highest-priority mode from the configured
   mode-preference-chain list.

   Note that the list of preferred modes may set multiple bit positions
   independently, such as when referring to the extended TWAMP features
   in "Mixed Security Mode for the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol
   (TWAMP)" [RFC5618], "Individual Session Control Feature for the
   Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)" [RFC5938], "Two-Way
   Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Reflect Octets and Symmetrical
   Size Features" [RFC6038], and "IKEv2-Derived Shared Secret Key for
   the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way Active
   Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)" [RFC7717].  If the Control-Client
   cannot determine an acceptable mode, or when the bit combinations do
   not make sense, e.g., authenticated and unauthenticated bits are both
   set, it MUST respond with zero Mode bits set in the Set-Up-Response
   message, indicating that it will not continue with the control
   connection.

   In addition, the client container holds a list named "key-chain",
   which relates key-id with the respective secret-key.  Both the Server
   and the Control-Client use the same mappings from key-id to
   secret-key (in Figure 3); in order for this to work properly, key-id
   must be unique across all systems in the administrative domain.  The
   Server, being prepared to conduct sessions with more than one
   Control-Client, uses key-id to choose the appropriate secret-key; a
   Control-Client would typically have different secret keys for
   different Servers.  The secret-key is the shared secret, of type
   "binary", and the length SHOULD contain at least 128 bits of entropy.
   The key-id and secret-key encoding SHOULD follow Section 9.8 of YANG
   [RFC7950].  The derived key length (dkLen as defined in "PKCS #5:
   Password-Based Cryptography Specification Version 2.1" [RFC8018])
   MUST be 16 octets for the AES Session-key used for encryption and
   32 octets for the HMAC-SHA1 Session-key used for authentication; see
   also Section 6.10 of OWAMP [RFC4656].

   Each client container also holds a list of control connections, where
   each item in the list describes a TWAMP-Control connection initiated
   by this Control-Client.  There SHALL be one ctrl-connection per
   TWAMP-Control (TCP) connection that is to be initiated from this
   device.

   In turn, each ctrl-connection holds a test-session-request list.
   Each test-session-request holds information associated with the
   Control-Client for this test session.  This includes information
   associated with the Request-TW-Session/Accept-Session message
   exchange (see Section 3.5 of TWAMP [RFC5357]).

   There SHALL be one instance of test-session-request for each
   TWAMP-Test session that is to be negotiated by this TWAMP-Control
   connection via a Request-TW-Session/Accept-Session exchange.

   The Control-Client is also responsible for scheduling TWAMP-Test
   sessions; therefore, test-session-request holds information related
   to these actions (e.g., pm-index, repeat-interval).

4.2.  Server

   The server container (see Figure 4) holds items that are related to
   the configuration of the TWAMP Server logical entity (recall
   Figure 1).

   The server container includes an administrative configuration
   parameter (server/admin-state) that indicates whether the device is
   allowed to receive TWAMP-Control connections.

   A device operating in the Server Role cannot configure attributes on
   a per-TWAMP-Control-connection basis, as it has no foreknowledge of
   the incoming TWAMP-Control connections to be received.  Consequently,
   any parameter that the Server might want to apply to an incoming
   control connection must be configured at the overall Server level and
   applied to all incoming TWAMP-Control connections.

       +---------------------+
       | server              |
       +---------------------+

                  Figure 4: TWAMP Server UML Class Diagram

   Each server container holds a list named "key-chain", which relates
   key-id with the respective secret-key.  As mentioned in Section 4.1,
   both the Server and the Control-Client use the same mapping from
   key-id to the shared secret-key; in order for this to work properly,
   key-id must be unique across all the systems in the administrative
   domain.  The Server, being prepared to conduct sessions with more
   than one Control-Client, uses key-id to choose the appropriate
   secret-key; a Control-Client would typically have different secret
   keys for different Servers.  key-id tells the Server which shared
   secret-key the Control-Client wishes to use for authentication or
   encryption.

   Each incoming control connection active on the Server is represented
   by a ctrl-connection.  There SHALL be one ctrl-connection per
   incoming TWAMP-Control (TCP) connection that is received and active
   on the Server.  Each ctrl-connection can be uniquely identified by
   the 4-tuple {client-ip, client-tcp-port, server-ip, server-tcp-
   port}.  All items in the ctrl-connection list are read-only.

4.3.  Session-Sender

   The session-sender container, illustrated in Figure 5, holds items
   that are related to the configuration of the TWAMP Session-Sender
   logical entity.

   The session-sender container includes an administrative parameter
   (session-sender/admin-state) that controls whether the device is
   allowed to initiate TWAMP-Test sessions.

              Figure 5: TWAMP Session-Sender UML Class Diagram

   Each TWAMP-Test session initiated by the Session-Sender will be
   represented by an instance of a test-session object.  There SHALL be
   one instance of test-session for each TWAMP-Test session for which
   packets are being sent.

4.4.  Session-Reflector

   The session-reflector container, illustrated in Figure 6, holds items
   that are related to the configuration of the TWAMP Session-Reflector
   logical entity.

   The session-reflector container includes an administrative parameter
   (session-reflector/admin-state) that controls whether the device is
   allowed to respond to incoming TWAMP-Test sessions.

   A device operating in the Session-Reflector Role cannot configure
   attributes on a per-session basis, as it has no foreknowledge of what
   incoming sessions it will receive.  As such, any parameter that the
   Session-Reflector might want to apply to an incoming TWAMP-Test
   session must be configured at the overall Session-Reflector level and
   applied to all incoming sessions.

            Figure 6: TWAMP Session-Reflector UML Class Diagram

   Each incoming TWAMP-Test session that is active on the Session-
   Reflector SHALL be represented by an instance of a test-session
   object.  All items in the test-session object are read-only.

   Instances of test-session are indexed by a Session Identifier (SID)
   (the sid parameter).  This SID value is auto-allocated by the TWAMP
   Server as test session requests are received and is communicated back
   to the Control-Client in the SID field of the Accept-Session message;
   see Section 4.3 of "Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)
   Reflect Octets and Symmetrical Size Features" [RFC6038].

   When attempting to retrieve operational data for active test sessions
   from a Session-Reflector device, the user will not know what sessions
   are currently active on that device or what SIDs have been
   auto-allocated for these test sessions.  If the user has network
   access to the Control-Client device, then it is possible to read the
   data for this session under client/ctrl-connection/test-session-
   request/sid and obtain the SID (see Figure 3).  The user may then use
   this SID value as an index to retrieve an individual session-
   reflector/test-session instance on the Session-Reflector device.

   If the user has no network access to the Control-Client device, then
   the only option is to retrieve all test-session instances from the
   Session-Reflector device and then pick out specific test-session
   instances of interest to the user.  This could be problematic if a
   large number of test sessions are currently active on that device.

   Each Session-Reflector TWAMP-Test session contains the following
   4-tuple: {parent-connection-client-ip, parent-connection-client-tcp-
   port, parent-connection-server-ip, parent-connection-server-tcp-
   port}.  This 4-tuple MUST correspond to the equivalent 4-tuple
   {client-ip, client-tcp-port, server-ip, server-tcp-port} in
   server/ctrl-connection.  This 4-tuple allows the user to trace back
   from the TWAMP-Test session to the (parent) TWAMP-Control connection
   that negotiated this test session.

5.  Data Model

   This section formally specifies the TWAMP data model using YANG.

5.1.  YANG Tree Diagram

   This section presents a simplified graphical representation of the
   TWAMP data model using a YANG tree diagram.  Readers should keep in
   mind that the limit of 72 characters per line forces us to introduce
   artificial line breaks in some tree diagram nodes.  Tree diagrams
   used in this document follow the notation defined in "YANG Tree
   Diagrams" [RFC8340].

   Please note that the backslash ('\') character near the end of the
   diagram is used for formatting purposes only (i.e.,
   "reflector-udp-port]" should be treated as part of the same line as
   "[sender-ip sender-udp-port reflector-ip").

5.2.  YANG Module

   This section presents the YANG module for the TWAMP data model
   defined in this document.  The module imports definitions from
   "Common YANG Data Types" [RFC6991] and references "Framework for IP
   Performance Metrics" [RFC2330], "Network performance measurement with
   periodic streams" [RFC3432], "A One-way Active Measurement Protocol
   (OWAMP)" [RFC4656], "A Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"
   [RFC5357], "Mixed Security Mode for the Two-Way Active Measurement
   Protocol (TWAMP)" [RFC5618], "Network Time Protocol Version 4:
   Protocol and Algorithms Specification" [RFC5905], "Individual Session
   Control Feature for the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)"
   [RFC5938], "Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Reflect
   Octets and Symmetrical Size Features" [RFC6038], "Advanced Stream and
   Sampling Framework for IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)" [RFC7312],

     description
       "This YANG module specifies a vendor-independent data
        model for the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP).

        The data model defines four TWAMP logical entities, namely
        Control-Client, Server, Session-Sender, and Session-Reflector,
        as illustrated in the annotated TWAMP logical model (Figure 1
        of RFC 8913).

        This YANG module uses features to indicate which of the four
        logical entities are supported by a TWAMP implementation.

        The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL
        NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', 'NOT RECOMMENDED',
        'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119) (RFC 8174) when, and only when,
        they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

            The default is 20, meaning 2^20 = 1048576.

            A TWAMP Server uses this configured value in the

            A TWAMP Control-Client uses this configured value to

            control connection to the Server if it 'receives a

            maximum configured value', as per Section 6 of RFC 5357.

            Further, note that according to Section 6 of RFC 5357:

            'If an attacking system set the maximum value in Count
            (2**32), then the system under attack would stall for a
            significant period of time while it attempts to generate
            keys.  Therefore, TWAMP-compliant systems SHOULD have a
            configuration control to limit the maximum Count value.
            The default maximum Count value SHOULD be 32768.'

            In the case of this document, the default max-count-exponent
            value SHOULD be 15, which corresponds to a maximum value of
            2**15 or 32768.

            RFC 5357 does not qualify 'significant period' in terms of
            time, but it is clear that this depends on the processing
            capacity available, and operators need to pay attention to
            this security consideration.";

6.  Data Model Examples

   This section presents simple but complete examples of configuring all
   four entities in Figure 1, based on the YANG module specified in
   Section 5.  The examples are illustrative in nature but aim to be
   self-contained, i.e., were they to be executed in a real TWAMP
   implementation, they would lead to correctly configured test
   sessions.  For completeness, examples are provided for both IPv4 and
   IPv6.  The examples are shown using XML [W3C.REC-xml-20081126].

   More elaborate examples, which also include authentication
   parameters, are provided in Appendix A.

6.1.  Control-Client

   Figure 8 shows a configuration example for a Control-Client with
   client/admin-state enabled.  In a real implementation following
   Figure 2, this would permit the initiation of TWAMP-Control
   connections and TWAMP-Test sessions.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <config xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <twamp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp">
       <client>
         <admin-state>true</admin-state>
       </client>
     </twamp>
   </config>

          Figure 8: XML Instance Enabling Control-Client Operation

   The following example shows a Control-Client with two instances of
   client/ctrl-connection -- one called "RouterA" and another called
   "RouterB".  Each TWAMP-Control connection is to a different Server.
   The control connection named "RouterA" has two test session requests.
   The TWAMP-Control connection named "RouterB" has no TWAMP-Test
   session requests.

     </twamp>
   </config>

6.2.  Server

   Figure 9 shows a configuration example for a Server with
   server/admin-state enabled, which permits a device following Figure 2
   to respond to TWAMP-Control connections and TWAMP-Test sessions.

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <config xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <twamp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp">

7.  Security Considerations

   Virtually all existing measurement systems using TWAMP [RFC5357] are
   administered by the same network operator.  For example, attacks on
   the measurement infrastructure could be launched by third parties to
   commandeer the packet generation capability, corrupt the
   measurements, or perform other nefarious acts.

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  If written, the 'admin-state' node can cause unintended test
      sessions to be created.

   *  If the node 'number-of-packets', which dictates how many packets
      are sent in any particular test session, is written with a large
      value, it can cause a test session to run longer than expected.

   *  Nodes that are particularly vulnerable include several timeout
      values put in the protocol to protect against sessions that are
      not active but are consuming resources.  These are the REFWAIT
      timeout parameter, which determines whether to discontinue the
      session if no packets are received; and the nodes 'count' and
      'max-count-exponent', which can cause a long time to be spent on
      Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) iterations.

   *  In addition, a 'dscp' node marked with different DSCP markings can
      cause the test traffic on the network to be skewed and the result
      manipulated.

   *  Finally, nodes within 'mode-preference-chain', which specifies the
      'mode' and 'priority' values and indicates the preferred order of
      use by an operator, can be manipulated to send unauthenticated or
      non-encrypted traffic, enabling an on-path attack.

   *  Limiting access to these nodes will limit the ability to launch an
      attack in network environments.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  This is the subtree and data node
   and its sensitivity/vulnerability:

   *  The 'token' node defined in the model, containing a concatenation
      of a Challenge, an AES Session-key used for encryption, and an
      HMAC-SHA1 Session-key used for authentication, is sensitive from a
      privacy perspective and can be used to disrupt a test session.
      The ability to read the field should be limited to the
      administrator of the test network.

   The TWAMP YANG data model does not define RPC operations, as detailed
   in Appendix B, and defers the definition of NETCONF RPC operations to
   each implementation.  These RPC operations, when defined, may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control access to these operations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has registered the following URI in the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp
   Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   IANA has registered the following YANG module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry [RFC6020].

   Name:  ietf-twamp
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-twamp

Appendix B.  TWAMP Operational Commands

   TWAMP operational commands could be performed programmatically or
   manually, e.g., using a command-line interface (CLI).

   With respect to programmability, YANG can be used to define NETCONF
   Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs); therefore, it would be, in principle,
   possible to define TWAMP RPC operations for actions such as starting
   or stopping control connections, test sessions, or groups of
   sessions; retrieving results; clearing stored results; and so on.

   However, TWAMP [RFC5357] does not attempt to describe such
   operational actions.  Refer also to Section 2 and the unlabeled links
   in Figure 1.  In actual deployments, different TWAMP implementations
   may support different sets of operational commands, with different
   restrictions.  Therefore, this document considers it the
   responsibility of the individual implementation to define its
   corresponding data model for TWAMP operational commands.
