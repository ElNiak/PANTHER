   that was held at ISI on 28 and 29 February 1984.  Robert Hinden of
   BBNCC chaired, and Jon Postel of ISI hosted the meeting.
   Approximately 35 gateway designers and implementors attended.  These
   notes are based on the recollections of Jon Postel and Mike Muuss.
   Under each topic area are Jon Postel's brief notes, and additional
   details from Mike Muuss.  This memo is a report on a meeting.  No
   conclusions, decisions, or policy statements are documented in this
   note.

897     Postel       Feb 84      Domain Name System Implementation
                                 Schedule

   This memo is a policy statement on the implementation of the Domain
   Style Naming System in the Internet.  This memo is a partial update
   of RFC 881.  The intent of this memo is to detail the schedule for
   the implementation for the Domain Style Naming System.  The names of
   hosts will be changed to domain style names.  Hosts will begin to use
   domain style names on 14-Mar-84, and the use of old style names will
   be completely phased out before 2-May-84.  This applies to both the
   ARPA research hosts and the DDN operational hosts.  This is an
   official policy statement of the ICCB and the DARPA.

   This RFC specifies a draft standard for the ARPA Internet community.
   It describes a resource location protocol for use in the ARPA
   Internet.  It is most useful on networks employing technologies which
   support some method of broadcast addressing, however it may also be
   used on other types of networks.  For maximum benefit, all hosts
   which provide significant resources or services to other hosts on the
   Internet should implement this protocol.  Hosts failing to implement
   the Resource Location Protocol risk being ignored by other hosts
   which are attempting to locate resources on the Internet.

886     Rose         Dec 83      Proposed Standard for Message Header

854     Postel       May 83      Telnet Protocol Specifications

   This is the specification of the Telnet protocol used for remote
   terminal access in the ARPA Internet.  The purpose of the TELNET
   Protocol is to provide a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit
   byte oriented communications facility.  Its primary goal is to allow
   a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and
   terminal-oriented processes to each other.  It is envisioned that the
   protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal communication
   ("linking") and process-process communication (distributed
   computation).   This RFC specifies a standard for the ARPA Internet
   community.  Hosts on the ARPA Internet are expected to adopt and
   implement this standard.  Obsoletes NIC 18639.

   This memo is distributed as an RFC only to make this information
   easily accessible to researchers in the ARPA community.  It does not
   specify an Internet standard.  This RFC defines the standard format
   for interchange of Network News articles among USENET sites.  It
   describes the format for articles themselves, and gives partial
   standards for transmission of news.  The news transmission is not
   entirely standardized in order to give a good deal of flexibility to
   the individual hosts to choose transmission hardware and software,
   whether to batch news and so on.

                                 February 1983

   This survey determines how many hosts are able to respond to TELENET
   connections from a user at a class C site.  This requires, in
   addition to IP and TCP, participation in gateway routing via ICMP and
   handling of Class C addresses.  The list of hosts was taken from RFC
   843, extracting only those hosts which are listed there as accepting
   TELNET connection.  The tests were run on 18-Feb-83.

   This RFC describes an alternate approach of dealing with reassembly
   which reduces the bookkeeping problem to a minimum, and requires only
   one buffer for storage equal in size to the final datagram being
   reassembled, which can reassemble a datagram from any number of
   fragments arriving in any order with any possible pattern of overlap
   and duplication, and which is appropriate for almost any sort of
   operating system.

   mechanisms in TCP, the window and the acknowledgement.  It also
   presents a particular set of algorithms which have received testing
   in the field, and which appear to work properly with each other.
   With more experience, these algorithms may become part of the formal
   specification, until such time their use is recommended.

802     Malis        Nov 81      The ARPANET 1822L Host Access Protocol

   This document proposed two major changes to the current ARPANET host
   access protocol.  The first change will allow hosts to use logical
   addressing (i.e., host addresses that are independent of their
   physical location on the ARPANET) to communicate with each other, and
   the second will allow a host to shorten the amount of time that it
   may be blocked by its IMP after it presents a message to the network
   (currently, the IMP can block further input from a host for up to 15
   seconds).  See RFCs 852 and 851.
