Abstract

   This document registers with the IANA a new media feature tag
   associated with the 'message' media type.  This media feature tag
   indicates that a particular device supports 'message' as a streaming
   media type.  Media feature tags can be used to route calls to devices
   that support certain features.

RFC 4569                  Message Feature Tag                  July 2006


1.  Introduction

   The Session Description Protocol (SDP) specification [5] defines a
   number of media types.  RFC 3840 [4] registers with the IANA media
   feature tags associated with all those media types except for the
   'message' media type.  This document registers a new media feature
   tag that is associated with the 'message' media type.

   The reason why the 'message' media feature tag was not registered by
   RFC 3840 was that when RFC 3840 was published, the SDP specification
   was RFC 2327 [1].  RFC 3840 defined media feature tags for all the
   media types defined by RFC 2327.  However, RFC 2327 did not define
   the 'message' media type.  This media type was defined by the revised
   SDP specification [5], which was published after RFC 3840.

2.  Security Considerations

   Section 11.1 of RFC 3840 [4] discusses security considerations
   related to the use of media feature tags.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers a new media feature tag in the SIP [3]
   tree per the procedures defined in RFC 2506 [2] and RFC 3840 [4].

      Media feature tag name: sip.message

      ASN.1 Identifier: 21

      Summary of the media feature indicated by this tag: This feature
      tag indicates that the device supports message as a streaming
      media type.

      Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: Boolean.

      The feature tag is intended primarily for use in the following
      applications, protocols, services, or negotiation mechanisms: This
      feature tag is most useful in a communications application for
      describing the capabilities of a device, such as a phone or PDA.

      Examples of typical use: Routing a call to a phone that can
      support session-based instant messaging.

      Related standards or documents: RFC 4569.

      Security Considerations: Security considerations for this media
      feature tag are discussed in Section 11.1 of RFC 3840.
