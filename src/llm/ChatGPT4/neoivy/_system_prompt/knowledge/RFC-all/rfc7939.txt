 Definition of Managed Objects for the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol

Abstract

   This document replaces RFC 6779; it contains revisions and extensions
   to the original document.  It defines a portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in
   the Internet community.  In particular, it describes objects for
   configuring parameters of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
   process on a router.  The extensions described in this document add
   objects and values to support the NHDP optimization specified in RFC
   7466.  The MIB module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB,
   also reports state, performance information, and notifications about
   NHDP.  This additional state and performance information is useful to
   troubleshoot problems and performance issues during neighbor
   discovery.

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


1.  Introduction

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, it describes objects for configuring
   parameters of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood
   Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130] process on a router.  The MIB
   module defined in this document, denoted NHDP-MIB, also reports
   state, performance information, and notifications about NHDP.  This
   additional state and performance information is useful to
   troubleshoot problems and performance issues during neighbor
   discovery.

1.1.  Differences from RFC 6779

   This document obsoletes [RFC6779], replacing that document as the
   specification of the MIB module for [RFC6130].  This revision to
   [RFC6779] is necessitated by the update to [RFC6130] specified in
   [RFC7466].

   The MIB module for [RFC6130], specified in this document, captures
   the new information and states for each symmetric 2-hop neighbor,
   recorded in the Neighbor Information Base of a router and to be
   reflected in the appropriate tables, introduced by [RFC7466],
   specifically:

   o  Addition of objects nhdpIib2HopSetN2Lost and
      nhdpIfPerfCounterDiscontinuityTime.

   o  Addition of extra value (notconsidered) to nhdp2HopNbrState.

   o  Revised full compliance state.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   [RFC6130] allows a router to discover and track topological
   information of routers up to two hops away by virtue of exchanging
   HELLO messages.  This information is useful for routers running
   various routing and multicast flooding protocols developed within the
   IETF MANET Working Group.

4.1.  Terms

   The following definitions apply throughout this document:

   o  Notification Objects - triggers and associated notification
      messages allowing for asynchronous tracking of predefined events
      on the managed router.

   o  Configuration Objects - switches, tables, and objects that are
      initialized to default settings or set through the management
      interface defined by this MIB module.

   o  State Objects - automatically generated values that define the
      current operating state of the NHDP instance in the router.

   o  Performance Objects - automatically generated values that help to
      assess the performance of the NHDP instance on the router and the
      overall discovery performance within the MANET.

4.2.  Notation

   The same notations as defined in [RFC6130] are used throughout this
   document.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

   This section presents the structure of the NHDP-MIB module.  The MIB
   module is arranged into the following structure:

   o  nhdpNotifications - objects defining NHDP-MIB notifications.






Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


   o  nhdpObjects - defining objects within this MIB module.  The
      objects are arranged into the following groups:

      *  Configuration Group - defining objects related to the
         configuration of the NHDP instance on the router.

      *  State Group - defining objects that reflect the current state
         of the NHDP instance running on the router.

      *  Performance Group - defining objects that are useful to a
         management station when characterizing the performance of NHDP
         on the router and in the MANET.

   o  nhdpConformance - defining the minimal and maximal conformance
      requirements for implementations of this MIB module.

5.1.  Notifications

   This section describes the use of notifications and mechanisms to
   enhance the ability to manage NHDP routing domains.

5.1.1.  Introduction

   Notifications can be emitted by a router running an instance of this
   specification as a reaction to a specific event.  This allows an
   observer of these events to efficiently determine the source of
   problems or significant changes of configuration or topology, instead
   of polling a possibly large number of routers.

5.1.2.  Notification Generation

   When an exception event occurs, the application notifies the local
   agent, which sends a notification to the appropriate SNMP management
   stations.  The message includes the notification type and may include
   a list of notification-specific variables.  Section 7 contains the
   notification definitions, which includes the variable lists.  At
   least one IP address of the router that originates the notification
   is included in the variable list so that the source of the
   notification may be determined.

5.1.3.  Limiting Frequency of Notifications

   To limit the frequency of notifications, the following additional
   mechanisms are suggested, similar to those in [RFC4750].







Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


5.1.3.1.  Ignoring Initial Activity

   The majority of critical events occur when NHDP is first enabled on a
   router, at which time, the symmetric neighbors and 2-hop neighbors of
   the router are discovered.  During this initial period, a potential
   flood of notifications is unnecessary since the events are expected.
   To avoid unnecessary notifications, a router SHOULD NOT originate
   expected notifications until a predefined and administratively
   configured time interval has elapsed.  It is RECOMMENDED that this
   time interval be at least 3 times nhdpHelloInterval so that symmetric
   neighbors are discovered.  The suppression window for notifications
   is started when the nhdpIfStatus transitions from its default value
   of 'false(2)' to 'true(1)'.

5.1.3.2.  Throttling Notifications

   The mechanism for throttling the notifications is the same as in
   [RFC4750] (i.e., the number of transmitted notifications per time is
   bounded).

   Appropriate values for the window time and upper bound are to be
   administratively configured and depend on the deployment of the
   MANET.  If NHDP is deployed on a lossy, wireless medium, sending too
   many notifications in a short time interval may lead to collisions
   and dropped packets.  In particular, in dense deployments of routers
   running NHDP (i.e., where each router has many neighbors), a change
   of the local topology may trigger many notifications at the same
   time.  [RFC4750] recommends "7 traps with a window time of 10
   seconds" as the upper bound.  As NHDP is expected to be deployed in
   more lossy channels than OSPF, it is RECOMMENDED to choose a lower
   threshold for the number of notifications per time than that.
   Specifically, it is RECOMMENDED that the threshold value for the
   objects reflecting the change be set to a value of '10' and the
   DEFAULT values for these objects within the Notifications Group be
   set to this value.  Further, a time window for the change objects is
   defined within this MIB module.  If the number of occurrences exceeds
   the change threshold within the previous change window, then it is
   RECOMMENDED that the notification be sent.  Furthermore, it is
   RECOMMENDED that the value for this window be set to at least 5 times
   the nhdpHelloInterval.

   The following objects are used to define the thresholds and time
   windows for specific notifications defined in the NHDP-MIB module:
   nhdpNbrStateChangeThreshold, nhdpNbrStateChangeWindow,
   nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeThreshold, and nhdp2HopNbrStateChangeWindow.

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


5.1.3.3.  One Notification per Event

   Similar to the mechanism in [RFC4750], only one notification is sent
   per event.

5.2.  The Configuration Group

   The router running NHDP is configured with a set of controls.  The
   authoritative list of configuration controls within the NHDP-MIB
   module are found within the MIB module itself.  Generally, an attempt
   was made in developing the NHDP-MIB module to support all
   configuration objects defined in [RFC6130].  For all of the
   configuration parameters, the same constraints and default values of
   these parameters as defined in [RFC6130] are followed.  Refer to
   [RFC5148] for guidance on setting jitter-related parameters, e.g.,
   nhdpMaxJitter.

5.3.  The State Group

   The State Group reports current state information of a router running
   NHDP.  The NHDP-MIB State Group tables were designed to contain the
   complete set of state information defined within the information
   bases specified in Sections 6, 7, and 8 of [RFC6130].

   Two constructs, i.e., TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs, are defined to support the
   tables in the State Group.  NHDP stores and indexes information
   through sets of (dynamically defined) addresses, i.e., address sets.
   Within SMIv2, it is not possible to index tables with variably
   defined address sets.  Hence, these TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs are defined
   to provide a local mapping between NHDP-managed address sets and
   SMIv2 table indexing.  These constructs are the NeighborIfIndex and
   NeighborRouterIndex.  These are locally (to the router) defined,
   unique identifiers of virtual neighbors and neighbor interfaces.  Due
   to the nature of NHDP, the local router may have identified distinct
   address sets but is not able to associate these as a single
   interface.  Hence, two or more NeighborIfIndexes pointing to multiple
   distinct address sets may, in fact, be related to a common neighbor
   interface.  This ambiguity may also hold with respect to the
   assignment of the NeighborRouterIndex.  The local MIB agent is
   responsible for managing, aggregating, and retiring the defined
   indexes and for updating MIB tables using these indexes as the local
   router learns more about its neighbors' topologies.  These constructs
   are used to define indexes to the appropriate State Group tables and
   to correlate table entries to address sets, virtual neighbor
   interfaces, and virtual neighbors within the MANET.

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


5.4.  The Performance Group

   The Performance Group reports values relevant to system performance.
   Unstable neighbors or 2-hop neighbors and frequent changes of sets
   can have a negative influence on the performance of NHDP.  This MIB
   module defines several objects that can be polled in order to, e.g.,
   calculate histories or monitor frequencies of changes.  This may help
   an observer determining unusual topology changes or other changes
   that affect stability and reliability of the MANET.

5.5.  Tables and Indexing

   The NHDP-MIB module contains a number of tables that record data
   related to:

   o  the local router,

   o  a local MANET interface on the router,

   o  other routers that are one hop removed from the local router,

   o  interfaces on other routers that are one hop removed from the
      local router, and

   o  other routers that are two hops removed from the local router.

   The NHDP-MIB module's tables are indexed via the following
   constructs:

   o  nhdpIfIndex - the IfIndex of the local router on which NHDP is
      configured.

   o  nhdpDiscIfIndex - a locally managed index representing a known
      interface on a neighboring router.

   o  nhdpDiscRouterIndex - a locally managed index representing an ID
      of a known neighboring router.

   These tables and their indexing are:

   o  nhdpInterfaceTable - describes the configuration of the interfaces
      of this router.  This table has INDEX { nhdpIfIndex }.

   o  nhdpLibLocalIfSetTable - records all network addresses that are
      defined as local interface network addresses on this router.  This
      table has INDEX { nhdpLibLocalIfSetIndex }.

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


   o  nhdpLibRemovedIfAddrSetTable - records network addresses that were
      recently used as local interface network addresses on this router
      but have been removed.  This table has INDEX
      { nhdpLibRemovedIfAddrSetIndex }.

   o  nhdpInterfaceStateTable - records state information related to
      specific interfaces of this router.  This table has INDEX
      { nhdpIfIndex }.

   o  nhdpDiscIfSetTable - includes the nhdpDiscRouterIndex of the
      discovered router, the nhdpDiscIfIndex of the discovered
      interface, and the current set of addresses associated with this
      neighbor interface.  This table has INDEX { nhdpDiscIfSetIndex }.

   o  nhdpIibLinkSetTable - for each local interface, records all links
      belonging to other routers that are, or recently were, 1-hop
      neighbors to this router.  This table has INDEX { nhdpIfIndex,
      nhdpDiscIfIndex }.

   o  nhdpIib2HopSetTable - for each local interface, records network
      addresses (one at a time) of symmetric 2-hop neighbors and the
      symmetric links to symmetric 1-hop neighbors of this router
      through which these symmetric 2-hop neighbors can be reached.
      This table has INDEX { nhdpIfIndex, nhdpDiscIfIndex,
      nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddressType, nhdpIib2HopSetIpAddress }.

   o  nhdpNibNeighborSetTable - records all network addresses of each
      1-hop neighbor to this router.  This table has INDEX
      { nhdpDiscRouterIndex }.

   o  nhdpNibLostNeighborSetTable - records network addresses of other
      routers that were recently symmetric 1-hop neighbors to this
      router but are now advertised as lost.  This table has INDEX
      { nhdpDiscRouterIndex }.

   o  nhdpInterfacePerfTable - records performance objects that are
      measured for each local NHDP interface on this router.  This table
      has INDEX { nhdpIfIndex }.

   o  nhdpDiscIfSetPerfTable - records performance objects that are
      measured for each discovered interface of a neighbor of this
      router.  This table has INDEX { nhdpDiscIfIndex }.

   o  nhdpDiscNeighborSetPerfTable - records performance objects that
      are measured for discovered neighbors of this router.  This table
      has INDEX { nhdpDiscRouterIndex }.

      measured for discovered 2-hop neighbors of this router.  This
      table has INDEX { nhdpDiscRouterIndex }.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   This section specifies the relationship of the MIB module contained
   in this document to other standards, particularly to standards
   containing other MIB modules.  MIB modules and specific definitions
   imported from MIB modules that SHOULD be implemented in conjunction
   with the MIB module contained within this document are identified in
   this section.

6.1.  Relationship to the SNMPv2-MIB

   The System Group in the SNMPv2-MIB module [RFC3418] is defined as
   being mandatory for all systems, and the objects apply to the entity
   as a whole.  The System Group provides identification of the
   management entity and certain other system-wide data.  The NHDP-MIB
   module does not duplicate those objects.

6.2.  Relationship to Routing Protocol MIB Modules Relying on the NHDP-
      MIB Module

   [RFC6130] allows routing protocols to rely on the neighborhood
   information that is discovered by means of HELLO message exchange.
   In order to allow for troubleshooting, fault isolation, and
   management of such routing protocols through a routing protocol MIB
   module, it may be desired to align the State Group tables of the
   NHDP-MIB module and the routing protocol MIB module.  This is
   accomplished through the definition of two TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONs in the
   NHDP-MIB module: the NeighborIfIndex and the NeighborRouterIndex.
   These object types are used to develop indexes into common NHDP-MIB
   module and routing protocol State Group tables.  These objects are
   locally significant but should be locally common to the NHDP-MIB
   module and the routing protocol MIB module implemented on a common
   networked router.  This will allow for improved cross-referencing of
   information across the two MIB modules.

6.3.  Relationship to the If-MIB

   The nhdpInterfaceTable in this MIB module describes the configuration
   of the interfaces of this router that are intended to use MANET
   control protocols.  As such, this table 'sparse augments' the
   ifTable [RFC2863] specifically when NHDP is to be configured to
   operate over this interface.  The interface is identified by the
   ifIndex from the Interfaces Group defined in the Interfaces Group MIB
   module [RFC2863].



Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 10]

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


   A conceptual row in the nhdpInterfaceTable exists if and only if
   either the row has been administratively created or there is an
   interface on the managed device that supports and runs NHDP.  This
   implies that for each entry in the nhdpInterfaceTable, there is a
   corresponding entry in the Interface Table where nhdpIfIndex and
   ifIndex are equal.  If that corresponding entry in the Interface
   Table is deleted, then the entry in nhdpInterfaceTable is
   automatically deleted, NHDP is disabled on this interface, and all
   configuration and state information related to this interface is to
   be removed from memory.

   DESCRIPTION
      "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
       virtual interface of a discovered NHDP neighbor.
       Due to the nature of NHDP, the local router
       may not know if two distinct addresses belong to the
       same interface of a neighbor or to two different
       interfaces.  As the local router gains more
       knowledge of its neighbors, its local view may change, and
       this table will be updated to reflect the local router's
       current understanding, associating address sets to neighbor
       interfaces.  The local router identifies a virtual neighbor
       interface through the receipt of address lists advertised
       through an NHDP HELLO message.

       All objects of type NeighborIfIndex are assigned by the agent
       out of a common number space.

       The value for each discovered virtual neighbor
       interface may not remain constant from
       one re-initialization of the entity's network management
       agent to the next re-initialization.  If the
       local router gains information associating two virtual
       interfaces on a neighbor as a common interface,

       then the agent MUST aggregate the two address sets to
       a single index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes,
       and it MUST update all tables in this
       MIB module that are indexed by indexes
       of type NeighborIfIndex.  It MAY then reuse freed
       index values following the next agent restart.

NeighborRouterIndex ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   DISPLAY-HINT "d"
   STATUS       current
   DESCRIPTION
      "An arbitrary, locally unique identifier associated with a
       virtual discovered neighbor (one or two hop).  Due to the
       nature of NHDP, the local router may identify
       multiple virtual neighbors that, in fact, are one and
       the same.  Neighbors that are two hops away with more than
       one advertised address will exhibit this behavior.  As the
       local router's knowledge of its neighbors' topology
       increases, the local router will be able to associate
       multiple virtual neighbor indexes into a single virtual
       neighbor index chosen from the set of aggregated indexes;
       it MUST update all tables in this MIB module indexed by these
       indexes, and it MAY reuse the freed indexes following the
       next agent re-initialization.

       All objects of type NeighborRouterIndex are assigned by
       the agent out of a common number space.

       The NeighborRouterIndex defines a discovered NHDP peer
       virtual neighbor of the local router.
       The value for each discovered virtual neighbor index MUST
       remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
       the entity's network management agent to the next
       re-initialization, except if an application is deleted
       and re-created.

       The specific value is meaningful only within a given SNMP
       entity.  A NeighborRouterIndex value MUST NOT be reused
       until the next agent restart."

         "The nhdpInterfaceTable describes the
          configuration of the interfaces of this router
          that are intended to use MANET control protocols.
          As such, this table 'sparse augments' the ifTable
          specifically when NHDP is to be configured to
          operate over this interface.  The interface is
          identified by the ifIndex from the Interfaces
          Group defined in the Interfaces Group MIB module.

          A conceptual row in this table exists if and only
          if the row has been administratively created
          or there is an interface on the managed device
          that supports and runs NHDP.

          A row can be administratively created by setting
          rowStatus to 'createAndGo' or 'createAndWait'.
          During the row creation, objects having associated
          DEFVAL clauses are automatically defined by
          the agent if not explicitly administratively defined.

          For each entry in the nhdpInterfaceTable, there is a
          corresponding entry in the Interface Table where
          nhdpIfIndex and ifIndex are equal.  If that corresponding
          entry in the Interface Table is deleted, then the entry in
          the nhdpInterfaceTable is automatically deleted,

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines objects for the configuration, monitoring,
   and notification of the Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood
   Discovery Protocol (NHDP) [RFC6130].  NHDP allows routers to acquire
   topological information up to two hops away by virtue of exchanging
   HELLO messages.  The information acquired by NHDP may be used by
   routing protocols.  The neighborhood information, exchanged between
   routers using NHDP, serves these routing protocols as a baseline for
   calculating paths to all destinations in the MANET, relay set
   selection for network-wide transmissions, etc.

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  nhdpIfStatus - This writable object turns on or off the NHDP
      process for the specified interface.  If disabled, higher-level
      protocol functions, e.g., routing, would fail, causing network-
      wide disruptions.

   o  nhdpHelloInterval, nhdpHelloMinInterval, and nhdpRefreshInterval -
      These writable objects control the rate at which HELLO messages
      are sent on an interface.  If set at too high a rate, this could
      represent a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack by overloading
      interface resources.

   o  nhdpHystAcceptQuality, nhdpHystRejectQuality, nhdpInitialQuality,
      and nhdpInitialPending - These writable objects affect the
      perceived quality of the NHDP links and hence the overall
      stability of the network.  If improperly set, these settings could
      result in network-wide disruptions.



Herberg, et al.              Standards Track                   [Page 66]

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


   o  nhdpInterfaceTable - This table contains writable objects that
      affect the overall performance and stability of the NHDP process.
      Failure of the NHDP process would result in network-wide failure.
      Particularly sensitive objects from this table are discussed in
      the previous list items.  This is the only table in the NHDP-MIB
      module with writable objects.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  nhdpDiscIfSetTable - The object contains information on discovered
      neighbors, specifically their IP address in the
      nhdpDiscIfSetIpAddr object.  This information provides an
      adversary broad information on the members of the MANET, located
      within this single table.  This information can be used to
      expedite attacks on the other members of the MANET without having
      to go through a laborious discovery process on their own.  This
      object is the index into the table and has a MAX-ACCESS of
      'not-accessible'.  However, this information can be exposed using
      SNMP operations.

   MANET technology is often deployed to support communications of
   emergency services or military tactical applications.  In these
   applications, it is imperative to maintain the proper operation of
   the communications network and to protect sensitive information
   related to its operation.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED to provide
   support for the Transport Security Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in
   combination with TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

RFC 7939                      The NHDP-MIB                   August 2016


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

9.  Applicability Statement

   This document describes objects for configuring parameters of the
   Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP)
   [RFC6130] process on a router.  This MIB module, denoted NHDP-MIB,
   also reports state, performance information, and notifications.  This
   section provides some examples of how this MIB module can be used in
   MANET network deployments.

   NHDP is designed to allow routers to automatically discover and track
   routers one hop remote (denoted "neighbors") and routers two hops
   remote (denoted "2-hop neighbors").  This information is used by
   other MANET protocols in operation on the router to perform routing,
   multicast forwarding, and other functions with ad hoc and mobile
   networks.  In the following, three example scenarios are listed where
   this MIB module is useful:

   o  For a Parking Lot Initial Configuration Situation - It is common
      for the vehicles comprising the MANET being forward deployed at a
      remote location, e.g., the site of a natural disaster, to be off-
      loaded in a parking lot where an initial configuration of the
      networking devices is performed.  The configuration is loaded into
      the devices from a fixed location Network Operations Center (NOC)
      at the parking lot, and the vehicles are stationary at the parking
      lot while the configuration changes are made.  Standards-based
      methods for configuration management from the co-located NOC are
      necessary for this deployment option.

   o  For Mobile Vehicles with Low-Bandwidth Satellite Link to a Fixed
      NOC - Here, the vehicles carrying the MANET routers carry multiple
      wireless interfaces, one of which is a relatively low-bandwidth,
      on-the-move satellite connection that interconnects a fix NOC to
      the nodes of the MANET.  Standards-based methods for monitoring
      and fault management from the fixed NOC are necessary for this
      deployment option.

   o  For Fixed NOC and Mobile Local Manager in Larger Vehicles - for
      larger vehicles, a hierarchical network management arrangement is
      useful.  Centralized network management is performed from a fixed
      NOC while local management is performed locally from within the

      vehicles.  Standards-based methods for configuration, monitoring,
      and fault management are necessary for this deployment option.
