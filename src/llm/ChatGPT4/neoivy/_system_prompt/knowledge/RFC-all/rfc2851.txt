Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent commonly
   used Internet network layer addressing information. The intent is
   that these definitions will be imported and used in MIBs that would
   otherwise define their own representations.

   This work is output from the Operations and Management Area "IPv6MIB"
   design team.

1. Introduction

   Several standard-track MIB modules use the IpAddress SMIv2 base type.
   This limits the applicability of these MIB modules to IP Version 4
   (IPv4) since the IpAddress SMIv2 base type can only contain 4 byte
   IPv4 addresses. The IpAddress SMIv2 base type has become problematic
   with the introduction of IP Version 6 (IPv6) addresses [21].

   This document defines multiple textual conventions as a mechanism to
   express generic Internet network layer addresses within MIB module
   specifications. The solution is compatible with SMIv2 (STD 58) and
   SMIv1 (STD 16). New MIB definitions which need to express network
   layer Internet addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions defined
   in this memo. New MIBs SHOULD NOT use the SMIv2 IpAddress base type
   anymore.

   A generic Internet address consists of two objects, one whose syntax
   is InetAddressType, and another whose syntax is InetAddress. The
   value of the first object determines how the value of the second
   object is encoded. The InetAddress textual convention represents an
   opaque Internet address value. The InetAddressType enumeration is
   used to "cast" the InetAddress value into a concrete textual
   convention for the address type. This usage of multiple textual
   conventions allows expression of the display characteristics of each
   address type and makes the set of defined Internet address types
   extensible.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can be used to
   define Internet addresses by using DNS domain names in addition to
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. A MIB designer can write compliance
   statements to express that only a subset of the possible address
   types must be supported by a compliant implementation.

   MIB developers who need to represent Internet addresses SHOULD use
   these definitions whenever applicable, as opposed to defining their
   own constructs. Even MIBs that only need to represent IPv4 or IPv6
   addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions defined in this memo.

   In order to make existing widely-deployed IPv4-only MIBs fit for
   IPv6, it might be a valid approach to define separate tables for
   different address types. This is a decision for the MIB designer.
   For example, the tcpConnTable of the TCP-MIB [18] was left intact




Daniele, et al.             Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 2851           TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2000


   and a new table was added for TCP connections over IPv6 in the IPV6-
   TCP-MIB [19]. Note that even in this case, the MIBs SHOULD use the
   textual conventions defined in this memo.

   Note that MIB developers SHOULD NOT use the textual conventions
   defined in this document to represent transport layer addresses.

   Instead the SMIv2 TAddress textual convention and associated
   definitions should be used for transport layer addresses.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].
   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5]. The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [6], STD 58, RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8].
   o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC
      1906 [11]. The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574
      [13].
   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [14].
   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [16].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

4. Usage Hints

   One particular usage of InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs is to avoid
   over-constraining an object definition by the use of the IpAddress
   SMI base type. An InetAddressType/InetAddress pair allows to
   represent IP addresses in various formats.

   The InetAddressType and InetAddress objects SHOULD NOT be subtyped.
   Subtyping binds the MIB module to specific address formats, which may
   cause serious problems if new address formats need to be introduced.
   Note that it is possible to write compliance statements in order to
   express that only a subset of the defined address types must be
   implemented to be compliant.

   Internet addresses MUST always be represented by a pair of
   InetAddressType/InetAddress objects. It is not allowed to "share" an
   InetAddressType between multiple InetAddress objects. Furthermore,
   the InetAddressType object must be registered immediately before the
   InetAddress object. In other words, the object identifiers for the
   InetAddressType object and the InetAddress object MUST have the same
   length and the last sub-identifier of the InetAddressType object MUST
   be 1 less than the last sub-identifier of the InetAddress object.

4.1 Table Indexing

   When a generic Internet address is used as an index, both the
   InetAddressType and InetAddress objects MUST be used. The
   InetAddressType object MUST come immediately before the InetAddress
   object in the INDEX clause. If multiple Internet addresses are used
   in the INDEX clause, then every Internet address must be represented
   by a pair of InetAddressType and InetAddress objects.

   The IMPLIED keyword MUST NOT be used for an object of type
   InetAddress in an INDEX clause. Instance sub-identifiers are then of
   the form T.N.O1.O2...On, where T is the value of the InetAddressType
   object, O1...On are the octets in the InetAddress object, and N is
   the number of those octets.

   There is a meaningful lexicographical ordering to tables indexed in
   this fashion. Command generator applications may lookup specific
   addresses of known type and value, issue GetNext requests for
   addresses of a single type, or issue GetNext requests for a specific
   type and address prefix.

RFC 2851           TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2000


4.2 Uniqueness of Addresses

   IPv4 addresses were intended to be globally unique, current usage
   notwithstanding. IPv6 addresses were architected to have different
   scopes and hence uniqueness [21]. In particular, IPv6 "link-local"
   and "site-local" addresses are not guaranteed to be unique on any
   particular node. In such cases, the duplicate addresses must be
   configured on different interfaces. So the combination of an IPv6
   address and an interface number is unique. The interface number may
   therefore be used as a scope identifier.

   The InetAddressIPv6 textual convention has been defined to represent
   global and non-global IPv6 addresses. MIB designers who use
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs therefore do not need define
   additional objects in order to support link-local or site-local
   addresses.

   The size of the scope identifier has been chosen so that it matches
   the sin6_scope_id field of the sockaddr_in6 structure defined in RFC
   2553 [22].

4.3 Multiple InetAddresses per Host

   A single host system may be configured with multiple addresses (IPv4
   or IPv6), and possibly with multiple DNS names. Thus it is possible
   for a single host system to be represented by multiple
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs.

   If this could be an implementation or usage issue, then the
   DESCRIPTION clause of the relevant objects MUST fully describe
   required behavior.

4.4 Resolving DNS Names

   DNS names must be resolved to IP addresses when communication with
   the named host is required. This raises a temporal aspect to defining
   MIB objects whose value is a DNS name: When is the name translated to
   an address?

   For example, consider an object defined to indicate a forwarding
   destination, and whose value is a DNS name. When does the forwarding
   entity resolve the DNS name? Each time forwarding occurs? Once, when
   the object was instantiated?

   The DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely define how
   and when any required name to address resolution is done.

RFC 2851           TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2000


   Similarly, the DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely
   define how and when a reverse lookup is being done if an agent has
   accessed instrumentation that knows about an IP address and the MIB
   or implementation requires to map the address to a name.

5. Table Indexing Example

   This example shows a table listing communication peers that are
   identified by either an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or a DNS name.
   The table definition also prohibits entries with an empty address
   (whose type would be "unknown"). The size of a DNS name is limited to
   64 characters.

RFC 2851           TCs for Internet Network Addresses          June 2000


     DESCRIPTION
         "The Internet address for the peer. Note that
          implementations must limit themselves to a single
          entry in this table per reachable peer.

          The peerAddress may not be empty due to the SIZE
          restriction.

          If a row is created administratively by an SNMP
          operation and the address type value is dns(16), then
          the agent stores the DNS name internally. A DNS name
          lookup must be performed on the internally stored DNS
          name whenever it is being used to contact the peer.
          If a row is created by the managed entity itself and
          the address type value is dns(16), then the agent
          stores the IP address internally. A DNS reverse lookup
          must be performed on the internally stored IP address
          whenever the value is retrieved via SNMP."
     ::= { peerEntry 2 }

   The following compliance statement specifies that implementations
   need only support IPv4 addresses and globally unique IPv6 addresses
   to be compliant. Support for DNS names or scoped IPv6 addresses is
   not required.

   peerCompliance MODULE-COMPLIANCE
     STATUS      current
     DESCRIPTION
         "The compliance statement the peer MIB."

     MODULE      -- this module
     MANDATORY-GROUPS    { peerGroup }

     OBJECT  peerAddressType
     SYNTAX  InetAddressType { ipv4(1), ipv6(2) }
     DESCRIPTION
         "An implementation is only required to support IPv4
          and IPv6 addresses."

     OBJECT  peerAddress
     SYNTAX  InetAddress (SIZE(4|16))
     DESCRIPTION
         "An implementation is only required to support IPv4
          and globally unique IPv6 addresses."

     ::= { somewhere 2 }

   Note that the SMIv2 does not permit inclusion of not-accessible
   objects in an object group (see section 3.1 in STD 58, RFC 2580 [8]).
   It is therefore not possible to formally refine the syntax of
   auxiliary objects which are not-accessible.  In such a case, it is
   suggested to express the refinement informally in the DESCRIPTION
   clause of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro invocation.

6. Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects. Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the modules
   that define management objects.

7. Acknowledgments

   The authors would like to thank Randy Bush, Richard Draves, Mark
   Ellison, Bill Fenner, Jun-ichiro Hagino, Tim Jenkins, Glenn
   Mansfield, Keith McCloghrie, Thomas Narten, Erik Nordmark, Peder Chr.
   Norgaard, Randy Presuhn, Andrew Smith, Dave Thaler, Kenneth White,
   Bert Wijnen, and Brian Zill for their comments and suggestions.
