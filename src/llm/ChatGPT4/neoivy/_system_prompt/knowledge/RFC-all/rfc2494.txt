Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing DS0 and DS0
   Bundle interfaces.  This document is a companion document with
   Definitions of Managed Objects for the DS1/E1/DS2/E2 (RFC 2495 [17]),
   DS3/E3 (RFC 2496 [18]), and the work in progress, SONET/SDH Interface
   Types.

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC
        1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and
        RFC 2274 [12].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information
        store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects
        in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.



Fowler, Ed.                 Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 2494                DSO MIB / DSOBUNDLE MIB             January 1999


        This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.
        A MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the
        appropriate translations. The resulting translated MIB must be
        semantically equivalent, except where objects or events are
        omitted because no translation is possible (use of Counter64).
        Some machine readable information in SMIv2 will be converted
        into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
        process. However, this loss of machine readable information is
        not considered to change the semantics of the MIB.

2.  Overview

   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is a DS0 interface.  At present, this applies to
   these values of the ifType variable in the Internet-standard MIB:

        ds0 (81)
        ds0Bundle (82)

2.1.  BONDing Terminology

   Please reference The BONDing Spec [20] for definitions of terms used
   to describe bonding modes.

2.2.  Use of ifTable for DS0 Layer

   The following items are defined in RFC 2233 [16].

   Only the ifGeneralInformationGroup and ifCounterDiscontinuityGroup
   need to be supported.

              ifTable Object           Use for DS0 Layer
   ======================================================================
              ifIndex                  Interface index.

              ifDescr                  See interfaces MIB [16].

              ifType                   ds0(81) or ds0Bundle(82).

              ifSpeed                  64000 for ds0 (regardless of the
                                       setting of robbed bit signalling)
                                       or N*64000 for ds0Bundle.

              ifPhysAddress            The value of the Circuit
                                       Identifier.  If no Circuit
                                       Identifier has been assigned
                                       this object should have an octet
                                       string with zero length.

              ifName                   See interfaces MIB [16].

              ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable   Set to disabled(2).
                                       Supports read-only access.

              ifHighSpeed              Set to rounded ifSpeed/1000000.

              ifConnectorPresent       Set to false(2).

2.3.  Using ifStackTable

   This section describes by example how to use ifStackTable to
   represent the relationship of ds0 and ds0Bundles with ds1 interfaces.
   Implementors of the stack table for ds0 and ds0Bundle interfaces
   should look at the appropriate RFC for the service being stacked on
   ds0s and ds0Bundles.  Examples given below are for illustration
   purposes only.

   Example: A Frame Relay Service is being carried on 4 ds0s of a ds1.

           +---------------------+
           | Frame Relay Service |
           +---------------------+
                      |
           +---------------------+
           | ds0Bundle           |
           +---------------------+
             |     |     |     |
           +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
           |ds0| |ds0| |ds0| |ds0|
           +---+ +---+ +---+ +---+
             |     |     |     |
           +---------------------+
           | ds1                 |
           +---------------------+

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

           ifIndex  Description
           1        FrameRelayService (type 44)
           2        ds0Bundle         (type 82)
           3        ds0 #1            (type 81)



Fowler, Ed.                 Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2494                DSO MIB / DSOBUNDLE MIB             January 1999


           4        ds0 #2            (type 81)
           5        ds0 #3            (type 81)
           6        ds0 #4            (type 81)
           7        ds1               (type 18)

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various interfaces.

           ifStackTable Entries

           HigherLayer   LowerLayer
           0             1
           1             2
           2             3
           2             4
           2             5
           2             6
           3             7
           4             7
           5             7
           6             7
           7             0


   In the case where the frameRelayService is using a single ds0, then
   the ds0Bundle is not required.

           +---------------------+
           | Frame Relay Service |
           +---------------------+
             |
           +---+
           |ds0|
           +---+
             |
           +---------------------+
           | ds1                 |
           +---------------------+

   The assignment of the index values could for example be:

           ifIndex  Description
           1        FrameRelayService (type 44)
           2        ds0               (type 81)
           3        ds1               (type 18)

   The ifStackTable is then used to show the relationships between the
   various interfaces.

           3             0

2.3.1.  Usage of Channelization for DS3, DS1, DS0

   An example is given here to explain the channelization objects in the
   DS3, DS1, and DS0 MIBs to help the implementor use the objects
   correctly.  Treatment of E3 and E1 would be similar, with the number
   of DS0s being different depending on the framing of the E1.  Timeslot
   16 is not created for framing types that do not pass data over it.

   Assume that a DS3 (with ifIndex 1) is channelized into DS1s (without
   DS2s).  The object dsx3Channelization is set to enabledDs1.  There
   will be 28 DS1s in the ifTable.  Assume the entries in the ifTable
   for the DS1s are created in channel order and the ifIndex values are
   2 through 29.  In the DS1 MIB, there will be an entry in the
   dsx1ChanMappingTable for each ds1.  The entries will be as follows:

           dsx1ChanMappingTable Entries

           ifIndex  dsx1Ds1ChannelNumber   dsx1ChanMappedIfIndex
           1        1                      2
           1        2                      3
           ......
           1        28                     29

   In addition, the DS1s are channelized into DS0s.  The object
   dsx1Channelization is set to enabledDs0 for each DS1.  When this
   object is set to this value, 24 DS0s are created by the agent. There
   will be 24 DS0s in the ifTable for each DS1.  If the
   dsx1Channelization is set to disabled, the 24 DS0s are destroyed.

   Assume the entries in the ifTable are created in channel order and
   the ifIndex values for the DS0s in the first DS1 are 30 through 53.
   In the DS0 MIB, there will be an entry in the dsx0ChanMappingTable
   for each DS0.  The entries will be as follows:

RFC 2494                DSO MIB / DSOBUNDLE MIB             January 1999


           dsx0ChanMappingTable Entries

           ifIndex   dsx0Ds0ChannelNumber  dsx0ChanMappedIfIndex
           2         1                     30
           2         2                     31
           ......
           2         24                    53

2.3.2.  Usage of ifIndex Mapping for DS0Bundle

   An example is given here to explain the ifIndex mapping objects in
   the DS0Bundle MIB to help the implementor use the objects correctly.

   Assume that a DS1 (with ifIndex 1) is channelized into DS0s.  There
   will be 24 DS0s in the ifTable.  Assume the entries in the ifTable
   for the DS0s are created in channel order and the ifIndex values are
   2 through 25.  Now, assume that there are two bundles on the DS1.
   The first one uses channels 1 and 2.  The second uses channels 3 and
   4.  There will be two ifTable entries for these bundles, with values
   of 26 and 27 for ifIndex.  There will be an entry in the
   dsx0BundleTable for each bundle.  The entries will be as follows:

           dsx0BundleTable Entries

           dsx0BundleIndex    dsx0BundleIfIndex
           1                  26
           2                  27

   There will be an entry in the dsx0ConfigTable for each DS0.  The
   entries will be as follows:

           dsx0ConfigTable Entries

           ifIndex  dsx0Ds0ChannelNumber   dsx0Ds0BundleMappedIfIndex
           2        1                      26
           3        2                      26
           4        3                      27
           5        4                      27
           6        5                      0
           7        6                      0
           ......
           25       24                     0

3.  Overview of the MIB

   This document contains 2 MIB modules, the DS0 MIB and the DS0Bundle
   MIB.

RFC 2494                DSO MIB / DSOBUNDLE MIB             January 1999


3.1.  DS0 MIB

   The DS0 MIB is used to represent individual DS0s in a DS1 or E1.
   Variables in this MIB would be created for each DS0 in the ifTable.
   This MIB contains the following group:

   The DS0 Config Group - This group contains configuration information
   about a particular DS0.

3.2.  DS0Bundle MIB

   The DS0Bundle MIB is used to represent collections of DS0s that are
   used together to carry data within a DS1/E1 at speeds greater than
   that of a single DS0.  DS0Bundles are created on top of DS0s and are
   represented that way in the ifStackTable.  This MIB contains the
   following groups:

   The DS0 Bundle Group - This group contains objects used for creating
   new ds0Bundles.  This group is mandatory.

   The DS0 Bonding Group - This group contains information about bonding
   for a ds0Bundle, if bonding is enabled.  This group is optional.

               and number exchange with no synchronization.  Mode
               1 provides parameter and number exchange.  Mode 1
               also provides synchronization during
               initialization but does not include inband
               monitoring.  Mode 2 provides all of the above plus
               inband monitoring.  Mode 2 also steals 1/64th of
               the bandwidth of each channel (thus not supporting
               n x 56/64 kbit/s data channels for most values of
               n). Mode 3 provides all of the above, but also
               provides n x 56/64 kbit/s data channels.  Most
               common implementations of Mode 3 add an extra
               channel to support the inband monitoring overhead.
               ModeNone should be used when the interface is not
               performing bandwidth-on-demand."

9.  Security Considerations

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET (read) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [12] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [15] is recommended.





Fowler, Ed.                 Standards Track                    [Page 23]

RFC 2494                DSO MIB / DSOBUNDLE MIB             January 1999


   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to those objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to access them.

   Setting the following objects to an inappropriate value can cause
   loss of traffic.  In the case of dsx0RobbedBitSignalling, for
   example, the nature of the traffic flowing on the DS0 can be
   affected.
      dsx0RobbedBitSignalling
      dsx0IdleCode
      dsx0SeizedCode
      dsx0TransmitCodesEnable
      dsx0BundleRowStatus
      dsx0BondMode
      dsx0BondRowStatus

   Setting the following objects is mischievous, but not harmful to
   traffic.
      dsx0CircuitIdentifier
      dsx0BundleNextIndex
