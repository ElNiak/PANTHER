1.  Introduction

1.1.  Discard Count Report Block

   This document defines a new block type to augment those defined in
   [RFC3611] for use in a range of RTP applications.  The new block type
   supports the reporting of the number of packets that are received
   correctly but are never played out, typically because they arrive too
   late (buffer underflow) or too early (buffer overflow) to be played
   out.  The metric is applicable both to systems that use packet loss
   repair techniques (such as forward error correction [RFC5109] or
   retransmission [RFC4588]) and to those that do not.

   This metric is useful for identifying the existence, and
   characterizing the severity, of packet transport problems that may
   affect users' perceptions of a service delivered over RTP.

   This block may be used in conjunction with [RFC7003], which provides
   additional information on the pattern of discarded packets.  However,
   the metric in [RFC7003] may be used independently of the metrics in
   this block.




Clark, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 2]

RFC 7002                     RTCP XR Discard              September 2013


   When a Discard Count Metrics Block is sent together with a Burst/Gap
   Discard Metrics Block (defined in [RFC7003]) to the media sender or
   RTP-based network management system, the information carried in the
   Discard Count Metrics Block and the Burst/Gap Discard Metrics Block
   allows systems receiving the blocks to calculate burst/gap summary
   statistics (e.g., the gap discard rate).

   The metric belongs to the class of transport-related end-system
   metrics defined in [RFC6792].

1.2.  RTCP and RTCP Extended Reports

   The use of RTCP for reporting is defined in [RFC3550].  [RFC3611]
   defined an extensible structure for reporting using an RTCP Extended
   Report (XR).  This document defines a new Extended Report block for
   use with [RFC3550] and [RFC3611].

1.3.  Performance Metrics Framework

   "Guidelines for Considering New Performance Metric Development"
   [RFC6390] provides guidance on the definition and specification of
   performance metrics.  "Guidelines for Use of the RTP Monitoring
   Framework" [RFC6792] provides guidance for reporting block format
   using RTCP XR.  The metrics block described in this document is in
   accordance with the guidelines in [RFC6390] and [RFC6792].

1.4.  Applicability

   This metric is believed to be applicable to a large class of RTP
   applications that use a de-jitter buffer [RFC5481].

   Discards due to late or early arriving packets affect user
   experience.  The reporting of discards alerts senders and other
   receivers to the need to adjust their transmission or reception
   strategies.  The reports allow network managers to diagnose these
   user experience problems.

   The ability to detect duplicate packets can be used by managers to
   detect network layer or sender behavior, which may indicate network
   or device issues.  Based on the reports, these issues may be
   addressed prior to any impact on user experience.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

RFC 7002                     RTCP XR Discard              September 2013


   In addition, the following terms are defined:

   Received, Lost, and Discarded

      A packet shall be regarded as lost if it fails to arrive within an
      implementation-specific time window.  A packet that arrives within
      this time window but is either too early or too late to be played
      out or is thrown away before playout due to packet duplication or
      redundancy shall be regarded as discarded.  A packet shall not be
      regarded as discarded if it arrives within this time window but is
      dropped during decoding by some higher layer decoder, e.g., due to
      a decoding error.  A packet shall be classified as one of the
      following: received (or OK), discarded, or lost.  The discard
      count metric counts only discarded packets.  The metric
      "cumulative number of packets lost" defined in [RFC3550] reports a
      count of packets lost from the media stream (single
      synchronization source (SSRC) within a single RTP session).
      Similarly, the metric "number of packets discarded" reports a
      count of packets discarded from the media stream (single SSRC
      within a single RTP session) arriving at the receiver.  Another
      metric defined in [RFC5725] is available to report on packets that
      are not recovered by any repair techniques that may be in use.

3.  Discard Count Metrics Block

   Metrics in this block report on the number of packets discarded in
   the stream arriving at the RTP end system.  The measurement of these
   metrics is made at the receiving end of the RTP stream.  Instances of
   this metrics block use the SSRC to refer to the separate auxiliary
   Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], which describes measurement
   periods in use (see [RFC6776], Section 4.2).  This metrics block
   relies on the measurement interval in the Measurement Information
   Block indicating the span of the report and MUST be sent in the same
   compound RTCP packet as the Measurement Information Block.  If the
   measurement interval is not received in the same compound RTCP packet
   as this metrics block, this metrics block MUST be discarded.

3.1.  Report Block Structure

   The structure of the Discard Count Metrics Block is as follows.

3.2.  Definition of Fields in the Discard Count Metrics Block

   Block Type (BT): 8 bits

      A Discard Count Metrics Block is identified by the constant 24.

   Interval Metric flag (I): 2 bits

      This field indicates whether the reported metric is an Interval,
      Cumulative, or Sampled metric [RFC6792]:

         I=10: Interval Duration - the reported value applies to the
         most recent measurement interval duration between successive
         metrics reports.

         I=11: Cumulative Duration - the reported value applies to the
         accumulation period characteristic of cumulative measurements.

         I=01: Sampled Value - the reported value is a sampled
         instantaneous value.

      In this document, the discard count metric can only be measured
      over definite intervals and cannot be sampled.  Accordingly, the
      value I=01, indicating a sampled value, MUST NOT be sent, and MUST
      be discarded when received.  In addition, the value I=00 is
      reserved and also MUST NOT be sent, and MUST be discarded when
      received.

RFC 7002                     RTCP XR Discard              September 2013


   Discard Type (DT): 2 bits

      This field is used to identify the discard type used in this
      report block.  The discard type is defined as follows:

         00: Report packet discarded or being thrown away before playout
         due to packet duplication.

         01: Report packet discarded due to too early to be played out.

         10: Report packet discarded due to too late to be played out.

      The value DT=11 is reserved for future definition and MUST NOT be
      sent, and MUST be discarded when received.

      An endpoint MAY report any combination of discard types in each
      reporting interval by including several Discard Count Metrics
      Blocks in a single RTCP XR packet.

      Some systems send duplicate RTP packets for robustness or error
      resilience.  This is NOT RECOMMENDED since it breaks RTCP packet
      statistics.  If duplication is desired for error resilience, the
      mechanism described in [RTPDUP] can be used, since this will not
      cause breakage of RTP streams or RTCP statistics.

   Reserved (resv): 4 bits

      These bits are reserved.  They MUST be set to zero by senders and
      ignored by receivers (see [RFC6709], Section 4.2).

   Block Length: 16 bits

      The length of this report block in 32-bit words, minus one, in
      accordance with the definition in [RFC3611].  This field MUST be
      set to 2 to match the fixed length of the report block.  The block
      MUST be discarded if the block length is set to a different value.

   SSRC of Source: 32 bits

      As defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC3611].

RFC 7002                     RTCP XR Discard              September 2013


   Discard Count

      Number of packets discarded over the period (Interval or
      Cumulative) covered by this report.

      The measured value is an unsigned value.  If the measured value
      exceeds 0xFFFFFFFD, the value 0xFFFFFFFE MUST be reported to
      indicate an over-range measurement.  If the measurement is
      unavailable, the value 0xFFFFFFFF MUST be reported.

      Note that the number of packets expected in the period associated
      with this metric (whether Interval or Cumulative) is available
      from the difference between a pair of extended sequence numbers in
      the Measurement Information Block [RFC6776], so it need not be
      repeated in this block.

4.  SDP Signaling

   [RFC3611] defines the use of the Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   [RFC4566] for signaling the use of XR blocks.  However, XR blocks MAY
   be used without prior signaling (see Section 5 of RFC 3611).

4.1.  SDP rtcp-xr Attribute Extension

   This section augments the SDP [RFC4566] attribute "rtcp-xr" defined
   in [RFC3611] by providing an additional value of "xr-format" to
   signal the use of the report block defined in this document.  The
   ABNF [RFC5234] syntax is as follows.

   xr-format =/ xr-pdc-block
   xr-pdc-block = "pkt-discard-count"


4.2.  Offer/Answer Usage

   When SDP is used in Offer/Answer context, the SDP Offer/Answer usage
   defined in [RFC3611] for unilateral "rtcp-xr" attribute parameters
   applies.  For detailed usage of Offer/Answer for unilateral
   parameters, refer to Section 5.2 of [RFC3611].

5.  IANA Considerations

   New block types for RTCP XR are subject to IANA registration.  For
   general guidelines on IANA considerations for RTCP XR, refer to
   [RFC3611].

RFC 7002                     RTCP XR Discard              September 2013


5.1.  New RTCP XR Block Type Value

   This document assigns the block type value 24 in the IANA "RTP
   Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Block Type Registry" to
   the "Discard Count Metrics Block".

5.2.  New RTCP XR SDP Parameter

   This document also registers a new parameter "pkt-discard-count" in
   the "RTP Control Protocol Extended Reports (RTCP XR) Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters Registry".

5.3.  Contact Information for Registrations

   The following contact information is provided for all registrations
   in this document:

6.  Security Considerations

   In some situations, returning very detailed error information (e.g.,
   over-range measurement or measurement unavailable) using this report
   block can provide an attacker with insight into the security
   processing.  Where this is a concern, the implementation should apply
   encryption and authentication to this report block.  For example,
   this can be achieved by using the Audio-Visual Profile with Feedback
   (AVPF) profile together with the Secure RTP profile, as defined in
   [RFC3711]; an appropriate combination of those two profiles ("SAVPF")
   is specified in [RFC5124].

   Besides this, it is believed that this RTCP XR block introduces no
   new security considerations beyond those described in [RFC3611].
   This block does not provide per-packet statistics, so the risk to
   confidentiality documented in Section 7, paragraph 3 of [RFC3611]
   does not apply.
