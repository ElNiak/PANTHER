                     Introducing Project Long Bud:
      Internet Pilot Project for the Deployment of X.500 Directory
                Information in Support of X.400 Routing

Status of this Memo

   This memo provides information for the Internet community.  This memo
   does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.  Distribution of
   this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   The Internet X.400 community (i.e., GO-MHS) currently lacks a
   distributed mechanism providing dynamic updating and management of
   message routing information.  The IETF MHS-DS Working Group has
   specified an approach for X.400 Message Handling Systems to perform
   message routing using OSI Directory Services.  The MHS-DS approach
   has been successfully tested in a number of local environments.

   This memo describes a proposed Internet Pilot Project that seeks to
   prove the MHS-DS approach on a larger scale.  The results of this
   pilot will then be used to draw up recommendations for a global
   deployment.

1. Background

   The 1988 edition of X.400 introduces, among other extensions or
   revisions, the concept of O/R Names which assumes the existence of a
   widely available Directory Service.  This Directory Service is needed
   to support several MHS operations (support for names to identify
   senders and receivers of messages in a user-friendly fashion, support
   for distribution lists, authentication of MHS components, description
   of MHS components capabilities...).

   The prime advantage of Directory Names, as perceived by many users,
   was to release users from the remembering of complex O/R Addresses
   for their correspondents.

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


   In the MHS infrastructure, as compared to other protocols, a name by
   itself does not contain enough information to allow the Message
   Transfer Agents (MTAs) to route a message to the User Agent (UA)
   servicing this name.  The routing process is based on information
   provided by different MHS Management Domains, whether they are public
   or private.

   An MHS community combines several administrative MHS domains among
   which agreements for cooperative routing exist:  the GO-MHS community
   is the set of MTA's taking care of X.400 mail operations on the
   Internet [RFC 1649].

   In the absence of a distributed Directory Service, an interim
   technique has been developed within the GO-MHS community to collect
   and advertise routing information.  This resulted in an experimental
   IETF protocol [RFC 1465].

2. Rationale

   A number of routing problems are preventing the present Internet
   X.400 service from expanding its number of participating message
   transfer agents to a global scale.  The two most critical problems
   are:

      * The present mechanism of centrally maintained and advertized
        MTA routing tables has been optimized as far as possible.
        Increasing the number of directly connected MTAs increases also
        the workload on the MHS managers.  The current solution does
        not scale.  Routing must be a fully dynamic and distributed
        process.

      * Manual propagation and installation of routing tables do not
        guarantee consistency of routing information (even in a loose
        fashion) when it is accessed by different MTAs scattered across
        the globe.

   It is commonly accepted that a distributed mechanism providing for
   dynamic updating and management of X.400 routing information is
   highly desirable.  The focus of the project is to establish X.500-
   based support of X.400 routing, at a very large scale.

3. Benefits

   Using the Directory as a dynamic means of information storage and
   advertisement will guarantee participants in Project Long Bud that
   their updated data are globally available to the community.  As a
   direct consequence of the above, a participating MHS manager will be
   released from configuring connections to the other participants.



Alvestrand, et al            Informational                      [Page 2]

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


   Directory-capable MTAs will be able to discover more optimal and more
   direct routes to X.400 destinations than are practical today.  This
   will enable faster delivery of messages.

   The infrastructure reliability will be improved:  the information
   stored in the Directory will allow automatic use of backup
   connections in case of remote MTA or network problems.  X.400 mail
   managers in the GO-MHS Community should then be released from the
   need to know the complexity of the whole mail routing infrastructure.
   Providing a dynamic routing infrastructure will eliminate
   inconsistencies introduced by unsynchronized static tables and
   improve quality of service.

   Furthermore, besides the robustness and the optimization of the new
   routing infrastructure, the Long Bud approach should bring to the
   participating organizations better control over how they establish
   and maintain their interconnection with the GO-MHS community.

   Participants will share in building an X.400 network which can expand
   to a very large scale.  They will develop experience using a global
   messaging architecture which scales well and requires minimal
   administrative overhead.  They will be able to discuss experience
   with the MHS-DS experts and architects in the ongoing standards
   development cycle.

4. Definition of project LONG BUD

   The Long Bud pilot wishes to demonstrate that the X.500 Directory is
   able to provide a global-scale service to messaging applications.

   Although MHS-DS provides ways to use private routing trees, Long Bud
   will focus on the Open Community Routing Tree as used by the GO-MHS
   community.

4.1 Project Goals

   Project Long Bud has the following goals:

   * Gather pilot experience of the defined framework for X.500
     support of MTA routing, as defined by the IETF MHS-DS Working
     Group [Kille 94].

   * Actively investigate migration of the existing operational
     X.400 service from a routing method based upon distribution of
     centrally maintained static tables, as specified in [RFC 1465],
     to a method based instead upon X.500:





Alvestrand, et al            Informational                      [Page 3]

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


       -- Deploy X.400 MTAs which are directly capable of reading
          routing information from the X.500 Directory, in
          compliance with the specifications of the MHS-DS Working
          Group.  This type of MTA is called a directory-capable
          MTA.

       -- Deploy tools which read routing information from the X.500
          Directory and use it to generate static routing tables for
          MTAs which are not directory-capable.

   * specify a set of minimal operational requirements needed before
     X.500-based routing of X.400 messages can be widely deployed.

4.2 Phasing

   The first phase of Project Long Bud consists in deploying a small
   number of directory-capable MTAs operated by members of the MHS-DS
   Working Group and GO-MHS community.  These MTAs must be capable of
   using information in the X.500 directory to route messages to all
   other members of the project as well as to the existing GO-MHS
   community.  As of this writing, an initial set of MTAs is already
   operational.

   At the end of this phase, the following goals should be achieved:

   * The X.500 DIT must be populated with enough routing information
     to allow the participating MTAs to route reliably messages to
     each other and to the existing GO-MHS community.

   * The X.500 DSAs holding the routing information must operate at
     a quality of service that is acceptable for an operational
     X.400 service.

   As a prerequisite, a sufficient number of MTA managers must be
   willing to participate in Project Long Bud for the first set of
   results to be significant.  Support for a protocol stack conforming
   to [RFC 1006] is mandatory.  All MTAs participating in the Long Bud
   pilot need to register in the Open Tree and must be prepared to
   accept connections from anyone.

   Note that in the first phase, default routes will be established in
   the DIT such that messages addressed to destinations outside of the
   Long Bud community will be routed to designated MTAs in the GO-MHS
   community.  This will allow for full connectivity between the Long
   Bud community and the GO-MHS community which are related, but
   distinct communities.  Interworking between these two must be
   established and coordinated.




Alvestrand, et al            Informational                      [Page 4]

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


   In the second phase of Project Long Bud, a greater number of MTAs
   should be added to the experiment.  Cooperation with non directory-
   capable communities must be addressed.

4.3 General Approach

   No large scale resources have been committed to this project.  Yet,
   expedient deployment is desirable.  Therefore, the pilot project
   needs to be focused and relatively short-lived.  The general approach
   for satisfying these requirements includes:

   * Use as many existing MHS-DS tools as possible.  Also, continue
     to track the progress of tools being developed by project
     members and facilitate their deployment as soon as they are
     ready.

   * Coordinate efforts with existing GO-MHS community service.

   * Establish a core infrastructure:  4 DSAs (two in the United
     States and two in Europe) are set up to serve MHS-DS
     information.

   * Wherever it is technically feasable, DSA managers will
     establish bilateral agreements with one (or more) of the core
     DSAs in order to duplicate their routing information.  For
     example, the core DSAs support the replication protocol
     specified in [RFC 1275] as a duplication technique.

   * the Long Bud pilot needs to cooperate actively with DANTE
     NameFlow (the continuation of the PARADISE Pilot) and other
     directory providers in order to promote stability and
     consistency of informations.

4.4 Tools Needed

   To facilitate widespread deployment of MHS-DS routing technology and
   to foster interworking between directory-capable MTAs and MTAs which
   are not directory-capable, tools providing the following
   functionalities need to be developed:

   populate the Directory with routing information:  such a tool must
        accept routing information specified in the standard syntax
        used by the GO-MHS community (see [RFC 1465]) as input, and it
        will load or update entries which convey the same information
        in the X.500 Directory.






Alvestrand, et al            Informational                      [Page 5]

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


   downloading of routing information from the Directory:  in order to
        provide a migration path for organizations not using
        directory-capable MTAs, a tool is needed which will read X.400
        routing information from the X.500 Directory and generate
        static routing information from it.  The syntax of the static
        information generated will conform to the syntax defined by the
        GO-MHS community, so that "classical" MTAs run as they
        currently do.

   displaying route taken by a message between two end-points:  this
        tool should accept two parameters as input:  the X.500
        distinguished name of an MTA, and an X.400 O/R name.  It will
        display the possible routes which may be taken in order to
        deliver a message from the specified MTA to the specified X.400
        destination.  This tool looks very much the same as the
        traceroute facility used at the IP level.

   These tools must use standard protocols to access the Directory (such
   as DAP [CCITT 88] or LDAP [RFC 1487]).  Portability is encouraged.

   A note on quality

   Pilot use of this Directory information depends heavily on data
   quality and availability.  Although the administration of DSA
   availability and global Directory data accuracy are not in the scope
   of Long Bud, care must be taken that Directory resources used by Long
   Bud participants are administrated well.

   If they have the technical ability to do so, Long Bud participants
   are encouraged to replicate routing information in their Directory to
   improve data availability.

   Directory data used by the pilot must be accurate:  solutions to this
   problem will be recommanded as the project matures.

5. Participation Guide

   The existing operational X.400 service, the GO-MHS service, uses the
   following method to distribute and manage X.400 routing information:
   A group of MTAs is organized into a routing community.  The community
   keeps its routing information up to date by assigning to each MTA
   manager the responsibility of determining the routing information for
   his/her MTA, formalizing this routing information in the syntax
   defined by the community and sending the result to the GO-MHS
   coordination service.  Once the information has been validated
   against the other data provided by all managers in the community, the
   coordination service will advertise it to the whole community.  Each
   manager will then have to update his/her MTA configuration with the

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


   verified information.

   The purpose of Project Long Bud is to allow a manager to operate an
   MTA without having to perform ANY manual steps when another MTA
   manager adds new or changes existing routing information.  This will
   facilitate efficient, dynamic, and manageable interconnection of very
   large communities of MTAs.  It will allow the Internet X.400
   community to overcome the limitations in scalability which it is
   currently encountering.

5.1 Prerequisites for participation

   The prerequisites for joining Project Long Bud are:

   Step 1:  Participants in the pilot must have a good knowledge of
            the IETF MHS-DS Working Group activities and documents:

          1. Participants must join the MHS-DS distribution list:

                   RFC-822:  mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com

                     X.400:  PN=mhs-ds; OU=mercury; OU=OSS;
                             OU=ARH; O=CPG; P=CDC; A=ATTMail; C=US

             Requests to join the MHS-DS distribution list may be sent
             to the following email address:

                  RFC-822:  mhs-ds-request@mercury.udev.cdc.com

                    X.400:  PN=mhs-ds-request; OU=mercury; OU=OSS;
                            OU=ARH; O=CPG; P=CDC; A=ATTMail; C=US


          2. Participants must retrieve and become familiar with all
             relevant tools and documents stored on the Project Long
             Bud anonymous FTP server

                           Host name:  ftp.css.cdc.com

                           Directory:  pub/mhs-ds/long-bud

             In particular, openly available software related to Long
             Bud activities will be kept up-to-date at this location.

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


          3. If not already done, participants must do one of the
             following:

               * Upgrade their X.400 and X.500 software such that it
                 supports the MHS-DS specifications as in [Kille 94].

               * Use the tools which extract MHS-DS information from
                 the directory and generate whatever local
                 configuration files are necessary to allow local MTA's
                 to use the information.  This should be done
                 frequently (at least once per day).

   Step 2:  Participants must register required entries in the
            Directory so that their MTA(s) is (are) known to the
            Directory.

          1. Arrange with the appropriate DSA Manager (who can be a
             local manager if the DSA is run by the participating
             organization, or a manager who is in charge of running the
             organization's DSA) to create an entry for the local
             MTA(s) involved in the pilot.  At this stage, only
             connection information is required.

          2. Check, test and verify the connection information with at
             least one other participant.  The mhs-ds distribution list
             should be used for announcing the new registration and
             asking volunteers for testing.

          3. Participants must establish sensible default X.400 routes
             to existing GO-MHS destinations for which X.500-based
             routing information will not exist initially.

   Step 3:  Participants can then enter their routing information in
            the Directory.

          1. Before any routing is entered in the DIT, participants
             must check with the GO-MHS Coordination Service that the
             routes they want to register can be properly handled by
             the GO-MHS community (contact information is
             mailflow@mailflow.dante.net).  It is crucial for the Pilot
             that any routing information entered in the Directory is
             kept carefully accurate if the experiment is to be
             meaningful.  Participants may also consider the need for
             mapping rules (see [RFC 1465] for details).

          2. Once the above step is validated by the GO-MHS
             Coordination Service, participants must record routing
             information for their MTA(s) in the Internet X.500



Alvestrand, et al            Informational                      [Page 8]

RFC 1802              Introducing Project Long Bud             June 1995


             directory service.  This requires that a participant does
             the following:

               * Arrange with the appropriate DSA Manager (who can be
                 either a local manager if the DSA is run by the
                 participating organization or a manager which is in
                 charge of running the organization's DSA) to enter
                 X.400 routing information in a routing tree held by
                 the participating organization.  This routing tree
                 should contain all necessary information for the local
                 mail domain.

               * Check, test and verify the registered routing
                 information with at least one other participant.  The
                 mhs-ds distribution list should be used for announcing
                 the new registration and asking volunteers for
                 testing.

          3. If a participant adds new nonleaf entries to the Open
             Community Routing Tree, then s/he must find at least one
             other participant who will maintain a slave copy of the
             children of the nonleaf entry.  Send email to the mhs-ds
             distribution list in order to find a partner who is
             willing to do this.

          4. If a participant adds new nonleaf ADMD or PRMD entries to
             the directory, then s/he must contact the managers of the
             Long Bud core DSA's and arrange to provide slave copies of
             the children of the ADMD and/or PRMD entries to all of the
             core DSA's.  Send email to the mhs-ds distribution list in
             order to contact the core DSA managers.

          5. Once the above testing is completed, send email to the
             mhs-ds distribution list announcing the establishment of
             new X.500-based routes.

6. Notes on side effects

   The Long Bud Pilot Project, with its specific scope, is investigating
   a new direction in X.500 service usage.  This should facilitate and
   expedite the global deployment of X.500 on the Internet.

   Once the routing infrastructure illustrated by the Long Bud
   experiment is in place, the routing process will be able to take into
   account additional information to improve quality of service
   (minimizing messages conversions, enforcing various security policies
   established by MHS domains, taking advantage of recipients's
   capabilities stored in the Directory, ...).  While the Open Tree

   provides global connectivity, multiple private routing trees allow
   the use of various routing trees.
