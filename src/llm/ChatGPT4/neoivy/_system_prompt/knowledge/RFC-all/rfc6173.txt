1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Introduction

   iFCP (RFC 4172 [RFC4172]) provides Fibre Channel fabric functionality
   on an IP network in which TCP/IP switching and routing elements
   replace Fibre Channel components.  iFCP is used between iFCP
   gateways.  This protocol can be used by FC-to-IP-based storage
   gateways for Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) storage interconnects.

   Figure 1 provides an example of an interconnect between iFCP
   gateways.

          Figure 1: Interconnect between iFCP Gateways

   The iFCP MIB module is designed to allow a network management
   protocol such as SNMP to be used to monitor and manage local iFCP
   gateway instances, including the configuration of iFCP sessions
   between gateways.

3.  Technical Description

   The iFCP MIB module is divided into sections for iFCP local gateway
   instance management, iFCP session management, and iFCP session
   statistics.

   The section for iFCP gateway management provides default settings and
   information about each local instance.  A single management entity
   can monitor multiple local gateway instances.  Each local gateway is
   conceptually an independent gateway that has both Fibre Channel and
   IP interfaces.  The default IP Time Out Value (IP_TOV) is
   configurable for each gateway.  Other standard MIBs, such as the
   Fibre Management MIB [RFC4044] or Interfaces Group MIB [RFC2863], can
   be used to manage non-iFCP-specific gateway parameters.  The local
   gateway instance section provides iFCP-specific information as well
   as optional links to other standard management MIBs.

   The iFCP session management section provides information on iFCP
   sessions that use one of the local iFCP gateway instances.  This
   section allows the management of specific iFCP parameters, including
   changing the IP_TOV from the default setting of the gateway.

   The iFCP session statistics section provides statistical information
   on the iFCP sessions that use one of the local iFCP gateways.  These
   tables augment the session management table.  Additional statistical
   information for an iFCP gateway or session, that is not iFCP-
   specific, can be obtained using other standard MIBs.  The iFCP
   statistics are provided in both high-capacity (Counter64) and low-
   capacity (Counter32) methods.

   The following MIB module imports from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC
   [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], HCNUM-TC [RFC2856], IF-MIB
   [RFC2863], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001],
   FC-MGMT-MIB [RFC4044], ENTITY-MIB (v3) [RFC4133], and RMON2-MIB
   [RFC4502].

4.  Differences from RFC 4369

   As explained in [RFC6172], the iFCP address translation mode is
   deprecated.  This document obsoletes the iFCP MIB module [RFC4369]
   for this change.

       DESCRIPTION
   "Each entry contains information about one iFCP session consisting
    of a pair of N_PORTs joined by a single TCP/IP connection.  This
    table's INDEX includes ifcpLclGtwyInstIndex, which identifies the
    local iFCP gateway instance that created the session for the
    entry.

    Soon after an entry is created in this table for an iFCP session, it
    will correspond to an entry in the tcpConnectionTable of the TCP-MIB
    (RFC 4022).  The corresponding entry might represent a preexisting
    TCP connection, or it might be a newly created entry.  (Note that if
    IPv4 is being used, an entry in RFC 2012's tcpConnTable may also
    correspond.)  The values of ifcpSessionLclPrtlAddrType and
    ifcpSessionRmtPrtlIfAddrType in this table and the values of
    tcpConnectionLocalAddressType and tcpConnectionRemAddressType used
    as INDEX values for the corresponding entry in the
    tcpConnectionTable should be the same; this makes it simpler to
    locate a session's TCP connection in the TCP-MIB.  (Of course, all
    four values need to be 'ipv4' if there's a corresponding entry in
    the tcpConnTable.)

    If an entry is created in this table for a session, prior to
    knowing which local and/or remote port numbers will be used for
    the TCP connection, then ifcpSessionLclPrtlTcpPort and/or
    ifcpSessionRmtPrtlTcpPort have the value zero until such time as
    they can be updated to the port numbers (to be) used for the
    connection.  (Thus, a port value of zero should not be used to
    locate a session's TCP connection in the TCP-MIB.)

    When the TCP connection terminates, the entry in the
    tcpConnectionTable and the entry in this table both get deleted
    (and, if applicable, so does the entry in the tcpConnTable)."

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   Changing the following object values, with a MAX-ACCESS of read-
   write, may cause disruption in storage traffic:

        ifcpLclGtwyInstAddrTransMode
        ifcpLclGtwyInstFcBrdcstSupport
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultIpTOV
        ifcpLclGtwyInstDefaultLTInterval
        ifcpSessionIpTOV

   Changing the following object value, with a MAX-ACCESS of read-write,
   may cause a user to lose track of the iFCP gateway:

        ifcpLclGtwyInstDescr

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   The following object tables provide information about storage traffic
   sessions, and can indicate to a user who is communicating and
   exchanging storage data:

        ifcpLclGtwyInstTable
        ifcpSessionAttributesTable

RFC 6173                        iFCP MIB                      March 2011


   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example, by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
   ----------        -----------------------
   ifcpMgmtMIB       { transmission 230 }
