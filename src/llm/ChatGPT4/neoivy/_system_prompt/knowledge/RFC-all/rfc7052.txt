1.  Introduction

   This document describes the Management Information Base (MIB) module
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   Specifically, the MIB for managing devices that support the
   Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) is described.

   LISP [RFC6830] specifies a network-based architecture and mechanisms
   that implement a new semantic for IP addressing using two separate
   name spaces: Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), used within sites, and
   Routing Locators (RLOCs), used on the transit networks that make up
   the Internet infrastructure.  To achieve this separation, LISP
   defines protocol mechanisms for mapping from EIDs to RLOCs.

   From a data-plane perspective, LISP traffic is handled exclusively at
   the network layer by devices performing Ingress Tunnel Router (ITR)
   and Egress Tunnel Router (ETR) LISP functions.  Data-plane operations
   performed by these devices are described in [RFC6830].  Additionally,
   data-plane interworking between legacy (Internet) and LISP sites is
   implemented by devices performing Proxy ITR (PITR) and Proxy ETR
   (PETR) functions.  The data-plane operations of these devices is
   described in [RFC6832].

   From a control-plane perspective, LISP employs mechanisms related to
   creating, maintaining, and resolving mappings from EIDs to RLOCs.
   LISP ITRs, ETRs, PITRs, and PETRs perform specific control-plane
   functions, and these control-plane operations are described in
   [RFC6830].  Additionally, LISP infrastructure devices supporting LISP
   control-plane functionality include Map-Servers and Map-Resolvers,
   and the control-plane operations of these devices are described in
   [RFC6833].

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

RFC 7052                        LISP MIB                    October 2013


   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

5.  LISP MIB Objectives

   The objectives for this LISP MIB module are to provide a read-only
   mechanism to support the following functions:

   o  Provide a means for obtaining (read-only) a current status of LISP
      features enabled on a device, and (read-only) a current status of
      configuration attributes related to those features.  As one
      example, this MIB could determine the ON/OFF status of LISP
      features such as ITR, ETR, PITR, PETR, MS, or MR support,
      specifically as related to IPv4 or IPv6 address families as well
      as the LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) [LCAF] with IANA
      assigned Address Family Number 16387.  Other examples could
      include obtaining the (read-only) status of whether RLOC-Probing
      is enabled, obtaining the status of whether the use of a PETR is
      configured, and obtaining the (read-only) values of other related
      attributes such as the map-cache limit value, or a mapping time-
      to-live (TTL) value.

   o  Provide a means for obtaining (read-only) the current attributes
      of various LISP tables, such as the EID-to-RLOC policy data
      contained in the map-cache, or the local EID-to-RLOC policy data
      contained in the mapping-database.

   o  Provide a means for obtaining (read-only) the current operational
      statistics of various LISP functions, such as the number of
      packets encapsulated and decapsulated by the device.  Other
      counters of operational interest, depending on LISP function,
      include things like the current number of map-cache entries, and
      the total number and rate of map-requests received and sent by the
      device.

6.  Structure of LISP MIB Module

6.1.  Overview of Defined Notifications

   No LISP MIB notifications are defined.

6.2.  Overview of Defined Tables

   The LISP MIB module is composed of the following tables of objects:

   lispFeatures -  This table provides information representing the
      various lisp features that can be enabled on LISP devices.

   lispIidToVrf -  This table provides information representing the
      mapping of a LISP Instance ID to a VRF (Virtual Routing and

      routing locators contained in the EID-to-RLOC database configured
      on an ETR.

   lispMapCache -  This table represents the short-lived, on-demand
      table maintained on an ITR that stores, tracks, and times-out EID-
      to-RLOC mappings.

   lispMapCacheLocator -  This table represents the set of locators per
      EID-Prefix contained in the map-cache table of an ITR.

   lispConfiguredLocator -  This table represents the set of routing
      locators configured on a LISP device.

   lispEidRegistration -  This table provides the properties of each
      EID-Prefix that is registered with this device when configured to
      be a Map-Server.

   lispEidRegistrationEtr -  This table provides the properties of the
      different ETRs that send registers, for a given EID-Prefix, to
      this device when configured to be a Map-Server.

   lispEidRegistrationLocator -  This table provides the properties of
      the different locators per EID prefix that is registered with this
      device when configured to be a Map-Server.

   lispUseMapServer -  This table provides the properties of all Map-
      Servers that this device is configured to use.

   lispUseMapResolver -  This table provides the properties of all Map-
      Resolvers that this device is configured to use.

   lispUseProxyEtr -  This table provides the properties of all Proxy
      ETRs that this device is configured to use.

LispAddressType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    DISPLAY-HINT "39a"
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
      "LISP architecture can be applied to a wide variety of
       address-families.  This textual-convention is a generalization
       for representing addresses belonging to those address-families.
       For convenience, this document refers to any such address as a
       LISP address.  LispAddressType textual-convention consists of
       the following four-tuple:
       1. IANA Address Family Number: A field of length 2 octets,
          whose value is of the form following the assigned
          AddressFamilyNumbers textual-convention described in
          IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB DEFINITIONS, available from
          http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaaddressfamilynumbers-mib.
          The enumerations are also listed in [IANA].  Note that this
          list of address family numbers is maintained by IANA.
       2. Length of LISP address: A field of length 1 octet, whose
          value indicates the octet-length of the next (third)
          field of this LispAddressType four-tuple.
       3. LISP address: A field of variable length as indicated in
          the previous (second) field, whose value is an address
          of the IANA Address Family indicated in the first field
          of this LispAddressType four-tuple.  Note that any of
          the IANA Address Families can be represented.
          Particularly when the address family is LISP Canonical
          Address Format (LCAF)
          with IANA-assigned Address Family Number 16387, then the
          first octet of this field indicates the LCAF type, and the
          rest of this field is same as the encoding format of the
          LISP Canonical Address after the length field, as defined
          in LCAF document.
       4. Mask-length of address: A field of length 1 octet, whose
          value is the mask-length to be applied to the LISP
          address specified in the previous (third) field.

       To illustrate the use of this object, consider the LISP MIB
       Object below titled lispMapCacheEntry.  This object begins
       with the following entities:

       lispMapCacheEntry ::= SEQUENCE {
          lispMapCacheEidLength          INTEGER,
          lispMapCacheEid                LispAddressType,
           ... [skip] ...







Schudel, et al.               Experimental                      [Page 8]

RFC 7052                        LISP MIB                    October 2013


       Example 1: Suppose that the IPv4 EID-Prefix stored is
       192.0.2.0/24.  In this case, the values within
       lispMapCacheEntry would be:

          lispMapCacheEidLength  = 8
          lispMapCacheEid = 1, 4, 192.0.2.0, 24
          ... [skip] ...

       where 8 is the total length in octets of the next object
       (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType).  Then, the value
       1 indicates the IPv4 AF (per the
       IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB), the value 4 indicates that
       the AF is 4 octets in length, 192.0.2.0 is the IPv4 address,
       and the value 24 is the mask-length in bits.  Note that the
       lispMapCacheEidLength value of 8 is used to compute the
       length of the fourth (last) field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1
       octet -- as computed by 8 - (2 + 1 + 4) = 1.

       Example 2: Suppose that the IPv6 EID-Prefix stored is
       2001:db8:a::/48.  In this case, the values within
       lispMapCacheEntry would be:

          lispMapCacheEidLength  = 20
          lispMapCacheEid = 2, 16, 2001:db8:a::, 48
          ... [skip] ...

       where 20 is the total length in octets of the next object
       (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType).  Then, the value
       2 indicates the IPv6 AF (per the
       IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB), the value 16 indicates
       that the AF is 16 octets in length, 2001:db8:a:: is the IPv6
       address, and the value 48 is the mask-length in bits.  Note
       that the lispMapCacheEidLength value of 20 is used to
       compute the length of the fourth (last) field in
       lispMapCacheEid to be 1 octet -- as computed by
       20 - (2 + 1 + 16) = 1.

       Example 3: As an example where LCAF is used, suppose
       that the IPv4 EID-Prefix stored is 192.0.2.0/24 and it
       is part of LISP Instance ID 101.  In this case, the values
       within lispMapCacheEntry would be:

          lispMapCacheEidLength  = 11
          lispMapCacheEid = 16387, 7, 2, 101, 1, 192.0.2.0, 24
          ... [skip] ...

       where 11 is the total length in octets of the next object
       (lispMapCacheEID of type LispAddressType).  Then, the value
       16387 indicates the LCAF AF (see the
       IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB), the value 7 indicates that
       the LCAF AF is 7 octets in length in this case, 2 indicates
       that LCAF Type 2 encoding is used (see the LCAF document), 101
       gives the Instance ID, 1 gives the AFI (per the
       IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB) for an IPv4 address, 192.0.2.0
       is the IPv4 address, and 24 is the mask-length in bits.  Note
       that the lispMapCacheEidLength value of 11 octets is used to
       compute the length of the last field in lispMapCacheEid to be 1
       octet -- as computed by 11 - (2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4) = 1.

8.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

8.1.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The LISP MIB imports the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION AddressFamilyNumbers from
   the IANA-ADDRESS-FAMILY-NUMBERS-MIB DEFINITIONS [IANA].

   The LISP MIB imports mib-2, Unsigned32, Counter64, Integer32, and
   TimeTicks from SNMPv2-SMI -- [RFC2578].





Schudel, et al.               Experimental                     [Page 62]

RFC 7052                        LISP MIB                    October 2013


   The LISP MIB imports TruthValue, TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, TimeStamp, and
   TimeTicks from SNMPv2-TC -- [RFC2579].

   The LISP MIB imports MODULE-COMPLIANCE from SNMPv2-TC -- [RFC2580].

   The LISP MIB imports MplsL3VpnName from MPLS-L3VPN-STD-MIB --
   [RFC4382].

9.  Security Considerations

   There are no management objects defined in this MIB module that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  So, if this
   MIB module is implemented correctly, then there is no risk that an
   intruder can alter or create any management objects of this MIB
   module via direct SNMP SET operations.

   There are no readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with
   a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) that are considered
   sensitive.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

              Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
              ----------        -----------------------

              lispMIB            { mib-2 220 }

   IANA has allocated a new value in the "SMI Network Management MGMT
   Codes Internet-standard MIB" subregistry of the "Network Management
   Parameters" registry, according to the following registration data:

      Decimal: 220
      Name: lispMIB
