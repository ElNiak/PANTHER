Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) for Uniform
   Resource Namespace (URN) resources published by the 3rd Generation
   Partnership Project (3GPP). 3GPP defines and manages resources that
   utilize this URN name model.  Management activities for these and
   other resource types are provided by the 3GPP Support Team.

RFC 5279                 URN Namespace for 3GPP                July 2008


1.  Introduction

   3GPP is a cooperation of international telecommunication standards
   bodies developing technologies for cellular networks.  This activity
   is supported by a membership composed of network operators, equipment
   vendors, content providers, and other suppliers to the mobile market.

   Some of the technologies being developed by 3GPP need URN namespaces
   that are managed so that they are unique and persistent.  To assure
   that the uniqueness is absolute, the registration of a specific NID
   for use by 3GPP was deemed appropriate.  Therefore, a full and
   complete registration will follow the namespace specification process
   as defined in RFC 3406 [RFC3406].

2.  URN Specification for the 3GPP Namespace Identifier (NID)

   Namespace ID:

         3gpp

   Registration Information:

         registration version number: 1
         registration date:           2007-11-16

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

         Registering organization
            Name:    3rd Generation Partnership Project
            Address: ETSI
                     Mobile Competence Centre
                     650, route des Luciole
                     06921 Sophia-Antipolis Cedex
                     France

            Role:    Specifications Manager

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the
      "3gpp" NID will have the following structure:

            urn:3gpp:{3gpp-urn}

RFC 5279                 URN Namespace for 3GPP                July 2008


      where the "3gpp-urn" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the
      NSS(Namespace Specific String) Syntax described in RFC 2141
      [RFC2141] and defines a specific resource type.

   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      3GPP provides information on registration for each URN.  More
      information about 3GPP and the registration activities and
      procedures to be followed are available at:

            http://www.3gpp.org/tb/Other/URN/URN.htm

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      3GPP will manage resources using the "3gpp" NID and will be the
      authority for managing the "3gpp-urn" strings.  In the associated
      procedures, 3GPP will ensure the uniqueness of the strings
      themselves or shall permit secondary responsibility for management
      of well-defined sub-trees.

      3GPP may permit use of experimental type values that will not be
      registered.  As a consequence, multiple users may end up using the
      same value for separate uses.  Unregistered type values will only
      be allowed in sub-namespaces clearly marked as experimental, to
      help implementors avoid "leaking" experimental values into real
      use.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      3GPP will provide clear documentation of the registered uses of
      the "3gpp" NID.  This will be structured such that each "3gpp-
      urn", if needed, will have a separate description and registration
      table.

      The registration tables and information will be published and
      maintained by 3GPP on its web site.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      3GPP will provide procedures for registration of each type of
      resource that it maintains.  Each such resource may have three
      types of registration activities:

      1.  Registered values associated with 3GPP specifications or
          services

      2.  Registration of values or sub-trees to other entities

      3.  Name models for use in experimental purposes

   New Namespace Identifier (NID) labels

      The Entries in the registration table will be the following:

        3gpp-urn:    the registered value;
        Description: description of the registered value;
        Reference:   3GPP spec that defines the value;
        Contact:     person requesting the URN assignment.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with a Resolution Discovery System
      (RDS), as this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      No special considerations; the rules for lexical equivalence of
      RFC 2141 [RFC2141] apply.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      supported and maintained by 3GPP.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are representative URNs that could be assigned
   by 3GPP.  They are not actual strings that are assigned.

   urn:3gpp:featurephones

      Defines the "3gpp-urn" to be used for "featurephones".

   urn:3gpp:acme.foo-serv

      Defines the URN associated with the operator identified by the
      "3gpp-urn" value "acme", which has decided to register and provide
      information about its service identified by value "foo-serv".

4.  Namespace Considerations

   The 3rd Generation Partnership Project is developing a variety of
   enablers and applications.  Some of these require information to be
   fully specified.

   For proper operation, descriptions of the needed information must
   exist for the URNs and be available in a unique, reliable, and
   persistent manner.

   As 3GPP is ongoing and covers many technical areas, the possibility
   of binding to various other namespace repositories has been deemed
   impractical.  Each object or description, as defined in 3GPP, could
   possibly be related to multiple different other namespaces, so
   further conflicts of association could occur.  Thus, the intent is to
   utilize the 3GPP specifications manager as the naming authority for
   3GPP-defined URNs and its descriptions.

5.  Community Considerations

   The objects and descriptions required for enablers produced by 3GPP
   are generally available for use by other organizations.  The 3rd
   Generation Partnership Project Support Office will provide access and
   support for name requests by these organizations.  This support can
   be enabled in a timely and responsive fashion as new objects and
   descriptions are produced.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations other than those normally
   associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section registers a new URN NID with the registration provided
   in Section 2.

   "3gpp-urn" strings are identified by label managed by 3GPP.  Thus,
   creating a new label does not require any IANA action.
