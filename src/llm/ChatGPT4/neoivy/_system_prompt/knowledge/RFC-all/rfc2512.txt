1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   A separate memo [16] defines managed objects, in a manner independent
   of the type of network, for controlling the selection, collection and
   storage of accounting information into files for later retrieval via
   a file transfer protocol. This memo defines a set of ATM-specific
   accounting information which can be collected for connections on ATM
   networks.

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5],
        RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and
        RFC 2274 [12].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
   loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.

3.  Overview

   In [16], the items of accounting data to be collected are specified
   as a set of objects.  Which objects are contained in such a set is
   selectable by an administrator through the specification of one or
   more (subtree, list) tuples, where the set of objects to be collected
   is the union of the subsets specified by each tuple:

       'subtree' specifies a OBJECT IDENTIFIER value such that every
           object in the subset is named by the subtree's value appended
           with a single additional sub-identifier.

       'list' specifies an OCTET STRING value, such that if the N-th bit
           of the string's value is set then the the subset contains the
           object named by appending N as a single additional sub-
           identifier to the subtree.

   This memo specifies such a subtree containing a set of objects
   defining items of accounting information which are applicable to ATM
   connections.

   Note that all of the objects defined here have a MAX-ACCESS clause of
   not-accessible, since their purpose is not to be read/written by
   SNMP, but rather, to be the syntax and semantics of the set of
   information which can be represented within a single (subtree, list)
   tuple.

            "The fifth traffic descriptor parameter in the direction in
            which this switch receives cells on this connection.

            connection has no calling party sub-address, or it's value
            is unknown, then the value of this object is the zero-length

    DESCRIPTION
            "The connection's called party sub-address.  If the
            connection has no called party sub-address, or it's value is
            unknown, then the value of this object is the zero-length
            string."

atmAcctngRecordCrc16 OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING (SIZE(2))
    MAX-ACCESS  not-accessible
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The value of the CRC-16 checksum (as defined by ISO 3309
            (HDLC) and/or ITU X.25) calculated over the accounting
            record containing this object.

            While the mechanism for calculating/encoding the checksum
            value is specific to the method of encoding the accounting
            record, an accounting record containing this object is
            typically generated by initializing the value of this object
            to the all-zeros string ('0000'H), with the location of
            these zeros being saved.  After generating the record, the
            checksum is calculated over the whole connection record and
            then the all-zeros value is overwritten (at the saved
            location) by the calculated value of the checksum."

7.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module defines data items for potential use as accounting
   information.  Each of these data items is only accessible through a
   collected accounting file.  After being collected, the accounting
   data should be protected against modification or unauthorized
   deletion.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Prior to publication of this memo as an RFC, IANA is requested to
   make a suitable OBJECT IDENTIFIER assignment.
