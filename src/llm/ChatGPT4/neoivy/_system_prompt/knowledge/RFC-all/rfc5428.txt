1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Introduction

   A Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) is used to deliver broadband
   Internet, data, and/or voice access jointly with telephony service to
   a subscriber's or customer's premises using a cable network



Channabasappa, et al.       Standards Track                     [Page 2]

RFC 5428          PacketCable/IPCablecom Event MTA MIB        April 2009


   infrastructure.  An MTA is normally installed at the subscriber's or
   customer's premises and is coupled to a multiple system operator
   (MSO) using a hybrid fiber coax (HFC) access network.

   An MTA is provisioned by the MSO for broadband Internet, data, and/or
   voice service.  For more information on MTA provisioning, refer to
   [PKT-SP-PROV] and [RFC4682].  MTA devices include one or more
   endpoints (e.g., telephone ports), which receive call signaling
   information to establish ring cadence, and codecs, which provide
   telephony service.

   For more information on call signaling refer to, [PKT-SP-MGCP] and
   [RFC3435].

   For more information on codecs, refer to [PKT-SP-CODEC].

   Given the complexity of such systems, it is important that a suitable
   event management mechanism be defined to allow for effective
   management.  This MIB module provides objects suitable for generation
   and management of events on the MTA.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The terms "MIB module" and "information module" are used
   interchangeably in this memo.  As used here, both terms refer to any
   of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of RFC
   2578 [RFC2578].  Some of the terms used in this memo are defined
   below.  Some additional terms are also defined in the PacketCable(TM)
   Management Event Mechanism Specification [PKT-SP-MEM1.5] and the
   PacketCable MTA Device Provisioning Specification [PKT-SP-PROV].

3.1.  PacketCable

   PacketCable is a CableLabs-led initiative that is aimed at developing
   interoperable interface specifications for delivering advanced,
   real-time multimedia services over two-way cable plants.

3.2.  IPCablecom

   IPCablecom is an ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)
   project that includes architecture and a series of recommendations
   that enable the delivery of real-time services over the cable
   television networks using cable modems.

3.3.  MTA

   A Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) is a PacketCable- or IPCablecom-
   compliant device providing telephony services over a cable or hybrid
   system used to deliver video signals to a community.  It contains an
   interface to endpoints, a network interface, codecs, and all
   signaling and encapsulation functions required for Voice over IP
   transport, call signaling, and Quality of Service signaling.  An MTA
   can be an embedded or standalone device.  An Embedded MTA (E-MTA) is
   an MTA device containing an embedded Data Over Cable Service
   Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) cable modem.  A Standalone MTA
   (S-MTA) is an MTA device separated from the DOCSIS cable modem by a
   non-DOCSIS Media Access Control (MAC) interface (e.g., Ethernet,
   USB).

3.4.  Endpoint

   An endpoint or MTA endpoint is a standard RJ-11 telephony physical
   port located on the MTA and used for attaching the telephone device
   to the MTA.

3.5.  MSO

   A Multi-System Operator is a cable company that operates many head-
   end locations in several cities.

3.6.  UDP

   A User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless protocol built upon
   Internet Protocol (IP), as per RFC 768 [RFC768].

4.  Overview

   PacketCable, European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),
   and International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) IPCablecom-compliant Multimedia
   Terminal Adaptors (MTAs) are required to generate management events
   upon the occurrence of certain operational conditions (for instance,
   "AC power failure, MTA operational on battery power").  The complete
   set of conditions and the corresponding management events to be
   generated are specified in [PKT-SP-MEM1.5] (PacketCable),
   [ETSITS101909-22] (ETSI), and [ITU-T-J176] (ITU-T).  In addition, the
   MTA manufacturer is allowed to specify vendor-specific management
   events.  For example, vendor XYZ can specify "Memory read error,
   terminating process, code: XYZ123".

RFC 5428          PacketCable/IPCablecom Event MTA MIB        April 2009


   When management events are generated, they can either be stored in a
   local log on the MTA or transmitted using two possible mechanisms:
   SNMP or syslog.  This choice between storing and transmitting is
   required to be configurable and manageable by the management station
   for each management event (default values can be provided when the
   events are defined).  This document proposes a MIB that can provide
   for configuration and management of such management events.  A means
   to log the events is provided within the specified MIB module.  For
   syslog as a transport, the necessary information (format, transport,
   etc.) is also specified.  For SNMP as a transport, the MIB objects
   specified in the SNMP-TARGET-MIB and SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB as
   utilized, is specified in [RFC3413].

   Further, each management event can be uniquely identified using the
   'Organization ID' and 'Event ID'.  The 'Organization ID' is the
   private enterprise number of the organization specifying the event
   (e.g., 4491 for CableLabs) and a unique identifier that identifies
   the event.  The 'Event ID' is an identifier that uniquely identifies
   the event within the 'Organization ID' space.  This document does not
   specify any management events.  It only provides a mechanism to
   manage the storage and transmission of events.

   The EVENT MIB module specified in this document is intended to update
   the EVENT MIB modules from which it is partly derived:

   - the PacketCable 1.5 Management Event MIB Specification
     [PKT-SP-EVEMIB1.5] and

   - the ITU-T IPCablecom management event mechanism MIB requirements
     [ITU-T-J176].

   Several normative and informative references are used to help define
   Management Event MIB objects.  As a convention, wherever the
   requirements are equivalent at the time of the writing, the
   PacketCable reference is used.  However, MTA implementations MUST
   refer to the corresponding specifications to ensure compliance.

4.1.  Structure of the MIB

   The Management Event MIB module is identified by pktcIetfEventMib and
   is structured into the following sub-trees:

   - pktcEventControl specifies the management information pertinent to
     control of the device's event generation capabilities.

   - pktcEventThrottle specifies the management information pertinent to
     throttling the transmission of management events using syslog or
     SNMP.



Channabasappa, et al.       Standards Track                     [Page 5]

RFC 5428          PacketCable/IPCablecom Event MTA MIB        April 2009


   - pktcEventStatus specifies the management information for the device
     to report status information related to the generated events.

   - pktcEvents specifies the management information for the device to
     list all the events it is capable of generating.

   - pktcEventLog specifies the management information for the device to
     store the generated events.

   - pktcEventNotifications specifies the management information that
     defines the SNMP trap and inform messages.

4.2.  pktcEventControl

   The group of objects in this sub-tree provide for three important
   controls: ability to reset the event logs and event descriptions,
   syslog configuration, and event classes.

   Some highlights are as follows:

   pktcEventReset - this MIB object allows a management station to reset
   the event logs, the event descriptions, or both.

   pktcEventSyslog - this group of MIB objects allows the management
   station to provide information for transmission of events to a syslog
   server, such as message formats and transport protocols.

   pktcEventClassTable - this MIB table allows for MTAs to classify the
   management events into different categories, termed 'event classes'.
   It then allows for common operations to be affected across all the
   events pertaining to a specific event class.

4.3.  pktcEventThrottle

   As indicated earlier, the generated events can be stored locally or
   transmitted using SNMP, syslog, or both.  However, the management
   stations receiving such events may wish to control the rate of
   transmission of such events.  This event-throttling behavior is
   provided by the MIB objects in this sub-tree.

   Some highlights are as follows:

   pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus - this MIB object allows for
   transmissions to be unconstrained, maintained below threshold,
   stopped at the threshold, or inhibited.






Channabasappa, et al.       Standards Track                     [Page 6]

RFC 5428          PacketCable/IPCablecom Event MTA MIB        April 2009


   pktcEventThrottleThreshold - this MIB object specifies the throttle,
   i.e., the number of events over an interval that is considered to be
   the threshold.

   pktcEventThrottleInterval - this MIB object specifies the interval
   over which the threshold is calculated.

4.4.  pktcEventStatus

   This sub-tree is designed to provide status information related to
   event transmissions.  It currently contains one MIB object,
   pktcEventTransmissionStatus, that allows a client to report the
   status of event transmissions.

4.5.  pktcEvent

   This sub-tree is designed to provide a list of all the events that
   can be generated by an MTA and its associated descriptions.  The MIB
   objects are grouped under the MIB table pktcEventTable.

4.6.  pktcEventLog

   This sub-tree is designed to allow the MTA to store all the events
   that are generated during its operation.  The events are stored with
   information such as the time of the event, its description and
   related characteristics like severity levels.

4.7.  pktcEventNotifications

   This sub-tree specifies the notification information, i.e., when MTAs
   transmit messages using SNMP traps and informs.  SNMP traps refer to
   the SNMPv2-Trap-PDU.  SNMPv1 traps are disallowed.

5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   Some management objects defined in other MIB modules are applicable
   to an entity implementing this MIB.  In particular, it is assumed
   that an entity implementing the PKTC-IETF-EVENT-MIB module will also
   implement the 'interfaces' group of the IF-MIB [RFC2863].

5.1.  MIB Modules Required for IMPORTS

   The PKTC-IETF-EVENT-MIB MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI
   [RFC2578], SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB [RFC3411],
   SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IF-MIB [RFC2863], INET-ADDRESS-MIB [RFC4001],
   SNMP-TARGET-MIB [RFC3413], SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB [RFC3413], and the
   SYSLOG-TC-MIB [RFC5427].

       DESCRIPTION
               "This MIB object allows a management station to
               clear the local log of generated events, reset the
               management event descriptions, or both.

               MTAs generate management events.  These events are stored
               in the MIB table pktcEventLogTable.  If a management
               station needs to clear all the current entries (e.g.,
               after a troubleshooting operation is complete), it can
               do so by setting the resetEventLogTable(0) bit to a
               value of '1'.

               The MTA is pre-configured with the events that it can
               generate.  This is stored in the MIB table
               pktcEventTable.  This table also contains the
               descriptions associated with these events.  These
               descriptions can be modified by a management station.
               However, if the management station wishes to reset the
               descriptions to factory defaults, it can do so by
               setting the resetEventTable(1) bit to a value of '1'.

               The MTA actions are summarized below:

                 Bit resetEventLogTable(0) set to a value of '1'
                  - delete all entries in pktcEventLogTable;

RFC 5428          PacketCable/IPCablecom Event MTA MIB        April 2009


                  - reset the value of pktcEventLogIndex to '0'.

                 Bit resetEventTable(1) set to a value of '1'
                  - reset the pktcEventTable to the
                    factory default values.

                 Bits resetEventLogTable(0) and resetEventTable(1)
                 set to a value of '1'
                  - perform the above actions as though they were
                    performed individually (in any order).

                 Setting a reset bit to a value of '0' MUST NOT
                 result in any action.

               The MTA MUST perform the above actions regardless of
               persistence (i.e., storage in non-volatile memory).

               The MTA MUST always return a value of '00' when
               this MIB object is read.

               A management station that resets tables using this MIB
               object needs to be careful about the impact to other
               management stations that may be reliant on the
               information contained in the table(s) being reset.  For
               example, say management station A creates a specific set
               of event descriptions in the event table
               (pktcEventTable) for debugging purposes and expects any
               generated events to report the modified descriptions.  In
               such a case, if another management station resets the
               event table to factory defaults, any subsequent events
               will not contain the modified descriptions expected by
               management station A.  Such multi-manager contentions are
               not addressed within this MIB module.  Thus, management
               stations are RECOMMENDED to use this MIB object with
               care and caution, and only when absolutely required."

                   '1', it indicates that the state is true

               If the MTA is not configured with a syslog server

               and 'transmit error' bits MUST be set to a value of
               '0'.  For example, if an SNMP Manager is not

               validSnmpManagerAbsent(3) is set to a value of '1',

               'Server/Manager' indicators are based on the

               (SNMPv2-Trap-PDU); and bit snmpInform(3) refers to the
               transmission of events using SNMP INFORMs.

               Setting a bit to a value of '1' indicates that the
               corresponding action will be taken upon occurrence of
               this event.  If none of the bits are set, then no action
               is taken upon occurrence of the event.  The success of
               transmission using syslog and SNMP depends on the
               MTA configuration.  For example, a valid syslog server
               address is required for syslog message transmission.

               Specification of a management event does not necessarily
               include the actions to be taken upon its generation,
               i.e., it does not need to specify if a generated event

               MIB object pktcEventSeverityLevel, as follows:
                   - If the severity level of an event is emerg(0),
                   alert(1), crit(2), or err(3), set the bits for
                   local(0), syslog(1), and snmpInform(3) to a value
                   of '1' and set the remaining bits to a value of '0'.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

      Descriptor     OBJECT IDENTIFIER Value
      ----------     -----------------------
      pktcIetfEventMib     { mib-2 182 }

8.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   Security threats include events unreported on errors, redirection of
   events (deliberately or otherwise) or minimized reporting of errors.
   Such threats can mask certain misconfiguration attempts and denial of
   service attacks that can be recognized and thwarted via event
   reporting.














Channabasappa, et al.       Standards Track                    [Page 32]

RFC 5428          PacketCable/IPCablecom Event MTA MIB        April 2009


   MIB objects of significance include:

   - those that control the event generation, the target syslog address
     for events and the reporting status, i.e.:
       pktcEventReset
       pktcEventSyslogAddressType
       pktcEventSyslogAddress
       pktcEventSyslogPort
       pktcEventSyslogMessageFormat
       pktcEventSyslogTransport
       pktcEventClassStatus

   - those related to event classes, i.e.: pktcEventClassSeverity

   - those related to throttling, i.e.: pktcEventThrottleAdminStatus
     pktcEventThrottleThreshold pktcEventThrottleInterval

   - those related to the event reporting capabilities of an MTA, i.e:
     pktcEventSeverityLevel pktcEventReporting pktcEventText

   The MIB object pktcEventReset deserves special mention since access
   to this MIB object can be used to disrupt event collection by
   management stations.  For example, consider a management station that
   modifies the descriptions in the event table pktcEventTable.  It
   would then expect management events generated by the MTA to reflect
   the modified values.  A rogue management station that has access to
   the pktcEventReset can reset the event table, resulting in the
   management station not receiving events with the expected
   descriptions.  Further, a rogue management station with access to
   pktcEventReset can also clear local logs, eliminating local logs of
   generated events for management stations that are not configured to
   receive syslog or SNMP messages.  The same concerns apply when
   allowed management stations performing such operations are unaware of
   other management stations that may be reliant on the event table or
   the event log table for management or monitoring.  This MIB module
   does not address such multi-manager contentions, and recommends that
   the MIB object pktcEventReset be used with caution.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:






Channabasappa, et al.       Standards Track                    [Page 33]

RFC 5428          PacketCable/IPCablecom Event MTA MIB        April 2009


   pktcEventLogTable: This table contains the log of generated event
   messages.  Read access to this table might reveal some specific
   information that should be kept confidential.

   pktcEventTransmissionStatus: This MIB object reveals the status of
   event transmission and MAY be sensitive in some environments.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to perform GET or SET (change/create/delete) operations.
