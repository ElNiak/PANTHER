                         URN Namespace for IEEE

Abstract

   This document describes the Namespace Identifier (NID) 'ieee' for
   Uniform Resource Names (URNs) used to identify resources published by
   the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  IEEE
   specifies and manages resources that utilize this URN identification
   model.  Management activities for these and other resources types are
   handled by the manager of the IEEE Registration Authority.

1.  Introduction

   The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) is an
   organization whose objectives include the educational and technical
   advancement of electrical and electronic engineering,
   telecommunications, computer engineering, and allied disciplines.
   Within IEEE, standardization activities are organized into sponsors,
   such as the LAN/MAN Standards Committee, and then working groups such
   as 802.1 and 802.3.  See <http://standards.ieee.org>.

   As part of these specification efforts, there is a need to maintain
   identifiers in a managed namespace that is unique and persistent.  To
   ensure that this namespace's uniqueness is absolute, a registration
   of a specific URN Syntax [RFC2141] Namespace Identifier (NID) for use
   by IEEE is specified in this document, in full conformance with the
   NID registration process specified in URN Namespace Definition
   Mechanisms [RFC3406].

RFC 8069                 URN Namespace for IEEE            February 2017


2.  URN Specification for IEEE

   Namespace ID:

      ieee

   Registration information:

      registration version number: 1

      registration date: 2016-12-05

   Declared registrant of the namespace:

    Registering organization:

      Name:
        Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers

      Address:
        445 Hoes Lane
        Piscataway, NJ 08854
        USA

      Designated contact person:
        Angela Thomas
        Role: Manager, IEEE Registration Authority
        Email: ieee-registration-authority@ieee.org

   Declaration of syntactic structure:

      The Namespace Specific String (NSS) of all URNs that use the IEEE
      NID will have the following structure:

        urn:ieee:{IEEEresource}:{ResourceSpecificString}

      where "IEEEresource" is a US-ASCII string that conforms to the URN
      syntax requirements [RFC2141] and defines a specific class of
      resource type.  Each resource type has a specific labeling scheme
      that is covered by "ResourceSpecificString", which also conforms
      to the naming requirements [RFC2141].

      IEEE maintains a registration authority, the IEEE Registration
      Authority (IEEE RA), that will manage the assignment of
      "IEEEresource" and the specific registration values assigned for
      each resource class.

RFC 8069                 URN Namespace for IEEE            February 2017


   Relevant ancillary documentation:

      The IEEE Registration Authority (IEEE RA) provides information on
      the registered resources and the registrations for each.  More
      information about this registry and the procedures to be followed
      are available at:

      http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/ieeeurn.pdf

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:

      The IEEE RA will manage resources using the IEEE NID and will be
      the authority for managing the resources and subsequent associated
      strings.  In the associated procedures, the IEEE RA will ensure
      the uniqueness of the strings themselves or will permit secondary
      responsibility for management of well-defined sub-trees.

   Identifier persistence considerations:

      IEEE will update documentation of the registered uses of the IEEE
      NID as needed.  This will be structured such that each
      "IEEEresource" will have a separate description and registration
      table.

      The registration tables and information are published and
      maintained by the IEEE RA on its web site.

   Process of identifier assignment:

      IEEE RA will provide procedures for registration of each type of
      resource that it maintains.

   Process for identifier resolution:

      The namespace is not listed with an RDS; this is not relevant.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:

      The strings used as values for "IEEEresource" and
      "ResourceSpecificString" are case insensitive.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:

      No special considerations.

   Validation mechanism:

      None specified.  URN assignment will be handled by procedures
      implemented in support of IEEE activities.

   Scope:

      Global

3.  Examples

   The following examples are representative URNs that could be assigned
   by the IEEE RA.  While support for YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] was a
   catalyst for the creation of the namespace, the following are not
   necessarily the strings that would be assigned.

      urn:ieee:std:802.5:yang

      urn:ieee:foobar

4.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security considerations other than those
   normally associated with the use and resolution of URNs in general,
   which are described in Functional Requirements for URNs [RFC1737],
   URN Syntax [RFC2141], and URN Namespace Definition Mechanisms
   [RFC3406].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds "ieee" to the "Formal URN Namespaces" registry
   <http://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces>.  This is the
   defining document.
