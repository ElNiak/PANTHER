       Message Authentication Code for the Network Time Protocol

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP), as described in RFC 5905, states
   that NTP packets should be authenticated by appending NTP data to a
   128-bit key and hashing the result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.
   This document deprecates MD5-based authentication, which is
   considered too weak, and recommends the use of AES-CMAC as described
   in RFC 4493 as a replacement.

1.  Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol [RFC5905] states that NTP packets should be
   authenticated by appending NTP data to a 128-bit key and hashing the
   result with MD5 to obtain a 128-bit tag.  This document deprecates
   MD5-based authentication, which is considered too weak, and
   recommends the use of AES-CMAC [RFC4493] as a replacement.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Deprecating the Use of MD5

   RFC 5905 [RFC5905] defines how the MD5 digest algorithm described in
   RFC 1321 [RFC1321] can be used as a Message Authentication Code (MAC)
   for authenticating NTP packets.  However, as discussed in [BCK] and
   RFC 6151 [RFC6151], this is not a secure MAC and therefore MUST be
   deprecated.

3.  Replacement Recommendation

   If NTP authentication is implemented, then AES-CMAC as specified in
   RFC 4493 [RFC4493] MUST be computed over all fields in the NTP header
   and any extension fields that are present in the NTP packet as
   described in RFC 5905 [RFC5905].  The MAC key for NTP MUST be an
   AES-128 key that is 128 bits in length, and the resulting MAC tag

RFC 8573                       MAC for NTP                     June 2019


   MUST be at least 128 bits in length, as stated in Section 2.4 of RFC
   4493 [RFC4493].  NTP makes this transition possible as it supports
   algorithm agility as described in Section 2.1 of RFC 7696 [RFC7696].

   The hosts that wish to use NTP authentication share a symmetric key
   out of band.  So they MUST implement AES-CMAC and share the
   corresponding symmetric key.  A symmetric key is a triplet of ID,
   type (e.g., MD5 and AES-CMAC) and the key itself.  All three have to
   match in order to successfully authenticate packets between two
   hosts.  Old implementations that don't support AES-CMAC will not
   accept and will not send packets authenticated with such a key.

4.  Motivation

   AES-CMAC is recommended for the following reasons:

   1.  It is an IETF specification that is supported in many open source
       implementations.

   2.  It is immune to nonce-reuse vulnerabilities (e.g., [Joux])
       because it does not use a nonce.

   3.  It has fine performance in terms of latency and throughput.

   4.  It benefits from native hardware support, for instance, Intel's
       New Instruction set GUE [GUE].

5.  Test Vectors

   For test vectors and their outputs, refer to Section 4 of RFC 4493
   [RFC4493].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

7.  Security Considerations

   Refer to Appendices A, B, and C of the NIST document [NIST] for a
   recommendation for the CMAC mode of authentication; see the Security
   Considerations of RFC 4493 [RFC4493] for discussion on security
   guarantees of AES-CMAC.
