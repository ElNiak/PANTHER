RFC 8150              MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB           April 2017


1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols.  In particular, it defines
   objects for managing Multiprotocol Label Switching - Transport
   Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection.

   This MIB module should be used for configuring and managing MPLS-TP
   linear protection for MPLS-TP Label Switched Paths (LSPs).

   At the time of this writing, Simple Network Management Protocol
   (SNMP) SET is no longer recommended as a way to configure MPLS
   networks as described in RFC 3812 [RFC3812].  However, since the MIB
   module specified in this document is intended to work in parallel
   with the MIB module for MPLS specified in [RFC3812] and the MIB
   module for MPLS-TP Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
   identifiers in RFC 7697 [RFC7697], certain objects defined here are
   specified with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write or read-create so
   that specifications of the base tables in [RFC3812] and [RFC7697] and
   the new MIB module in this document are consistent.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14, RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

RFC 8150              MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB           April 2017


4.  Overview

   RFC 6378 [RFC6378] defines the protocol to provide a linear
   protection switching mechanism for MPLS-TP for a point-to-point LSP
   within the protection domain bounded by the endpoints of the LSP.
   RFC 7271 [RFC7271] describes alternative mechanisms to perform some
   of the functions defined in [RFC6378] and also defines additional
   mechanisms to provide operator control and experience that more
   closely model the behavior of linear protection seen in other
   transport networks.  Two modes are defined for MPLS-TP linear
   protection switching: the Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode
   and the Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode, as specified in
   [RFC6378] and [RFC7271], respectively.  The detailed protocol
   specification of MPLS-TP linear protection is described in [RFC6378]
   and [RFC7271].

   This document specifies a MIB module for Label Edge Routers (LERs)
   that support MPLS-TP linear protection as described in [RFC6378] and
   [RFC7271].  Objects defined in this document are generally applied to
   both the PSC mode and the APS mode.  If an object is valid for a
   particular mode only, it is noted in the description for the object.

5.  Structure of the MIB Module

5.1.  Textual Conventions

   The following new textual conventions are defined in this document:

   o  MplsLpsReq: This textual convention describes an object that
      stores the PSC Request field of the PSC control packet.

   o  MplsLpsFpathPath: This textual convention describes an object that
      stores the Fault Path (FPath) field and Data Path (Path) field of
      the PSC control packet.

   o  MplsLpsCommand: This textual convention describes an object that
      allows a user to perform any action over a protection domain.

   o  MplsLpsState: This textual convention describes an object that
      stores the current state of the PSC state machine.

5.2.  The MPLS-TP Linear Protection Switching Subtree

   MPLS-LPS-MIB is the MIB module defined in this document.  It is
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree per [RFC3811].  "LPS" as used in
   this document means "Linear Protection Switching".

RFC 8150              MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB           April 2017


5.3.  The Notifications Subtree

   Notifications are defined to inform the management station about
   switchovers, provisioning mismatches, and protocol failures of the
   linear protection domain.  The following notifications are defined
   for this purpose:

   o  The notification mplsLpsEventSwitchover informs the management
      station about the switchover of the active path.

   o  The notification mplsLpsEventRevertiveMismatch informs the
      management station about a provisioning mismatch in the revertive
      mode across the endpoint of the protection domain.

   o  The notification mplsLpsEventProtecTypeMismatch informs the
      management station about a provisioning mismatch in the protection
      type, representing both the bridge type and the switching type,
      across the endpoint of the protection domain.

   o  The notification mplsLpsEventCapabilitiesMismatch informs the
      management station about a provisioning mismatch in Capabilities
      TLVs across the endpoint of the protection domain.

   o  The notification mplsLpsEventPathConfigMismatch informs the
      management station about a provisioning mismatch in the protection
      path configuration for PSC communication.

   o  The notification mplsLpsEventFopNoResponse informs the management
      station that protocol failure has occurred due to a lack of
      response to a traffic switchover request in 50 ms.

   o  The notification mplsLpsEventFopTimeout informs the management
      station that protocol failure has occurred because no protocol
      message was received during at least 3.5 times the long PSC
      message interval [RFC7271].

5.4.  The Table Structures

   The MPLS-TP linear protection MIB module has four tables.  The tables
   are as follows:

   o  mplsLpsConfigTable

      This table is used to configure MPLS-TP linear protection domains.
      An MPLS-TP linear protection domain (or a protection domain) is
      identified by mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex.  A protection domain
      consists of two LERs, as well as the working path and protection
      path that connect the two LERs.  The objects in this table are



Kingston Smiler, et al.      Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 8150              MPLS-TP Linear Protection MIB           April 2017


      used to configure properties that are specific to the protection
      domain.  Two Maintenance Entities (MEs) MUST be defined for each
      protection domain: one for the working path and the other for the
      protection path.  Therefore, two entries in the
      mplsLpsMeConfigTable, which is for configuring the MEs used in
      protection switching, are associated to one entry in this table.

   o  mplsLpsStatusTable

      This table provides the current status information of MPLS-TP
      linear protection domains that have been configured on the system.
      The entries in the mplsLpsStatusTable have an AUGMENTS
      relationship with the entries in the mplsLpsConfigTable.  When a
      protection domain is configured or deleted in the
      mplsLpsConfigTable, then the corresponding row of that session in
      the mplsLpsStatusTable is automatically created or deleted,
      respectively.

   o  mplsLpsMeConfigTable

      This table is used to associate MEs to the protection domain.
      Each protection domain requires two MEs.  One entry in the
      mplsLpsConfigTable is associated with two entries in this table:
      one for the working path and the other for the protection path of
      the protection domain.  The mplsLpsMeConfigPath object in this
      table indicates that the path is either the working path or the
      protection path.  The ME is identified by mplsOamIdMegIndex,
      mplsOamIdMeIndex, and mplsOamIdMeMpIndex, which are the same index
      values as the entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable defined in [RFC7697].
      The relationship to the mplsOamIdMeTable is described in
      Section 6.1.

   o  mplsLpsMeStatusTable

      This table provides current information about the protection
      status of MEs that have been configured on the system.  When an ME
      is configured or deleted in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable, then the
      corresponding row of that session in the mplsLpsMeStatusTable is
      automatically created or deleted, respectively.

6.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

6.1.  Relationship to the MPLS OAM Identifiers MIB Module

   Entries in the mplsOamIdMeTable [RFC7697] are extended by entries in
   the mplsLpsMeConfigTable.  Note that the nature of the "extends"
   relationship is a sparse augmentation so that the entry in the
   mplsLpsMeConfigTable has the same index values as the entry in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable.  Each time that an entry is created in the
   mplsOamIdMeTable for which the LER supports MPLS-TP linear
   protection, a row is created automatically in the
   mplsLpsMeConfigTable.

   When a point-to-point transport path needs to be monitored, one ME is
   needed for the path and one entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable will be
   created.  But the ME entry in the mplsOamIdMeTable may or may not
   participate in protection switching.  If an ME participates in
   protection switching, an entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable MUST be
   created, and the objects in the entry indicate which protection
   domain this ME belongs to and whether this ME is for the working path
   or the protection path.  If the ME does not participate in protection
   switching, an entry in the mplsLpsMeConfigTable does not need to be
   created.

7.  Example of Protection Switching Configuration

   This example considers the protection domain configuration on an LER
   to provide protection for a co-routed bidirectional MPLS tunnel.  For
   the working path and protection path of the protection domain, two
   Maintenance Entity Groups (MEGs) need to be configured, and each MEG
   contains one ME for a point-to-point transport path.  For more
   information on the mplsOamIdMegTable and the mplsOamIdMeTable, see
   [RFC7697].

   Although the example described in this section shows a way to
   configure linear protection for MPLS-TP tunnels, this also indicates
   how the MIB values would be returned if they had been configured by
   alternative means.

   The following table configures a protection domain.

   In the mplsLpsConfigTable:
   mplsLpsConfigEntry ::= SEQUENCE
   {
      -- Protection domain index (index to the table)
      mplsLpsConfigDomainIndex  = 3,
      -- Protection domain name
      mplsLpsConfigDomainName   = "LPDomain3",
      mplsLpsConfigMode         = psc(1),
      mplsLpsConfigProtectionType = oneColonOneBidirectional(2),
      -- Mandatory parameters needed to activate the row go here
      mplsLpsConfigRowStatus    = createAndGo(4)
   }

   The following table associates the MEs with the protection domain.

   In the mplsLpsMeConfigTable:
   MplsLpsMeConfigEntry ::= SEQUENCE
   {
      -- MEG index (index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 1,
      -- ME index (index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMeIndex                  = 1,
      -- Maintenance Point (MP) index (index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMeMpIndex                = 1,
      -- Protection domain this ME belongs to
      mplsLpsMeConfigDomain             = 3,
      -- Configuration state
      mplsLpsMeConfigPath               = working(1)
   }
   {
      -- MEG index (index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMegIndex                 = 2,
      -- ME index (index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMeIndex                  = 2,
      -- MP index (index to the table)
      mplsOamIdMeMpIndex                = 2,
      -- Protection domain this ME belongs to
      mplsLpsMeConfigDomain             = 3,
      -- Configuration state
      mplsLpsMeConfigPath               = protection(2)
   }

          and the switching scheme, which can be either unidirectional
          or bidirectional.

          1+1
          In the 1+1 protection scheme, a fully dedicated protection
          path is allocated.  Data traffic is copied and fed at the
          source to both the working path and the protection path.
          The traffic on the working path and protection path is
          transmitted simultaneously to the sink of the protection
          domain, where selection between the working path and the
          protection path is performed.

          1:1
          In the 1:1 protection scheme, a protection path is allocated
          to protect against a defect, failure, or degradation on the
          working path.  In normal conditions, data traffic is
          transmitted over the working path, while the protection path
          functions in the idle state.  If there is a defect on the
          working path or a specific administrative request,
          traffic is switched to the protection path.

          bidirectional
          In the bidirectional protection scheme, both directions
          will be switched simultaneously even if the fault applies
          to only one direction of the path.

          unidirectional
          In the unidirectional protection scheme, protection switching
          will be performed independently for each direction of a
          bidirectional transport path.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection opens devices to attack.  These
   are the tables and objects and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The mplsLpsConfigTable is used to configure MPLS-TP linear
      protection domains.  Improper manipulation of the objects in this
      table may result in different behaviors than what network
      operators originally intended, such as delaying traffic switching
      or causing a race condition with server-layer protection after
      network failure (mplsLpsConfigHoldOff), delaying or speeding up
      reversion after recovering from network failure
      (mplsLpsConfigWaitToRestore), unexpected traffic switching
      (mplsLpsConfigCommand), or the discontinuance of the operation of
      a protection switching control process (mplsLpsConfigMode,
      mplsLpsConfigProtectionType).

   o  The mplsLpsMeConfigTable is used to assign each ME to either the
      working path or the protection path.  Improper manipulation of
      this object may result in the discontinuance of the operation of a
      protection switching control process.

   o  The notification is controlled by the mplsLpsNotificationEnable
      object.  In the case of the discontinuance of a protection
      switching control process, network operators may not be notified
      if the mplsLpsNotificationEnable object is compromised.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The mplsLpsStatusTable and the mplsLpsMeStatusTable collectively
      show the history and current status of the MPLS-TP linear
      protection domains.  They can be used to estimate the performance
      and qualities of networks configured to use MPLS-TP linear
      protection.  If an administrator does not want to reveal this
      information, then these tables should be considered
      sensitive/vulnerable.

   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is
   NOT RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned an OID of decimal 22 for the MPLS Linear Protection
   MIB module (MPLS-LPS-MIB) specified in this document in the "MIB
   Transmission Group - MPLS STD MIB" subregistry of the
   "Internet-standard MIB - Transmission Group" registry.
