Abstract

   This document describes a new DHCPv6 option for passing a list of
   Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) server addresses to a client.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a new option, called the SNTP [3] servers
   option, for passing information about SNTP servers in DHCPv6 [1].

2.  Requirements

   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [2].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology specific to IPv6 and DHCPv6 as defined
   in the "Terminology" section of the DHCPv6 specification [1].

4.  Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) Servers Option

   The Simple Network Time Protocol servers option provides a list of
   one or more IPv6 addresses of SNTP [3] servers available to the
   client for synchronization.  The clients use these SNTP servers to
   synchronize their system time to that of the standard time servers.
   Clients MUST treat the list of SNTP servers as an ordered list.  The
   server MAY list the SNTP servers in decreasing order of preference.

RFC 4075          SNTP Configuration Option for DHCPv6          May 2005


   The option defined in this document can only be used to configure
   information about SNTP servers that can be reached using IPv6.  The
   DHCP option to configure information about IPv4 SNTP servers can be
   found in RFC 2132 [4].  Mechanisms for configuring IPv4/IPv6 dual-
   stack applications are being considered, but are not specified in
   this document.

   The format of the Simple Network Time Protocol servers option is as
   shown below:

       0                   1                   2                   3

      option-code: OPTION_SNTP_SERVERS (31)

      option-len:  Length of the 'SNTP server' fields, in octets;
                   it must be a multiple of 16

      SNTP server: IPv6 address of SNTP server

5.  Appearance of This Option

   The SNTP servers option MUST NOT appear in messages other than the
   following: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-
   Request, and Reply.  If this option appears in messages other than
   those specified above, the receiver SHOULD ignore it.

   The option number for this option MAY appear in the Option Request
   Option [1] in the following messages:  Solicit, Request, Renew,
   Rebind, Information-Request, and Reconfigure.  If this option number
   appears in the Option Request Option in messages other than those
   specified above, the receiver SHOULD ignore it.

6.  Security Considerations

   The SNTP servers option may be used by an intruder DHCPv6 server to
   cause DHCPv6 clients to contact a rogue SNTP server, resulting in
   invalid synchronization of time in the client, finally leading to
   time-critical applications running inaccurately in the client
   machine.  Time accuracy can be crucial to some security algorithms.
   For example, expired certificates may gain a new life, making the
   applications running on the client machine less secure.  The
   inaccuracy can even cause clients to set their time incorrectly,
   making them vulnerable to replay attacks in protocols that use time
   stamps to detect replays.

   To avoid attacks through these options, the DHCPv6 client SHOULD use
   authenticated DHCPv6 (see the "Authentication of DHCP messages"
   section in the DHCPv6 specification [1]).

7.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has assigned an option code to the following from the
   option-code space defined in the "DHCPv6 Options" section of the
   DHCPv6 specification [1].

   Option Name            Value    Described in
   OPTION_SNTP_SERVERS    31       Section 4.
