Abstract

   This document seeks to record all usage of IPv4 addresses in
   currently deployed IETF Operations & Management Area accepted
   standards.  In order to successfully transition from an all IPv4
   Internet to an all IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken.
   One of these steps is the evolution of current protocols that have
   IPv4 dependencies.  It is hoped that these protocols (and their
   implementations) will be redesigned to be network address
   independent, but failing that will at least dually support IPv4 and
   IPv6.  To this end, all Standards (Full, Draft, and Proposed), as
   well as Experimental RFCs, will be surveyed and any dependencies will
   be documented.

1.  Introduction

   This document is part of a set aiming to record all usage of IPv4
   addresses in IETF standards.  In an effort to have the information in
   a manageable form, it has been broken into 7 documents conforming to
   the current IETF areas (Application, Internet, Operations &
   Management, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport).

   For a full introduction, please see the introduction [1].

2.  Document Organization

   The document is organized as described below:

   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full,
   Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is
   discussed in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with (around)
   RFC 3100. The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.  That is,
   each RFC is discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do
   not "look ahead" to see if the problems have already been fixed.

   Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5,
   and 6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole
   and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are
   correlated.

3.  Full Standards

   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as
   "Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely
   implemented and used throughout the Internet.

3.1.  RFC 1155 Structure of Management Information

   Section 3.2.3.2.  IpAddress defines the following:

      This application-wide type represents a 32-bit internet address.
      It is represented as an OCTET STRING of length 4, in network
      byte-order.

   There are several instances of the use of this definition in the rest
   of the document.

3.2.  RFC 1212 Concise MIB definitions

   In section 4.1.6 IpAddress is defined as:

      (6)  IpAddress-valued: 4 sub-identifiers, in the familiar
           a.b.c.d notation.

3.3.  RFC 1213 Management Information Base

   There are far too many instances of IPv4 addresses is this document
   to enumerate here.  The particular object groups that are affected
   are the IP group, the ICMP group, the TCP group, the UDP group, and
   the EGP group.

3.4.  RFC 2578 Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)

   Section 7.1.5 defines the IpAddress data type:

      The IpAddress type represents a 32-bit internet address.  It is
      represented as an OCTET STRING of length 4, in network byte-order.

      Note that the IpAddress type is a tagged type for historical
      reasons.  Network addresses should be represented using an
      invocation of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION macro.

   Note the deprecated status of this type;  see RFC 3291 for details on
   the replacement TEXTUAL-CONVENTION definitions.

3.5.  RFC 2579 Textual Conventions for SMIv2

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

RFC 3796     IPv4 in the IETF Operations & Management Area     June 2004


3.6.  RFC 2580 Conformance Statements for SMIv2

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.7.  RFC 2819 Remote Network Monitoring Management Information Base

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.8.  RFC 3411 An Architecture for Describing SNMP Management Frameworks

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.9.  RFC 3412 Message Processing and Dispatching for the Simple Network
   Management Protocol (SNMP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.10.  RFC 3413 SNMP Applications

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.11.  RFC 3414 User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the
       Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.12.  RFC 3415 View-based Access Control Model (VACM) for the Simple
       Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.13.  RFC 3416 Protocol Operations for Version 2 of the Simple Network
       Management Protocol (SNMP)

   Section 4.2.2.1., Example of Table Traversal, and Section 4.2.3.1.,
   Another Example of Table Traversal, both use objects from MIB2 whose
   data contains IPv4 addresses.  Other than their use in these example
   sections, there are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

3.14.  RFC 3417 Transport Mappings for Version 2 of the Simple Network
       Management Protocol (SNMP)

   Section 2 Definitions contains the following definition:

      SnmpUDPAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
          DISPLAY-HINT "1d.1d.1d.1d/2d"
          STATUS       current
          DESCRIPTION
                  "Represents a UDP address:

                      octets   contents        encoding
                      1-4     IP-address      network-byte order
                      5-6     UDP-port        network-byte order
                  "
         SYNTAX       OCTET STRING (SIZE (6))

   Section 8.1, Usage Example, also contains examples which uses IPv4
   address, but it has no significance in the operation of the
   specification.

3.15.  RFC 3418 Management Information Base for Version 2 of the Simple
       Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.  Draft Standards

   Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.
   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple,
   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are
   usually quite mature and widely used.

4.1.  RFC 1493 Definitions of Managed Objects for Bridges

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.2.  RFC 1559 DECnet Phase IV MIB Extensions

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.3.  RFC 1657 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Fourth
      Version of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP-4) using SMIv2

   The MIB defined in this RFC deals with objects in a BGP4 based
   routing system and therefore contain many objects that are limited by
   the IpAddress 32-bit value defined in MIB2.  Clearly the values of
   this MIB are limited to IPv4 addresses.  No update is needed,
   although a new MIB should be defined for BGP4+ to allow management of
   IPv6 addresses and routes.

4.4.  RFC 1658 Definitions of Managed Objects for Character Stream
      Devices using SMIv2

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.5.  RFC 1659 Definitions of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware
      Devices using SMIv2

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.6.  RFC 1660 Definitions of Managed Objects for Parallel-printer-like
      Hardware Devices using SMIv2

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.7.  RFC 1694 Definitions of Managed Objects for SMDS Interfaces using
      SMIv2

   This MIB module definition defines the following subtree:

   ipOverSMDS OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { smdsApplications 1 }

   -- Although the objects in this group are read-only, at the
   -- agent's discretion they may be made read-write so that the
   -- management station, when appropriately authorized, may
   -- change the addressing information related to the
   -- configuration of a logical IP subnetwork implemented on
   -- top of SMDS.

   -- This table is necessary to support RFC1209 (IP-over-SMDS)
   -- and gives information on the Group Addresses and ARP
   -- Addresses used in the Logical IP subnetwork.
   -- One SMDS address may be associated with multiple IP
   -- addresses.  One SNI may be associated with multiple LISs.

       ::= { ipOverSMDSEntry 5 }

   Although these object definitions are intended for IPv4 addresses, a
   similar MIB can be defined for IPv6 addressing.

4.8.  RFC 1724 RIP Version 2 MIB Extension

   As expected, this RFC is filled with IPv4 dependencies since it
   defines a MIB module for an IPv4-only routing protocol.  A new MIB
   for RIPng is required.

4.9.  RFC 1748 IEEE 802.5 MIB using SMIv2

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.10.  RFC 1850 OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base

   This MIB defines managed objects for OSPFv2 which is a protocol used
   to exchange IPv4 routing information.  Since OSPFv2 is limited to
   IPv4 addresses, a new MIB is required to support a new version of
   OSPF that is IPv6 aware.

4.11.  RFC 2115 Management Information Base for Frame Relay DTEs
       Using SMIv2

   This specification has several examples of how IPv4 addresses might
   be mapped to Frame Relay DLCIs.  Other than those examples there are
   no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.12.  RFC 2790 Host Resources MIB

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.13.  RFC 2863 The Interfaces Group MIB

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.  There is some
   discussion in one object definition about an interface performing a
   self test, but the object itself is IP version independent.

4.14.  RFC 3592 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Synchronous
       Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH)

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

4.15.  RFC 3593 Textual Conventions for MIB Modules Using Performance
       History Based on 15 Minute Intervals

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

5.  Proposed Standards

   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no
   requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases,
   Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards
   process.  They therefore are often just proposed ideas that are
   presented to the Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or
   they are one of many competing solutions to problems.  In these later
   cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose
   of this discussion.

5.1.  RFC 1239 Reassignment of experimental MIBs to standard MIBs

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

5.2.  RFC 1269 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Border
      Gateway Protocol: Version 3

   The use of BGP3 has been deprecated and is not discussed.

   Additionally there are many object definitions that use a SYNTAX of
   TAddress within the document.  Interestingly the SYNTAX for TAddress
   is an OCTET string of up to 256 characters.  It could easily

   Clearly a subsequent revision of this MIB module should define
   equivalent IPv6 objects.

5.61.  RFC 2561 Base Definitions of Managed Objects for TN3270E
       Using SMIv2

   The document states:

   The MIB defined by this memo supports use of both IPv4 and IPv6
   addressing.

   This specification is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware.

5.62.  RFC 2562 Definitions of Protocol and Managed Objects for

   A new TC should be defined to handle IPv6 addresses.

5.64.  RFC 2584 Definitions of Managed Objects for APPN/HPR in
       IP Networks

   Many of the object definitions described in this document assume the
   use of the IPv4 only TOS header bits.  It is therefore IPv4-only in
   nature and will not support IPv6.

5.65.  RFC 2594 Definitions of Managed Objects for WWW Services

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

5.70.  RFC 2622 Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL)

   The only objects in the version of RPSL that deal with IP addresses
   are defined as:

   <ipv4-address> An IPv4 address is represented as a sequence of four
      integers in the range from 0 to 255 separated by the character dot
      ".".  For example, 128.9.128.5 represents a valid IPv4 address.
      In the rest of this document, we may refer to IPv4 addresses as IP
      addresses.

   <address-prefix> An address prefix is represented as an IPv4 address
      followed by the character slash "/" followed by an integer in the
      range from 0 to 32.  The following are valid address prefixes:
      128.9.128.5/32, 128.9.0.0/16, 0.0.0.0/0; and the following address
      prefixes are invalid:  0/0, 128.9/16 since 0 or 128.9 are not
      strings containing four integers.

   There seems to be an awareness of IPv6 because of the terminology but
   it is not specifically defined.  Therefore additional objects for
   IPv6 addresses and prefixes need to be defined.

5.71.  RFC 2662 Definitions of Managed Objects for the ADSL Lines

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

5.72.  RFC 2667 IP Tunnel MIB

   The Abstract of this document says:

      This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) for use with
      network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
      particular, it describes managed objects used for managing tunnels
      of any type over IPv4 networks.  Extension MIBs may be designed
      for managing protocol-specific objects.  Likewise, extension MIBs
      may be designed for managing security-specific objects.  This MIB
      does not support tunnels over non-IPv4 networks (including IPv6
      networks).  Management of such tunnels may be supported by other
      MIBs.

   A similar MIB for tunneling over IPv6 should be defined.

5.73.  RFC 2669 DOCSIS Cable Device MIB Cable Device Management
       Information Base for DOCSIS compliant Cable Modems and
       Cable Modem Termination Systems

   This document states:

      Please note that the DOCSIS 1.0 standard only requires Cable
      Modems to implement SNMPv1 and to process IPv4 customer traffic.
      Design choices in this MIB reflect those requirements.  Future
      versions of the DOCSIS standard are expected to require support
      for SNMPv3 and IPv6 as well.

5.74.  RFC 2670 Radio Frequency (RF) Interface Management Information
       Base for MCNS/DOCSIS compliant RF interfaces

      This MIB defines the following objects:

DocsIfCmtsCmStatusEntry ::= SEQUENCE {

5.86.  RFC 2787 Definitions of Managed Objects for the Virtual
       Router Redundancy Protocol

   As stated in the Overview section:

      Since the VRRP protocol is intended for use with IPv4 routers
      only, this MIB uses the SYNTAX for IP addresses which is specific

6.  Experimental RFCs

   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have
   widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often
   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented
   to the Internet community in order to allow potential
   interoperability or some other potential useful scenario.  In a few
   cases, they are presented as alternatives to the mainstream solution
   to an acknowledged problem.

6.1.  RFC 1187 Bulk Table Retrieval with the SNMP

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this specification.

7.  Summary of Results

   In the initial survey of RFCs, 36 positives were identified out of a
   total of 153, broken down as follows:

         Standards:                         6 out of  15 or 40.00%
         Draft Standards:                   4 out of  15 or 26.67%
         Proposed Standards:               26 out of 112 or 23.21%
         Experimental RFCs:                 0 out of  11 or  0.00%

   Of those identified, many require no action because they document
   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols
   that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups.
   Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be
   updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not
   updated.  The remaining instances are documented below.

7.1.  Standards

7.1.1.  STD 16, Structure of Management Information (RFCs 1155 and 1212)

   RFC 1155 and RFC 1212 (along with the informational document RFC
   1215) define SMIv1.  These documents have been superseded by RFCs
   2578, 2579, and 2580 which define SMIv2.  Since SMIv1 is no longer
   being used as the basis for new IETF MIB modules, the limitations
   identified in this Internet Standard do not require any action.

7.1.2.  STD 17 Simple Network Management Protocol (RFC 1213)

   The limitations identified have been addressed, because RFC 1213 has
   been split into multiple modules which are all IPv6 capable.

7.2.  Draft Standards

7.2.1.  BGP4 MIB (RFC 1657)

   This problem is currently being addressed by the Inter Domain Routing
   (IDR) WG [2].

7.2.2.  SMDS MIB (RFC 1694)

   See Internet Area standards.  Once a specification for IPv6 over SMDS
   is created a new MIB must be defined.

7.2.3.  RIPv2 MIB (RFC 1724)

   There is no updated MIB module to cover the problems outlined.  A new
   MIB module should be defined.

RFC 3796     IPv4 in the IETF Operations & Management Area     June 2004


7.2.4.  OSPFv2 MIB (RFC 1850)

   This problem is currently being addressed by the OSPF WG [3].

7.2.5.  Transport MIB (RFC 1906)

   RFC 1906 has been obsoleted by RFC 3417, Transport Mappings for SNMP,
   and the limitations of this specification have been addressed by that
   RFC, which defines TCs that can be used to specify transport domains
   in an IP version-independent way.  RFC 3419 recommends that those TCs
   be used in place of SnmpUDPAddress when IPv6 support is required and
   for all new applications that are not SNMP-specific.

7.3.  Proposed Standards

7.3.1.  MIB for Multiprotocol Interconnect over X.25 (RFC 1461)

   This problem has not been addressed.  If a user requirement for IPv6
   over X.25 develops (which is thought to be unlikely) then this MIB
   module will need to be updated in order to accommodate it.

7.3.2.  PPP IPCP MIB (RFC 1473)

   There is no updated MIB to cover the problems outlined.  A new MIB
   should be defined.

7.3.3.  Appletalk MIB (RFC 1742)

   This problem has not been addressed.  If a user requirement for IPv6
   over Appletalk develops (which is thought to be unlikely) then this
   MIB module will need to be updated (or a new MIB module will need to
   be created) in order to accommodate it.

7.3.4.  The Definitions of Managed Objects for IP Mobility
        Support using SMIv2 (RFC 2006)

   The problems are being resolved by the MIP6 WG [4].

7.3.5.  SMIv2 IP MIB (RFC 2011)

   This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG [5].

7.3.6.  SNMPv2 TCP MIB (RFC 2012)

   This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG [6].

RFC 3796     IPv4 in the IETF Operations & Management Area     June 2004


7.3.7.  SNMPv2 UDP MIB (RFC 2013)

   This issue is being resolved by the IPv6 WG [7].

7.3.8.  RMON-II MIB (RFC 2021)

   This issue has been brought to the attention of the RMONMIB WG.
   Currently, there is a work in progress [8] to update RFC 2021, but it
   does not address the problems that have been identified; it is
   expected that there will be a resolution in a future version of that
   document.

7.3.9.  DataLink Switching using SMIv2 MIB (RFC 2024)

   The problems have not been addressed and an updated MIB should be
   defined.

7.3.10.  IP Forwarding Table MIB (RFC 2096)

   This issue is being worked on by the IPv6 WG [9].

7.3.11.  Classical IP & ARP over ATM MIB (RFC 2320)

   The current version of Classical IP and ARP over ATM (RFC 2225) does
   not support IPv6.  If and when that protocol specification is updated
   to add IPv6 support, then new MIB objects to represent IPv6 addresses
   will need to be added to this MIB module.

7.3.12.  Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 ATM MIB (RFC 2417)

   The current version of Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 ATM (RFC 2022) does
   not support IPv6.  If and when that protocol specification is updated
   to add IPv6 support, then new MIB objects to represent IPv6 addresses
   will need to be added to this MIB module.

7.3.13.  ATM MIB (RFC 2515)

   The AToM MIB WG is currently collecting implementation reports for
   RFC 2515 and is considering whether to advance, revise, or retire
   this specification.  The problems identified have been brought to the
   attention of the WG.

7.3.14.  TN3270 MIB (RFC 2562)

   The problems identified are not being addressed and a new MIB module
   may need to be defined.

7.3.15.  Application MIB (RFC 2564)

   The problems identified are not being addressed and a new MIB module
   may need to be defined.  One possible solution might be to use the
   RFC 3419 TCs.

7.3.16.  Definitions of Managed Objects for APPN/HPR in IP Networks
         (RFC 2584)

   The problems identified are not addressed and a new MIB may be
   defined.

7.3.17.  RADIUS MIB (RFC 2618)

   The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB should be defined.

7.3.18.  RADIUS Authentication Server MIB (RFC 2619)

   The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB should be defined.

7.3.19.  RPSL (RFC 2622)

   Additional objects must be defined for IPv6 addresses and prefixes.

   [10] defines extensions to solve this issue, and it is being
   considered for publication.

7.3.20.  IPv4 Tunnel MIB (RFC 2667)

   The issue is being resolved.

7.3.21.  DOCSIS MIB (RFC 2669)

   This problem is currently being addressed by the IPCDN WG.

7.3.22.  RF MIB For DOCSIS (RFC 2670)

   This problem is currently being addressed by the IPCDN WG [11].

7.3.23.  VRRP MIB (RFC 2787)

   The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB may need to be
   defined.

7.3.24.  MIB For Traceroute, Pings and Lookups (RFC 2925)

   The problems have not been addressed and a new MIB may need to be
   defined.
