                   OSPFv3 Instance ID Registry Update

Abstract

   This document modifies the "Unassigned" number space in the IANA
   "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values" registry by dividing it in
   two halves -- one half Unassigned but managed via Standards Action,
   and the other Reserved for Private Use.  It updates RFC 5838.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5838] defined the "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values"
   registry for the purpose of mapping OSPFv3 Instance IDs to different
   address families.  The following table lists the value ranges that
   were allocated for [RFC5838] and Unassigned.

   +---------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | Value   | Description                                 | Reference |
   +---------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+
   | 0       | IPv6 unicast AF                             | [RFC5838] |
   | 1 - 31  | Base IPv6 Unicast AF dependent on local     | [RFC5838] |
   |         | policy                                      |           |
   | 32      | Base IPv6 Multicast                         | [RFC5838] |
   | 33-63   | IPv6 Multicast AFs dependent on local       | [RFC5838] |
   |         | policy                                      |           |
   | 64      | Base IPv4 Unicast AF                        | [RFC5838] |
   | 65-95   | IPv4 Unicast AFs dependent on local policy  | [RFC5838] |
   | 96      | Base IPv4 Multicast                         | [RFC5838] |
   | 97-127  | IPv4 Multicast AFs dependent on local       | [RFC5838] |
   |         | policy                                      |           |
   | 128-255 | Unassigned                                  | [RFC5838] |
   +---------+---------------------------------------------+-----------+

   In some networks, additional OSPFv3 instances may be required to
   operationally identify specific applications.  This need requires a
   pool of Instance IDs that the operator may locally assign for that
   purpose.

   For example, [OSPF-EMBED] describes an application in which IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 addresses [RFC6052] are used to transport IPv4 packets
   over an IPv6 network.  While the IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses do in
   fact represent IPv6 destinations, it would be operationally
   beneficial to be able to easily identify the specific application by
   having a separate space to do so.  This benefit is enabled by the
   allocation of a range of Private Use Instance IDs.

RFC 6969           OSPFv3 Instance ID Registry Update          July 2013


   This document modifies the IANA "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family
   Values" registry by designating a range as Reserved for Private Use.
   For the remaining unassigned values, the registration procedure is
   Standards Action.

2.  OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values Registry Update

   The IANA "OSPFv3 Instance ID Address Family Values" registry has been
   updated so that Instance IDs from 192-255 are Reserved for Private
   Use [RFC5226].  For the remaining unassigned values (128-191), the
   registration procedure is Standards Action.  The registry now shows:

   +--------------------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | Value                    | Description   | Reference             |
   +--------------------------+---------------+-----------------------+
   | 128-191                  | Unassigned    | 192-255               |
   | Reserved for Private Use | this document | Private Use [RFC5226] |
   +--------------------------+---------------+-----------------------+

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the modification of the "OSPFv3 Instance ID
   Address Family Values" registry as described in Section 2.  The
   reference to [RFC5838] has been removed from the registry for the
   modified ranges.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document modifies an IANA registry defined in [RFC5838].  It
   does not introduce any new security issues.

5.  Acknowledgements

   Liang, Ben Campbell, Adrian Farrel, and Richard Barnes for their
   review and input.
