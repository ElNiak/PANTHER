            Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI)
                      Control Interface / Triggers

Abstract

   This document describes the part of the Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) Control interface that allows a CDN to trigger
   activity in an interconnected CDN that is configured to deliver
   content on its behalf.  The upstream CDN can use this mechanism to
   request that the downstream CDN pre-position metadata or content or
   to request that it invalidate or purge metadata or content.  The
   upstream CDN can monitor the status of activity that it has triggered
   in the downstream CDN.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC6707] introduces the problem scope for Content Delivery Network
   Interconnection (CDNI) and lists the four categories of interfaces
   that may be used to compose a CDNI solution (Control, Metadata,
   Request Routing, and Logging).

   [RFC7336] expands on the information provided in [RFC6707] and
   describes each of the interfaces and the relationships between them
   in more detail.

   This document describes the "CI/T" interface -- "CDNI Control
   interface / Triggers".  It does not consider those parts of the
   Control interface that relate to configuration, bootstrapping, or
   authentication of CDN Interconnect interfaces.  Section 4 of
   [RFC7337] identifies the requirements specific to the CI/T interface;
   requirements applicable to the CI/T interface are CI-1 to CI-6.

   o  Section 2 outlines the model for the CI/T interface at a high
      level.

   o  Section 3 describes collections of Trigger Status Resources.

   o  Section 4 defines the web service provided by the downstream CDN.

   o  Section 5 lists properties of CI/T Commands and Status Resources.

   o  Section 6 contains example messages.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document reuses the terminology defined in [RFC6707] and uses
   "uCDN" and "dCDN" as shorthand for "upstream CDN" and "downstream
   CDN", respectively.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Model for CDNI Triggers

   A CI/T Command, sent from the uCDN to the dCDN, is a request for the
   dCDN to do some work relating to data associated with content
   requests originating from the uCDN.

   There are two types of CI/T Commands: CI/T Trigger Commands and CI/T
   Cancel Commands.  The CI/T Cancel Command can be used to request
   cancellation of an earlier CI/T Trigger Command.  A CI/T Trigger
   Command is of one of the following types:

   o  preposition - used to instruct the dCDN to fetch metadata from the
      uCDN, or content from any origin including the uCDN.

   o  invalidate - used to instruct the dCDN to revalidate specific
      metadata or content before reusing it.

   o  purge - used to instruct the dCDN to delete specific metadata or
      content.

   The CI/T interface is a web service offered by the dCDN.  It allows
   CI/T Commands to be issued and allows triggered activity to be
   tracked.  The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230].
   References to URL in this document relate to HTTP/HTTPS URIs, as
   defined in Section 2.7 of [RFC7230].

   When the dCDN accepts a CI/T Command, it creates a resource
   describing the status of the triggered activity -- a Trigger Status
   Resource.  The uCDN can poll Trigger Status Resources to monitor
   progress.

   The dCDN maintains at least one collection of Trigger Status
   Resources for each uCDN.  Each uCDN only has access to its own
   collections, the locations of which are shared when CDNI is
   established.






Murray & Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                    [Page 4]

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   To trigger activity in the dCDN, the uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the
   collection of Trigger Status Resources.  If the dCDN accepts the CI/T
   Command, it creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its
   location to the uCDN.  To monitor progress, the uCDN can GET the
   Trigger Status Resource.  To request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger
   Command, the uCDN can POST to the collection of Trigger Status
   Resources or simply delete the Trigger Status Resource.

   In addition to the collection of all Trigger Status Resources for the
   uCDN, the dCDN can maintain filtered views of that collection.  These
   filtered views are defined in Section 3 and include collections of
   Trigger Status Resources corresponding to active and completed CI/T
   Trigger Commands.  These collections provide a mechanism for polling
   the status of multiple jobs.

   Figure 1 is an example showing the basic message flow used by the
   uCDN to trigger activity in the dCDN and for the uCDN to discover the
   status of that activity.  Only successful triggering is shown.
   Examples of the messages are given in Section 6.

   The steps in Figure 1 are as follows:

   1.  The uCDN triggers action in the dCDN by POSTing a CI/T Command to
       a collection of Trigger Status Resources --
       "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/uCDN".  This URL was given to
       the uCDN when the CI/T interface was established.

   2.  The dCDN authenticates the request, validates the CI/T Command,
       and, if it accepts the request, creates a new Trigger Status
       Resource.

   3.  The dCDN responds to the uCDN with an HTTP 201 response status
       and the location of the Trigger Status Resource.

   4.  The uCDN can poll, possibly repeatedly, the Trigger Status
       Resource in the dCDN.

   5.  The dCDN responds with the Trigger Status Resource, describing
       the progress or results of the CI/T Trigger Command.

   The remainder of this document describes the messages, Trigger Status
   Resources, and collections of Trigger Status Resources in more
   detail.

2.1.  Timing of Triggered Activity

   Timing of the execution of CI/T Commands is under the dCDN's control,
   including its start time and pacing of the activity in the network.

   CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" commands MUST be applied to all data
   acquired before the command was accepted by the dCDN.  The dCDN
   SHOULD NOT apply CI/T "invalidate" and "purge" commands to data
   acquired after the CI/T Command was accepted, but this may not always
   be achievable, so the uCDN cannot count on that.

   If the uCDN wishes to invalidate or purge content and then
   immediately pre-position replacement content at the same URLs, it
   SHOULD ensure that the dCDN has completed the invalidate/purge before
   initiating the pre-positioning.  Otherwise, there is a risk that the
   dCDN pre-positions the new content, then immediately invalidates or
   purges it (as a result of the two uCDN requests running in parallel).

   Because the CI/T Command timing is under the dCDN's control, the dCDN
   implementation can choose whether to apply CI/T "invalidate" and
   "purge" commands to content acquisition that has already started when
   the command is received.

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


2.2.  Scope of Triggered Activity

   Each CI/T Command can operate on multiple metadata and content URLs.

   Multiple representations of an HTTP resource may share the same URL.
   CI/T Trigger Commands that invalidate or purge metadata or content
   apply to all resource representations with matching URLs.

2.2.1.  Multiple Interconnected CDNs

   In a network of interconnected CDNs, a single uCDN will originate a
   given item of metadata and associated content.  It may distribute
   that metadata and content to more than one dCDN, which may in turn
   distribute that metadata and content to CDNs located further
   downstream.

   An intermediate CDN is a dCDN that passes on CDNI Metadata and
   content to dCDNs located further downstream.

   A "diamond" configuration is one where a dCDN can acquire metadata
   and content originated in one uCDN from that uCDN itself and an
   intermediate CDN, or via more than one intermediate CDN.

   CI/T Commands originating in the single source uCDN affect metadata
   and content in all dCDNs; however, in a diamond configuration, it may
   not be possible for the dCDN to determine which uCDN it acquired
   content from.  In this case, a dCDN MUST allow each uCDN from which
   it may have acquired the content to act upon that content using CI/T
   Commands.

   In all other cases, a dCDN MUST reject CI/T Commands from a uCDN that
   attempts to act on another uCDN's content by using, for example,
   HTTP 403 ("Forbidden").

   Security considerations are discussed further in Section 8.

   The diamond configuration may lead to inefficient interactions, but
   the interactions are otherwise harmless.  For example:

   o  When the uCDN issues an "invalidate" CI/T Command, a dCDN will
      receive that command from multiple directly connected uCDNs.  The
      dCDN may schedule multiple such commands separately, and the last
      scheduled command may affect content already revalidated following
      execution of the "invalidate" command that was scheduled first.







Murray & Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                    [Page 7]

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   o  If one of a dCDN's directly connected uCDNs loses its rights to
      distribute content, it may issue a CI/T "purge" command.  That
      purge may affect content the dCDN could retain because it's
      distributed by another directly connected uCDN.  But, that content
      can be reacquired by the dCDN from the remaining uCDN.

   o  When the uCDN originating an item of content issues a CI/T purge
      followed by a pre-position, two directly connected uCDNs will pass
      those commands to a dCDN.  That dCDN implementation need not merge
      those operations or notice the repetition, in which case the purge
      issued by one uCDN will complete before the other.  The first uCDN
      to finish its purge may then forward the "preposition" trigger,
      and content pre-positioned as a result might be affected by the
      still-running purge issued by the other uCDN.  However, the dCDN
      will reacquire that content as needed, or when it's asked to
      pre-position the content by the second uCDN.  A dCDN
      implementation could avoid this interaction by knowing which uCDN
      it acquired the content from, or it could minimize the
      consequences by recording the time at which the
      "invalidate"/"purge" command was received and not applying it to
      content acquired after that time.

2.3.  Trigger Results

   Possible states for a Trigger Status Resource are defined in
   Section 5.2.3.

   The CI/T Trigger Command MUST NOT be reported as "complete" until all
   actions have been completed successfully.  The reasons for failure,
   and URLs or patterns affected, SHOULD be enumerated in the Trigger
   Status Resource.  For more details, see Section 4.7.

   If a dCDN is also acting as a uCDN in a cascade, it MUST forward CI/T
   Commands to any dCDNs that may be affected.  The CI/T Trigger Command
   MUST NOT be reported as "complete" in a CDN until it is "complete" in
   all of its dCDNs.  If a CI/T Trigger Command is reported as
   "processed" in any dCDN, intermediate CDNs MUST NOT report
   "complete"; instead, they MUST also report "processed".  A CI/T
   Command MAY be reported as "failed" as soon as it fails in a CDN or
   in any of its dCDNs.  A canceled CI/T Trigger Command MUST be
   reported as "cancelling" until it has been reported as "cancelled",
   "complete", or "failed" by all dCDNs in a cascade.

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


3.  Collections of Trigger Status Resources

   As described in Section 2, Trigger Status Resources exist in the dCDN
   to report the status of activity triggered by each uCDN.

   A collection of Trigger Status Resources is a resource that contains
   a reference to each Trigger Status Resource in that collection.

   The dCDN MUST make a collection of a uCDN's Trigger Status Resources
   available to that uCDN.  This collection includes all of the Trigger
   Status Resources created for CI/T Commands from the uCDN that have
   been accepted by the dCDN, and have not yet been deleted by the uCDN,
   or expired and removed by the dCDN (as described in Section 4.4).
   Trigger Status Resources belonging to a uCDN MUST NOT be visible to
   any other CDN.  The dCDN could, for example, achieve this by offering
   different collection URLs to each uCDN and by filtering the response
   based on the uCDN with which the HTTP client is associated.

   To trigger activity in a dCDN or to cancel triggered activity, the
   uCDN POSTs a CI/T Command to the dCDN's collection of the uCDN's
   Trigger Status Resources.

   In order to allow the uCDN to check the status of multiple jobs in a
   single request, the dCDN MAY also maintain collections representing
   filtered views of the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.
   These filtered collections are "optional-to-implement", but if they
   are implemented, the dCDN MUST include links to them in the
   collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  The filtered
   collections are:

   o  Pending - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      have been accepted but not yet acted upon.

   o  Active - Trigger Status Resources for CI/T Trigger Commands that
      are currently being processed in the dCDN.

   o  Complete - Trigger Status Resources representing activity that
      completed successfully, and "processed" CI/T Trigger Commands for
      which no further status updates will be made by the dCDN.

   o  Failed - Trigger Status Resources representing CI/T Commands that
      failed or were canceled by the uCDN.

4.  CDNI Trigger Interface

   This section describes an interface to enable a uCDN to trigger
   activity in a dCDN.

   The CI/T interface builds on top of HTTP, so dCDNs may make use of
   any HTTP feature when implementing the CI/T interface.  For example,
   a dCDN SHOULD make use of HTTP's caching mechanisms to indicate that
   a requested response/representation has not been modified, reducing
   the uCDN's processing needed to determine whether the status of
   triggered activity has changed.

   All dCDNs implementing CI/T MUST support the HTTP GET, HEAD, POST,
   and DELETE methods as defined in [RFC7231].

   The only representation specified in this document is JSON [RFC7159].
   It MUST be supported by the uCDN and by the dCDN.

   The URL of the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources
   needs to be either discovered by or configured in the uCDN.  The
   mechanism for discovery of that URL is outside the scope of this
   document.

   CI/T Commands are POSTed to the dCDN's collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources.  If a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted by the dCDN,
   the dCDN creates a new Trigger Status Resource and returns its URI to
   the uCDN in an HTTP 201 response.  The triggered activity can then be
   monitored by the uCDN using that resource and the collections
   described in Section 3.

   The URI of each Trigger Status Resource is returned to the uCDN when
   it is created, and URIs of all Trigger Status Resources are listed in
   the dCDN's collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  This means
   all Trigger Status Resources can be discovered by the uCDN, so dCDNs
   are free to assign whatever structure they desire to the URIs for
   CI/T resources.  Therefore, uCDNs MUST NOT make any assumptions
   regarding the structure of CI/T URIs or the mapping between CI/T
   objects and their associated URIs.  URIs present in the examples in
   this document are purely illustrative and are not intended to impose
   a definitive structure on CI/T interface implementations.

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


4.1.  Creating Triggers

   To issue a CI/T Command, the uCDN makes an HTTP POST to the dCDN's
   collection of all of the uCDN's Trigger Status Resources.  The
   request body of that POST is a CI/T Command, as described in
   Section 5.1.1.

   The dCDN validates the CI/T Command.  If the command is malformed or
   the uCDN does not have sufficient access rights, the dCDN MUST either
   respond with an appropriate 4xx HTTP error code and not create a
   Trigger Status Resource or create a "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   containing an appropriate Error Description.

   When a CI/T Trigger Command is accepted, the uCDN MUST create a new
   Trigger Status Resource that will convey a specification of the CI/T
   Command and its current status.  The HTTP response to the dCDN MUST
   have status code 201 and MUST convey the URI of the Trigger Status
   Resource in the Location header field [RFC7231].  The HTTP response
   SHOULD include the content of the newly created Trigger Status
   Resource.  This is particularly important in cases where the CI/T
   Trigger Command has completed immediately.

   Once a Trigger Status Resource has been created, the dCDN MUST NOT
   reuse its URI, even after that Trigger Status Resource has been
   removed.

   The dCDN SHOULD track and report on the progress of CI/T Trigger
   Commands using a Trigger Status Resource (Section 5.1.2).  If the
   dCDN is not able to do that, it MUST indicate that it has accepted
   the request but will not be providing further status updates.  To do
   this, it sets the status of the Trigger Status Resource to
   "processed".  In this case, CI/T processing should continue as for a
   "complete" request, so the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to
   the dCDN's collection of complete Trigger Status Resources.  The dCDN
   SHOULD also provide an estimated completion time for the request by
   using the "etime" property of the Trigger Status Resource.  This will
   allow the uCDN to schedule pre-positioning after an earlier delete of
   the same URLs is expected to have finished.

   If the dCDN is able to track the execution of CI/T Commands and a
   CI/T Command is queued by the dCDN for later action, the "status"
   property of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "pending".  Once
   processing has started, the status MUST be "active".  Finally, once
   the CI/T Command is complete, the status MUST be set to "complete" or
   "failed".

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   A CI/T Trigger Command may result in no activity in the dCDN if, for
   example, it is an "invalidate" or "purge" request for data the dCDN
   has not yet acquired, or a "preposition" request for data that it has
   already acquired and that is still valid.  In this case, the status
   of the Trigger Status Resource MUST be "processed" or "complete", and
   the Trigger Status Resource MUST be added to the dCDN's collection of
   complete Trigger Status Resources.

   Once created, Trigger Status Resources can be canceled or deleted by
   the uCDN, but not modified.  The dCDN MUST reject PUT and POST
   requests from the uCDN to Trigger Status Resources by responding with
   an appropriate HTTP status code -- for example, 405 ("Method Not
   Allowed").

4.2.  Checking Status

   The uCDN has two ways to check the progress of CI/T Commands it has
   issued to the dCDN, as described in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.

   To allow the uCDN to check for changes in the status of a Trigger
   Status Resource or collection of Trigger Status Resources without
   refetching the whole resource or collection, the dCDN SHOULD include
   entity-tags (ETags) for the uCDN to use as cache validators, as
   defined in [RFC7232].

   The dCDN SHOULD use the cache control headers for responses to GETs
   for Trigger Status Resources and Collections to indicate the
   frequency at which it recommends that the uCDN should poll for
   change.

4.2.1.  Polling Trigger Status Resource Collections

   The uCDN can fetch the collection of its Trigger Status Resources or
   filtered views of that collection.

   This makes it possible to poll the status of all CI/T Trigger
   Commands in a single request.  If the dCDN moves a Trigger Status
   Resource from the active to the completed collection, the uCDN can
   fetch the result of that activity.

   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the whole collection.  An
   example of this is given in Section 6.2.4.








Murray & Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                   [Page 12]

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


4.2.2.  Polling Trigger Status Resources

   The uCDN has a URI provided by the dCDN for each Trigger Status
   Resource it has created.  It may fetch that Trigger Status Resource
   at any time.

   This can be used to retrieve progress information and to fetch the
   result of the CI/T Command.

   When polling in this way, the uCDN SHOULD use HTTP ETags to monitor
   for change, rather than repeatedly fetching the Trigger Status
   Resource.

4.3.  Canceling Triggers

   The uCDN can request cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command by
   POSTing a CI/T Cancel Command to the collection of all Trigger Status
   Resources.

   The dCDN is required to accept and respond to the CI/T Cancel
   Command, but the actual cancellation of a CI/T Trigger Command is
   optional-to-implement.

   The dCDN MUST respond to the CI/T Cancel Command appropriately -- for
   example, with HTTP status code 200 ("OK") if the cancellation has
   been processed and the CI/T Command is inactive, 202 ("Accepted") if
   the command has been accepted but the CI/T Command remains active, or
   501 ("Not Implemented") if cancellation is not supported by the dCDN.

   If cancellation of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is accepted by
   the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity.
   Issuing a CI/T Cancel Command for a "pending" Trigger Status Resource
   does not, however, guarantee that the corresponding activity will not
   be started, because the uCDN cannot control the timing of that
   activity.  Processing could, for example, start after the POST is
   sent by the uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.

   If cancellation of an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource
   is accepted by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T
   Command.  However, as with cancellation of a "pending" CI/T Command,
   the dCDN does not guarantee this.

   If the CI/T Command cannot be stopped immediately, the status in the
   corresponding Trigger Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelling",
   and the Trigger Status Resource MUST remain in the collection of
   Trigger Status Resources for active CI/T Commands.  If processing is
   stopped before normal completion, the status value in the Trigger

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   Status Resource MUST be set to "cancelled", and the Trigger Status
   Resource MUST be included in the collection of failed CI/T Trigger
   Commands.

   Cancellation of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource
   requires no processing in the dCDN.  Its status MUST NOT be changed
   to "cancelled".

4.4.  Deleting Triggers

   The uCDN can delete Trigger Status Resources at any time, using the
   HTTP DELETE method.  The effect is similar to cancellation, but no
   Trigger Status Resource remains afterwards.

   Once deleted, the references to a Trigger Status Resource MUST be
   removed from all Trigger Status Resource collections.  Subsequent
   requests to GET the deleted Trigger Status Resource SHOULD be
   rejected by the dCDN with an HTTP error.

   If a "pending" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the dCDN
   SHOULD NOT start the processing of that activity.  Deleting a
   "pending" Trigger Status Resource does not, however, guarantee that
   it has not started, because the uCDN cannot control the timing of
   that activity.  Processing may, for example, start after the DELETE
   is sent by the uCDN but before that request is processed by the dCDN.

   If an "active" or "processed" Trigger Status Resource is deleted, the
   dCDN SHOULD stop processing the CI/T Command.  However, as with
   deletion of a "pending" Trigger Status Resource, the dCDN does not
   guarantee this.

   Deletion of a "complete" or "failed" Trigger Status Resource requires
   no processing in the dCDN other than deletion of the Trigger Status
   Resource.

4.5.  Expiry of Trigger Status Resources

   The dCDN can choose to automatically delete Trigger Status Resources
   some time after they become "complete", "processed", "failed", or
   "cancelled".  In this case, the dCDN will remove the Trigger Status
   Resource and respond to subsequent requests for it with an HTTP
   error.

   If the dCDN does remove Trigger Status Resources automatically, it
   MUST report the length of time after which it will do so, using a
   property of the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  It is





Murray & Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                   [Page 14]

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   RECOMMENDED that Trigger Status Resources are not automatically
   deleted by the dCDN for at least 24 hours after they become
   "complete", "processed", "failed", or "cancelled".

   To ensure that it is able to get the status of its Trigger Status
   Resources for completed and failed CI/T Commands, it is RECOMMENDED
   that the uCDN polling interval is less than the time after which
   records for completed activity will be deleted.

4.6.  Loop Detection and Prevention

   Given three CDNs, A, B, and C, if CDNs B and C delegate delivery of
   CDN A's content to each other, CDN A's CI/T Commands could be passed
   between CDNs B and C in a loop.  More complex networks of CDNs could
   contain similar loops involving more hops.

   In order to prevent and detect such CI/T loops, each CDN uses a CDN
   Provider ID (PID) to uniquely identify itself.  In every CI/T Command
   it originates or cascades, each CDN MUST append an array element
   containing its CDN PID to a JSON array under an entry named
   "cdn-path".  When receiving CI/T Commands, a dCDN MUST check the
   cdn-path and reject any CI/T Command that already contains its own
   CDN PID in the cdn-path.  Transit CDNs MUST check the cdn-path and
   not cascade the CI/T Command to dCDNs that are already listed in the
   cdn-path.

   The CDN PID consists of the two characters "AS" followed by the CDN
   provider's Autonomous System number [RFC1930], then a colon (":") and
   an additional qualifier that is used to guarantee uniqueness in case
   a particular AS has multiple independent CDNs deployed -- for
   example, "AS64496:0".

   If the CDN provider has multiple ASes, the same AS number SHOULD be
   used in all messages from that CDN provider, unless there are
   multiple distinct CDNs.

   If the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI) described in
   [RFC7975] is implemented by the dCDN, the CI/T interface and the RI
   SHOULD use the same CDN PID.

4.7.  Error Handling

   A dCDN can signal rejection of a CI/T Command using HTTP status codes
   -- for example, 400 ("Bad Request") if the request is malformed, or
   403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found") if the uCDN does not have
   permission to issue CI/T Commands or it is trying to act on another
   CDN's data.




Murray & Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                   [Page 15]

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   If any part of the CI/T Trigger Command fails, the trigger SHOULD be
   reported as "failed" once its activity is complete or if no further
   errors will be reported.  The "errors" property in the Trigger Status
   Resource will be used to enumerate which actions failed and the
   reasons for failure, and can be present while the Trigger Status
   Resource is still "pending" or "active", if the CI/T Trigger Command
   is still running for some URLs or patterns in the Trigger
   Specification.

   Once a request has been accepted, processing errors are reported in
   the Trigger Status Resource using a list of Error Descriptions.  Each
   Error Description is used to report errors against one or more of the
   URLs or patterns in the Trigger Specification.

   If a Surrogate affected by a CI/T Trigger Command is offline in the
   dCDN or the dCDN is unable to pass a CI/T Command on to any of its
   cascaded dCDNs:

   o  If the CI/T Command is abandoned by the dCDN, the dCDN SHOULD
      report an error.

   o  A CI/T "invalidate" command may be reported as "complete" when
      Surrogates that may have the data are offline.  In this case,
      Surrogates MUST NOT use the affected data without first
      revalidating it when they are back online.

   o  CI/T "preposition" and "purge" commands can be reported as
      "processed" if affected caches are offline and the activity will
      complete when they return to service.

   o  Otherwise, the dCDN SHOULD keep the Trigger Status Resource in
      state "pending" or "active" until either the CI/T Command is acted
      upon or the uCDN chooses to cancel it.

4.8.  Content URLs

   If content URLs are transformed by an intermediate CDN in a cascade,
   that intermediate CDN MUST similarly transform URLs in CI/T Commands
   it passes to its dCDN.

   When processing Trigger Specifications, CDNs MUST ignore the URL
   scheme (HTTP or HTTPS) in comparing URLs.  For example, for a CI/T
   "invalidate" or "purge" command, content MUST be invalidated or
   purged regardless of the protocol clients used to request it.

5.  CI/T Object Properties and Encoding

   The CI/T Commands, Trigger Status Resources, and Trigger Collections,
   as well as their properties, are encoded using JSON, as defined in
   Sections 5.1.1, 5.1.2, and 5.1.3.  They MUST use the MIME media type
   "application/cdni", with parameter "ptype" values as defined below
   and in Section 7.1.

   Names in JSON are case sensitive.  The names and literal values
   specified in the present document MUST always use lowercase.

   JSON types, including "object", "array", "number", and "string", are
   defined in [RFC7159].

   Unrecognized name/value pairs in JSON objects SHOULD NOT be treated
   as an error by either the uCDN or dCDN.  They SHOULD be ignored
   during processing and passed on by the dCDN to any further dCDNs in a
   cascade.

5.1.  CI/T Objects

   The top-level objects defined by the CI/T interface are described in
   this section.

   The encoding of values used by these objects is described in
   Section 5.2.

5.1.1.  CI/T Commands

   CI/T Commands MUST use a MIME media type of "application/cdni;
   ptype=ci-trigger-command".

   A CI/T Command is encoded as a JSON object containing the following
   name/value pairs.

5.2.2.  Trigger Type

   Trigger Type is used in a Trigger Specification to describe trigger
   action.

   All trigger types MUST be registered in the IANA "CDNI CI/T Trigger
   Types" registry (see Section 7.2).

   A dCDN receiving a request containing a trigger type it does not
   recognize or does not support MUST reject the request by creating a
   Trigger Status Resource with a status of "failed" and the "errors"
   array containing an Error Description with error "eunsupported".

   The following trigger types are defined by this document:

   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | JSON String | Description                                         |
   +-------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
   | preposition | A request for the dCDN to acquire metadata or       |
   |             | content.                                            |
   | invalidate  | A request for the dCDN to invalidate metadata or    |
   |             | content.  After servicing this request, the dCDN    |

5.2.3.  Trigger Status

   Trigger Status describes the current status of the triggered
   activity.  It MUST be one of the JSON strings in the following table:

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | JSON      | Description                                           |

   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+
   | pending   | The CI/T Trigger Command has not yet been acted upon. |
   | active    | The CI/T Trigger Command is currently being acted     |
   |           | upon.                                                 |
   | complete  | The CI/T Trigger Command completed successfully.      |
   | processed | The CI/T Trigger Command has been accepted, and no    |
   |           | further status update will be made (can be used in    |
   |           | cases where completion cannot be confirmed).          |
   | failed    | The CI/T Trigger Command could not be completed.      |
   | canceling | Processing of the CI/T Trigger Command is still in    |
   |           | progress, but the CI/T Trigger Command has been       |
   |           | canceled by the uCDN.                                 |
   | canceled  | The CI/T Trigger Command was canceled by the uCDN.    |
   +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

5.2.4.  PatternMatch

   A PatternMatch consists of a string pattern to match against a URI,
   and flags describing the type of match.

   It is encoded as a JSON object with the following name/value pairs:

      Name: pattern

         Description: A pattern for URI matching.

         Value: A JSON string representing the pattern.  The pattern can
         contain the wildcards * and ?, where * matches any sequence of
         [RFC3986] pchar or "/" characters (including the empty string)
         and ? matches exactly one [RFC3986] pchar character.  The three
         literals $, * and ? MUST be escaped as $$, $* and $? (where $
         is the designated escape character).  All other characters are
         treated as literals.

         Mandatory: Yes.

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


      Name: case-sensitive

         Description: Flag indicating whether or not case-sensitive
         matching should be used.

         Value: One of the JSON values "true" (the matching is case
         sensitive) or "false" (the matching is case insensitive).

         Mandatory: No; default is case-insensitive match.

      Name: match-query-string

         Description: Flag indicating whether to include the query part
         of the URI when comparing against the pattern.

         Value: One of the JSON values "true" (the full URI, including
         the query part, should be compared against the given pattern)
         or "false" (the query part of the URI should be dropped before
         comparison with the given pattern).

         Mandatory: No; default is "false".  The query part of the URI
         should be dropped before comparison with the given pattern.

   Example of case-sensitive prefix match against
   "https://www.example.com/trailers/":

   {
       "pattern": "https://www.example.com/trailers/*",
       "case-sensitive": true
   }

5.2.5.  Absolute Time

   A JSON number, seconds since the UNIX epoch (00:00:00 UTC on
   1 January 1970).

5.2.6.  Error Description

   An Error Description is used to report the failure of a CI/T Command
   or failure in the activity it triggered.  It is encoded as a JSON
   object with the following name/value pairs:

      Name: error

         Value: Error Code, as defined in Section 5.2.7.

         Mandatory: Yes.

      Names: metadata.urls, content.urls, metadata.patterns,
      content.patterns

         Description: Metadata and content references copied from the
         Trigger Specification.  Only those URLs and patterns to which
         the error applies are included in each property, but those URLs
         and patterns MUST be exactly as they appear in the request; the
         dCDN MUST NOT generalize the URLs.  (For example, if the uCDN
         requests pre-positioning of URLs
         "https://content.example.com/a" and
         "https://content.example.com/b", the dCDN must not generalize
         its error report to the pattern
         "https://content.example.com/*".)

         Value: A JSON array of JSON strings, where each string is
         copied from a "content.*" or "metadata.*" value in the
         corresponding Trigger Specification.

         Mandatory: At least one of these name/value pairs is mandatory
         in each Error Description object.

      Name: description

         Description: A human-readable description of the error.

         Value: A JSON string, the human-readable description.

         Mandatory: No.

5.2.7.  Error Code

   This type is used by the dCDN to report failures in trigger
   processing.  All Error Codes MUST be registered in the IANA "CDNI
   CI/T Error Codes" registry (see Section 7.3).  Unknown Error Codes
   MUST be treated as fatal errors, and the request MUST NOT be
   automatically retried without modification.

6.  Examples

   The following subsections provide examples of different CI/T objects
   encoded as JSON.

   Discovery of the CI/T interface is out of scope for this document.
   In an implementation, all CI/T URLs are under the control of the
   dCDN.  The uCDN MUST NOT attempt to ascribe any meaning to individual
   elements of the path.

   In examples in this section, the URL "https://dcdn.example.com/
   triggers" is used as the location of the collection of all Trigger
   Status Resources, and the CDN PID of the uCDN is "AS64496:1".

6.1.2.  Invalidate

   Below is an example of a CI/T "invalidate" command -- another POST to
   the collection of all Trigger Status Resources.  This instructs the
   dCDN to revalidate the content at "https://www.example.com/a/
   index.html", as well as any metadata and content whose URLs are
   prefixed by "https://metadata.example.com/a/b/" using
   case-insensitive matching, and "https://www.example.com/a/b/" using
   case-sensitive matching, respectively.

6.2.  Examining Trigger Status

   Once Trigger Status Resources have been created, the uCDN can check
   their status as shown in the following examples.

6.2.1.  Collection of All Triggers

   The uCDN can fetch the collection of all Trigger Status Resources it
   has created that have not yet been deleted or removed as expired.
   After creation of the "preposition" and "invalidate" triggers shown
   above, this collection might look as follows:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*

   RESPONSE:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Length: 341

         "coll-complete": "/triggers/complete",
         "coll-failed": "/triggers/failed",
         "coll-pending": "/triggers/pending",
         "staleresourcetime": 86400,
         "triggers": [
             "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/0",
             "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/1"
         ]
     }

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


6.2.2.  Filtered Collections of Trigger Status Resources

   The filtered collections are also available to the uCDN.  Before the
   dCDN starts processing the two CI/T Trigger Commands shown above,
   both will appear in the collection of pending triggers.  For example:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/pending HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*

   RESPONSE:

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Length: 152
     Expires: Wed, 04 May 2016 08:49:11 GMT
     Server: example-server/0.1
     ETag: "4331492443626270781"
     Cache-Control: max-age=60
     Date: Wed, 04 May 2016 08:48:11 GMT
     Content-Type: application/cdni; ptype=ci-trigger-collection

     {
         "staleresourcetime": 86400,
         "triggers": [
             "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/0",
             "https://dcdn.example.com/triggers/1"
         ]
     }

   At this point, if no other Trigger Status Resources had been created,
   the other filtered views would be empty.  For example:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/complete HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*

     }

6.2.3.  Individual Trigger Status Resources

   The Trigger Status Resources can also be examined for details about
   individual CI/T Trigger Commands.  For example, for the CI/T
   "preposition" and "invalidate" commands from previous examples:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/0 HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1

6.2.4.  Polling for Changes in Status

   The uCDN SHOULD use the ETags of collections or Trigger Status
   Resources when polling for changes in status, as shown in the
   following examples:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/pending HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/0 HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*

     Content-Type: application/cdni; ptype=ci-trigger-status

   When the CI/T Trigger Command is complete, the contents of the
   filtered collections will be updated along with their ETags.  For
   example, when the two example CI/T Trigger Commands are complete, the
   collections of pending and complete Trigger Status Resources might
   look like:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/pending HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com

         ]
     }

6.2.5.  Deleting Trigger Status Resources

   The uCDN can delete completed and failed Trigger Status Resources to
   reduce the size of the collections, as described in Section 4.4.  For
   example, to delete the "preposition" request from earlier examples:

   REQUEST:

     DELETE /triggers/0 HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com
     Accept: */*

   RESPONSE:

     HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
     Date: Wed, 04 May 2016 08:48:22 GMT

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   This would, for example, cause the collection of completed Trigger
   Status Resources shown in the example above to be updated to:

   REQUEST:

     GET /triggers/complete HTTP/1.1
     User-Agent: example-user-agent/0.1
     Host: dcdn.example.com

         ]
     }

6.2.6.  Error Reporting

   In this example, the uCDN has requested pre-positioning of
   "https://newsite.example.com/index.html", but the dCDN was unable to
   locate metadata for that site:

   REQUEST:

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  CDNI Payload Type Parameter Registrations

   The IANA is requested to register the following new Payload Types in
   the "CDNI Payload Types" registry defined by [RFC7736], for use with
   the "application/cdni" MIME media type.

                 +-----------------------+---------------+
                 | Payload Type          | Specification |
                 +-----------------------+---------------+

7.2.  "CDNI CI/T Trigger Types" Registry

   The IANA is requested to create a new "CDNI CI/T Trigger Types"
   subregistry under the "Content Delivery Network Interconnection
   (CDNI) Parameters" registry.

   Additions to the "CDNI CI/T Trigger Types" registry will be made via
   the RFC Required policy as defined in [RFC5226].

   The initial contents of the "CDNI CI/T Trigger Types" registry
   comprise the names and descriptions listed in Section 5.2.2 of this
   document, with this document acting as the specification.

7.3.  "CDNI CI/T Error Codes" Registry

   The IANA is requested to create a new "CDNI CI/T Error Codes"
   subregistry under the "Content Delivery Network Interconnection
   (CDNI) Parameters" registry.

   Additions to the "CDNI CI/T Error Codes" registry will be made via
   the Specification Required policy as defined in [RFC5226].  The
   Designated Expert will verify that new Error Code registrations do
   not duplicate existing Error Code definitions (in name or
   functionality), prevent gratuitous additions to the namespace, and
   prevent any additions to the namespace that would impair the
   interoperability of CDNI implementations.

   The initial contents of the "CDNI CI/T Error Codes" registry comprise
   the names and descriptions of the Error Codes listed in Section 5.2.7
   of this document, with this document acting as the specification.

8.  Security Considerations

   The CI/T interface provides a mechanism to allow a uCDN to generate
   requests into the dCDN and to inspect its own CI/T requests and their
   current states.  The CI/T interface does not allow access to, or
   modification of, the uCDN or dCDN metadata relating to content
   delivery or to the content itself.  It can only control the presence
   of that metadata in the dCDN, and the processing work and network
   utilization involved in ensuring that presence.

   By examining "preposition" requests to a dCDN, and correctly
   interpreting content and metadata URLs, an attacker could learn the
   uCDN's or content owner's predictions for future content popularity.
   By examining "invalidate" or "purge" requests, an attacker could
   learn about changes in the content owner's catalog.





Murray & Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                   [Page 41]

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   By injecting CI/T Commands, an attacker or a misbehaving uCDN would
   generate work in the dCDN and uCDN as they process those requests.
   So would a man-in-the-middle attacker modifying valid CI/T Commands
   generated by the uCDN.  In both cases, that would decrease the dCDN's
   caching efficiency by causing it to unnecessarily acquire or
   reacquire content metadata and/or content.

   A dCDN implementation of CI/T MUST restrict the actions of a uCDN to
   the data corresponding to that uCDN.  Failure to do so would allow
   uCDNs to detrimentally affect each other's efficiency by generating
   unnecessary acquisition or reacquisition load.

   An origin that chooses to delegate its delivery to a CDN is trusting
   that CDN to deliver content on its behalf; the interconnection of
   CDNs is an extension of that trust to dCDNs.  That trust relationship
   is a commercial arrangement, outside the scope of the CDNI protocols.
   So, while a malicious CDN could deliberately generate load on a dCDN
   using the CI/T interface, the protocol does not otherwise attempt to
   address malicious behavior between interconnected CDNs.

8.1.  Authentication, Authorization, Confidentiality, Integrity
      Protection

   A CI/T implementation MUST support Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   transport for HTTP (HTTPS) as per [RFC2818] and [RFC7230].

   TLS MUST be used by the server side (dCDN) and the client side (uCDN)
   of the CI/T interface, including authentication of the remote end,
   unless alternate methods are used for ensuring the security of the
   information in the CI/T interface requests and responses (such as
   setting up an IPsec tunnel between the two CDNs or using a physically
   secured internal network between two CDNs that are owned by the same
   corporate entity).

   The use of TLS for transport of the CI/T interface allows the dCDN
   and the uCDN to authenticate each other using TLS client
   authentication and TLS server authentication.














Murray & Niven-Jenkins       Standards Track                   [Page 42]

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


   Once the dCDN and the uCDN have mutually authenticated each other,
   TLS allows:

   o  The dCDN and the uCDN to authorize each other (to ensure that they
      are receiving CI/T Commands from, or reporting status to, an
      authorized CDN).

   o  CDNI commands and responses to be transmitted with
      confidentiality.

   o  Protection of the integrity of CDNI commands and responses.

   When TLS is used, the general TLS usage guidance in [RFC7525] MUST be
   followed.

   The mechanisms for access control are dCDN-specific and are not
   standardized as part of this CI/T specification.

   HTTP requests that attempt to access or operate on CI/T data
   belonging to another CDN MUST be rejected using, for example,
   HTTP 403 ("Forbidden") or 404 ("Not Found").  This is intended to
   prevent unauthorized users from generating unnecessary load in dCDNs
   or uCDNs due to revalidation, reacquisition, or unnecessary
   acquisition.

   When deploying a network of interconnected CDNs, the possible
   inefficiencies related to the diamond configuration discussed in
   Section 2.2.1 should be considered.

8.2.  Denial of Service

   This document does not define a specific mechanism to protect against
   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the CI/T interface.  However, CI/T
   endpoints can be protected against DoS attacks through the use of TLS
   transport and/or via mechanisms outside the scope of the CI/T
   interface, such as firewalling or the use of Virtual Private Networks
   (VPNs).

   Depending on the implementation, triggered activity may consume
   significant processing and bandwidth in the dCDN.  A malicious or
   faulty uCDN could use this to generate unnecessary load in the dCDN.
   The dCDN should consider mechanisms to avoid overload -- for example,
   by rate-limiting acceptance or processing of CI/T Commands, or by
   performing batch processing.

RFC 8007                CDN Interconnect Triggers          December 2016


8.3.  Privacy

   The CI/T protocol does not carry any information about individual end
   users of a CDN; there are no privacy concerns for end users.

   The CI/T protocol does carry information that could be considered
   commercially sensitive by CDN operators and content owners.  The use
   of mutually authenticated TLS to establish a secure session for the
   transport of CI/T data, as discussed in Section 8.1, provides
   confidentiality while the CI/T data is in transit and prevents
   parties other than the authorized dCDN from gaining access to that
   data.  The dCDN MUST ensure that it only exposes CI/T data related to
   a uCDN to clients it has authenticated as belonging to that uCDN.

Appendix A.  Formalization of the JSON Data

   This appendix is non-normative.

   The JSON data described in this document has been formalized using
   the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) [CBOR-CDDL] (where "CBOR"
   means "Concise Binary Object Representation"), as follows:

 CIT-object = CIT-command / Trigger-Status-Resource / Trigger-Collection

 CIT-command ; use media type application/cdni; ptype=ci-trigger-command
 = {
   ? trigger: Triggerspec
   ? cancel: [* URI]
   cdn-path: [* Cdn-PID]
 }

 Trigger-Status-Resource ; application/cdni; ptype=ci-trigger-status
 = {
   trigger: Triggerspec
   ctime: Absolute-Time
   mtime: Absolute-Time
   ? etime: Absolute-Time
   status: Trigger-Status
   ? errors: [* Error-Description]
 }

 Trigger-Collection ; application/cdni; ptype=ci-trigger-collection
 = {
   triggers: [* URI]
   ? staleresourcetime: int ; time in seconds
   ? coll-all: URI
   ? coll-pending: URI
   ? coll-active: URI
   ? coll-complete: URI
   ? coll-failed: URI
   ? cdn-id: Cdn-PID
 }

 Triggerspec = { ; see Section 5.2.1
   type: Trigger-Type
   ? metadata.urls: [* URI]
   ? content.urls: [* URI]
   ? content.ccid: [* Ccid]
   ? metadata.patterns: [* Pattern-Match]
   ? content.patterns: [* Pattern-Match]
 }

 Trigger-Type = "preposition" / "invalidate"
    / "purge" ; see Section 5.2.2

 Trigger-Status = "pending" / "active" / "complete" / "processed"
    / "failed" / "cancelling" / "cancelled" ; see Section 5.2.3

 Pattern-Match = { ; see Section 5.2.4
   pattern: tstr
   ? case-sensitive: bool
   ? match-query-string: bool
 }

 Absolute-Time = number ; seconds since UNIX epoch (Section 5.2.5)

 Error-Description = { ; see Section 5.2.6
   error: Error-Code
   ? metadata.urls: [* URI]
   ? content.urls: [* URI]
   ? metadata.patterns: [* Pattern-Match]
   ? content.patterns: [* Pattern-Match]
   ? description: tstr
 }

 Error-Code = "emeta" / "econtent" / "eperm" / "ereject"
    / "ecdn" / "ecanceled"  ; see Section 5.2.7

 Ccid = tstr ; see RFC 8006

 Cdn-PID = tstr .regexp "AS[0-9]+:[0-9]+"

 URI = tstr
