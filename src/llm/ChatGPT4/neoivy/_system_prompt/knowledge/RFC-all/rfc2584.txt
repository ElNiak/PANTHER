RFC 2584              APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB               May 1999


1.  Introduction

   This document is a product of the SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group.
   It defines a MIB module for managing devices with HPR in IP networks
   capabilities.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

   o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The
        second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2478
        [5], RFC 2579 [6] and RFC 2580 [7].

   o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and
        RFC 1906 [10]. The third version of the message protocol is
        called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and
        RFC 2274 [12].

   o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [13].

   o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
        the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275
        [15].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

RFC 2584              APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB               May 1999


   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3.  Overview

   This document identifies a set of objects for monitoring the
   configuration and active characteristics of devices with HPR in IP
   network capabilities.  HPR is an enhancement to the Advanced Peer-
   to-Peer Network (APPN) architecture that provides fast data routing
   and improved session reliability.  APPN is the aspect of Systems
   Network Architecture (SNA) that supports peer-to-peer networking.
   APPN/HPR in IP Networks is a further enhancement to the APPN/HPR
   architecture, described in RFC 2353 [18].  It provides a method with
   which APPN/HPR nodes can communicate in IP networks.

   APPN management information is defined by the APPN MIB [19].  HPR
   management information is defined by the HPR MIB, RFC 2238 [20].

   Highlights of the management functions supported by the APPN/HPR in
   IP Networks MIB module include the following:

   o    A count of UDP packets sent with each type of APPN traffic on
        HPR/IP links.

   o    Monitoring and setting configuration parameters for the mappings
        between APPN traffic types on Type of Service (TOS) Precedence
        settings in the IP header.  Note that the TOS Precedence
        settings have been redefined in RFC 2474 [21] as the first three
        bits of the differentiated services code point (DSCP).

   This MIB module does not support:

   o    Configuration of IP addresses used for APPN ports or link
        stations.

3.1.  HPR/IP Values for Objects in the APPN MIB

   Ports and link stations are the APPN device's interface to the data
   link control (DLC), which provides the physical transport, or to
   another protocol, such as IP.  The APPN MIB identifies ports and link
   stations using IP as the transport with the following objects:



Clouston & Moore            Standards Track                     [Page 3]

RFC 2584              APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB               May 1999


   o    appnPortDlcType

   o    appnLsDlcType

   o    appnLsStatusDlcType

   These objects all have the syntax IANAifType, and the value 126,
   defined as "IP (for APPN HPR in IP networks)" shall be returned when
   they identify an HPR/IP port or link station.

   The IP address used for the port or link station is returned in the
   following objects:

   o    appnPortDlcLocalAddr

   o    appnLsLocalAddr

   o    appnLsRemoteAddr

   o    appnLsStatusLocalAddr

   o    appnLsStatusRemoteAddr

   These objects have the syntax DisplayableDlcAddress, defined in the
   APPN MIB as a textual convention to represent the address as an octet
   string of ASCII characters.

   The following two objects return object identifiers that tie port and
   link table entries in the APPN MIB to lower-layer MIB entries:

   o    appnPortSpecific

   o    appnLsSpecific

   Both objects should return a RowPointer to the ifEntry in the agent's
   ifTable for the physical interface associated with the local IP
   address for the port.  If the agent implements the IP-MIB (RFC 2011),
   this association between the IP address and the physical interface
   will be represented in the ipNetToMediaTable.

3.2.  APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB Structure

   The APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB module contains two groups of
   objects:

   o    hprIpMonitoringGroup - an object for counting outgoing HPR/IP
        traffic for each APPN traffic type




Clouston & Moore            Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 2584              APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB               May 1999


   o    hprIpConfigurationGroup - objects to represent TOS Precedence to
        APPN traffic type mappings

   These groups are described below in more detail.

3.2.1.  hprIpMonitoringGroup

   The hprIpMonitoringGroup group consists of the hprIpActiveLsTable.
   This table is indexed by the link station name and traffic type, and
   contains a counter for the number of UDP packets sent on a link
   station for that traffic type.

3.2.2.  hprIpConfigurationGroup

   The hprIpMonitoringGroup group consists of the following objects and
   tables:

   1) hprIpAppnPortTable

   This table supports reading and setting the default mapping between
   APPN traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for all link stations
   using a port.  This mapping may be overridden for individual link
   stations or individual connection networks.

   2) hprIpLsTable

   This table supports reading and setting the mappings between APPN
   traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for an individual link
   station and APPN traffic type.  If there is no entry in this table
   for a given link station and traffic type, then that link station
   inherits its mapping from its port.

   3) hprIpCnTable

   This table supports reading and setting the mapping between APPN
   traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for an individual
   connection network and traffic type.  If there is no entry in this
   table for a given connection network and traffic type, then that
   connection network inherits its mapping from its port.

5.  Security Considerations

   Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
   sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
   received SNMP requests and controlled access to management
   information SHOULD be employed in such environments.  An
   authentication protocol is defined in [12].  A protocol for access
   control is defined in [15].  It is a customer responsibility to
   properly set up access control for MIB access.



Clouston & Moore            Standards Track                    [Page 16]

RFC 2584              APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB               May 1999


   None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password, user
   data, or anything else that is particularly sensitive.  Some
   enterprises view their network configuration itself, as well as
   information about network usage and performance, as corporate assets;
   such enterprises may wish to restrict SNMP access to most of the
   objects in the MIB.

   The one read-write and four read-create objects in the MIB can affect
   network operations; it is recommended that SNMP access to these
   objects be restricted.  The five objects are:

   o    hprIpPortTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object immediately changes
        the mapping for all link stations using this port which do not
        have an entry to override the port value.  Improper mappings may
        cause delays or disruptions in the network.  For example, if
        APPN traffic type 'High' is mapped to IP TOS Precedence bits '
        001', network control traffic will have the same TOS precedence
        as bulk data traffic.  This may cause delays with session
        initializations, and timeouts on control sessions that could
        cause network outages.

   o    hprIpLsTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object has the potential for
        delay or disruption for this link station as described above
        with hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.

   o    hprIpLsRowStatus:  Setting this object to delete(6) causes this
        link station to revert to the default TOS Precedence mapping for
        its port.  The customized mapping for this link station will no
        longer be in effect.

   o    hprIpCnTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object has the potential for
        delay or disruption for this links created for this connection
        network as described above with hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.

   o    hprIpCnRowStatus:  Setting this object to delete(6) causes links
        created for this connection network to revert to the default TOS
        Precedence mapping for its port.  The customized mapping for
        this connection network will no longer be in effect.
