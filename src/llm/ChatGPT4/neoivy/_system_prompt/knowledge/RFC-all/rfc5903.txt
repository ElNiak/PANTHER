  Elliptic Curve Groups modulo a Prime (ECP Groups) for IKE and IKEv2

Abstract

   This document describes three Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
   groups for use in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and Internet Key
   Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocols in addition to previously
   defined groups.  These groups are based on modular arithmetic rather
   than binary arithmetic.  These groups are defined to align IKE and
   IKEv2 with other ECC implementations and standards, particularly NIST
   standards.  In addition, the curves defined here can provide more
   efficient implementation than previously defined ECC groups.  This
   document obsoletes RFC 4753.

RFC 5903              ECP Groups for IKE and IKEv2             June 2010


1.  Introduction

   This document describes default Diffie-Hellman groups for use in IKE
   and IKEv2 in addition to the Oakley Groups included in [IKE] and the
   additional groups defined since [IANA-IKE].  This document assumes
   that the reader is familiar with the IKE protocol and the concept of
   Oakley Groups, as defined in RFC 2409 [IKE].

   RFC 2409 [IKE] defines five standard Oakley Groups: three modular
   exponentiation groups and two elliptic curve groups over GF[2^N].
   One modular exponentiation group (768 bits - Oakley Group 1) is
   mandatory for all implementations to support, while the other four
   are optional.  Nineteen additional groups subsequently have been
   defined and assigned values by IANA.  All of these additional groups
   are optional.

   The purpose of this document is to expand the options available to
   implementers of elliptic curve groups by adding three ECP groups
   (elliptic curve groups modulo a prime).  The reasons for adding such
   groups include the following.

   - The groups proposed afford efficiency advantages in software
     applications since the underlying arithmetic is integer arithmetic
     modulo a prime rather than binary field arithmetic.  (Additional
     computational advantages for these groups are presented in [GMN].)

   - The groups proposed encourage alignment with other elliptic curve
     standards.  The proposed groups are among those standardized by
     NIST, the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG), ISO,
     and ANSI.  (See Section 5 for details.)

   - The groups proposed are capable of providing security consistent
     with the Advanced Encryption Standard [AES].

   In summary, due to the performance advantages of elliptic curve
   groups in IKE implementations and the need for further alignment with
   other standards, this document defines three elliptic curve groups
   based on modular arithmetic.

   These groups were originally proposed in [RFC4753].  This document
   changes the format of the shared key produced by a Diffie-Hellman
   exchange using these groups.  The shared key format used in this
   specification appeared earlier as an erratum to RFC 4753 [Err9], but
   some implementors of RFC 4753 were unaware of the erratum and did not
   implement the correction.  Implementations of RFC 4753 that
   incorporate the correction are interoperable with implementations of
   this specification.  However, there is a potential for
   interoperability problems between implementations of this

RFC 5903              ECP Groups for IKE and IKEv2             June 2010


   specification and implementations of RFC 4753 that did not implement
   the correction from the erratum.  These problems could be difficult
   to detect and analyze since both use the same code point but the
   secret value (which is probably not available to the trouble desk) is
   computed differently.  Where peers are not interoperable, the
   initiator will never receive a response and eventually times out.

   Section 9 provides more details of the changes from [RFC4753].  This
   document obsoletes RFC 4753 and addresses the erratum.

2.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST" and "SHOULD" that appear in this document are to
   be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Additional ECC Groups

   The notation adopted in RFC 2409 [IKE] is used below to describe the
   groups proposed.

3.1.  256-Bit Random ECP Group

   IKE and IKEv2 implementations SHOULD support an ECP group with the
   following characteristics.  The curve is based on the integers modulo
   the generalized Mersenne prime p given by:

                  p = 2^(256)-2^(224)+2^(192)+2^(96)-1

   The equation for the elliptic curve is:

                  y^2 = x^3 - 3 x + b

Group Order:
 FFFFFFFF 00000000 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF BCE6FAAD A7179E84 F3B9CAC2 FC632551

      The group was chosen verifiably at random using SHA-1 as specified
      in [IEEE-1363] from the seed:

3.3.  521-Bit Random ECP Group

   IKE and IKEv2 implementations SHOULD support an ECP group with the
   following characteristics.  The curve is based on the integers modulo
   the Mersenne prime p given by:

                  p = 2^(521)-1

4.  Security Considerations

   Since this document proposes groups for use within IKE and IKEv2,
   many of the security considerations contained within [IKE] and
   [IKEv2] apply here as well.

   The groups proposed in this document correspond to the symmetric key
   sizes 128 bits, 192 bits, and 256 bits.  This allows the IKE key
   exchange to offer security comparable with the AES algorithms [AES].

5.  Alignment with Other Standards

   The following table summarizes the appearance of these three elliptic
   curve groups in other standards.

   [ISO-15946-4].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated its registries of Diffie-Hellman groups for IKE in
   [IANA-IKE] and for IKEv2 in [IANA-IKEv2] to include the groups
   defined above.

   In [IANA-IKE], the groups appear as entries in the list of Diffie-
   Hellman groups given by Group Description (attribute class 4).





Fu & Solinas                  Informational                     [Page 7]

RFC 5903              ECP Groups for IKE and IKEv2             June 2010


   The descriptions are "256-bit random ECP group", "384-bit random ECP
   group", and "521-bit random ECP group".  In each case, the group type
   (attribute class 5) has the value 2 (ECP, elliptic curve group over
   GF[P]).

   In [IANA-IKEv2], the groups appear as entries in the list of IKEv2
   transform type values for Transform Type 4 (Diffie-Hellman groups).

   These entries in both [IANA-IKE] and [IANA-IKEv2] have been updated.
   The update consisted of changing the reference from [RFC4753] to this
   document.

7.  ECP Key Exchange Data Formats

   In an ECP key exchange, the Diffie-Hellman public value passed in a
   KE payload consists of two components, x and y, corresponding to the
   coordinates of an elliptic curve point.  Each component MUST have bit
   length as given in the following table.

      Diffie-Hellman group                component bit length
      ------------------------            --------------------

      256-bit Random ECP Group                   256
      384-bit Random ECP Group                   384
      521-bit Random ECP Group                   528

   This length is enforced, if necessary, by prepending the value with
   zeros.

   The Diffie-Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating the x
   and y values.

   The Diffie-Hellman shared secret value consists of the x value of the
   Diffie-Hellman common value.

   These formats should be regarded as specific to ECP curves and may
   not be applicable to EC2N (elliptic curve group over GF[2^N]) curves.

8.  Test Vectors

   The following are examples of the IKEv2 key exchange payload for each
   of the three groups specified in this document.

   We denote by g^n the scalar multiple of the point g by the integer n;
   it is another point on the curve.  In the literature, the scalar
   multiple is typically denoted ng; the notation g^n is used in order
   to conform to the notation used in [IKE] and [IKEv2].

8.1.  256-Bit Random ECP Group

   IANA assigned the ID value 19 to this Diffie-Hellman group.

   We suppose that the initiator's Diffie-Hellman private key is:

9.  Changes from RFC 4753

   Section 7 (ECP Key Exchange Data Formats) of [RFC4753] states that

      The Diffie-Hellman public value is obtained by concatenating the x
      and y values.

      The format of the Diffie-Hellman shared secret value is the same
      as that of the Diffie-Hellman public value.

   This document replaces the second of these two paragraphs with the
   following:

      The Diffie-Hellman shared secret value consists of the x value of
      the Diffie-Hellman common value.

   This change aligns the ECP key exchange format with that used in
   other standards.

   This change appeared earlier as an erratum to RFC 4753 [Err9].  This
   document obsoletes RFC 4753 and addresses the erratum.

   Section 8 (Test Vectors) of [RFC4753] provides three examples of
   Diffie-Hellman key agreement using the ECP groups.  This document
   changes the last paragraph of each subsection of Section 8 to reflect
   the new format.
