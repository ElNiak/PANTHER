1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it defines objects for managing IEEE 802.3 Medium
   Attachment Units (MAUs).

   This memo also includes a MIB module.  This MIB module extends the
   list of managed objects specified in the earlier version of this MIB
   module, RFC 2668 [RFC2668].

   Ethernet technology, as defined by the 802.3 Working Group of the
   IEEE, continues to evolve, with scalable increases in speed, new
   types of cabling and interfaces, and new features.  This evolution
   may require changes in the managed objects in order to reflect this
   new functionality.  This document, as with other documents issued by
   this working group, reflects a certain stage in the evolution of
   Ethernet technology.  In the future, this document might be revised,
   or new documents might be issued by the Ethernet Interfaces and Hub
   MIB Working Group, in order to reflect the evolution of Ethernet
   technology.

RFC 3636                     802.3 MAU MIB                September 2003


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview

   Instances of these object types represent attributes of an IEEE 802.3
   MAU.  Several types of MAUs are defined in the IEEE 802.3 CSMA/CD
   standard [IEEE802.3].  These MAUs may be connected to IEEE 802.3
   repeaters or to 802.3 (Ethernet-like) interfaces.  For convenience
   this document refers to these devices as "repeater MAUs" and
   "interface MAUs."

   The definitions presented here are based on Section 30.5, "Layer
   Management for 10 Mb/s, 100 Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s and 10 Gb/s Medium
   Attachment Units (MAUs)", Section 30.6, "Management for link Auto-
   Negotiation", and Annex 30A, "GDMO Specifications for 802.3 managed
   object classes" of IEEE Std. 802.3, 2002 edition [IEEE802.3], as
   amended by IEEE Std. 802.3ae-2002 [IEEE802.3ae].  That specification
   includes definitions for 10 Mb/s, 100 Mb/s, 1000 Mb/s and 10 Gb/s
   devices.  This specification is intended to serve the same purpose:
   to provide for management of all types of Ethernet/802.3 MAUs.

3.1.  Relationship to RFC 2668

   This MIB is intended to be a superset of that defined by RFC 2668
   [RFC2668].  This MIB includes all of the objects contained in that
   MIB, with new and updated definitions which provide support for
   additional capabilities.  Implementors are encouraged to support all
   applicable conformance groups in order to make the best use of the
   new functionality provided by this MIB.  The new and updated
   definitions provide management support for 10 Gb/s devices.

3.2.  Relationship to RFC 2239

   RFC 2668 was a replacement for RFC 2239 [RFC2239].  RFC 2668 defined
   a superset of that defined by RFC 2239, which contained all of the
   objects defined in RFC 2239, plus several new ones which provide
   additional capabilities.  The new objects provided management support
   for:

   o  management of 1000 Mb/s devices

   o  management of PAUSE negotiation

   o  management of remote fault status

3.3.  Relationship to RFC 1515

   RFC 2239 was a replacement for RFC 1515 [RFC1515].  RFC 2239 defined
   a superset of RFC 1515 which contained all of the objects defined in
   RFC 1515, plus several new ones which provided additional
   capabilities.  The new objects in RFC 2239 provided management
   support for:

   o  management of 100 Mb/s devices

   o  auto-negotiation on interface MAUs

   o  jack management

3.4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   It is assumed that an agent implementing this MIB will also implement
   (at least) the 'system' group defined in the SNMPv2 MIB [RFC3418].
   The following sections identify other MIBs that such an agent should
   implement.

3.4.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB.

   The sections of this document that define interface MAU-related
   objects specify an extension to the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  An
   agent implementing these interface-MAU related objects MUST also
   implement the relevant groups of the ifCompliance3 MODULE-COMPLIANCE
   statement of the Interface MIB.  The value of the object ifMauIfIndex
   is the same as the value of 'ifIndex' used to instantiate the
   interface to which the given MAU is connected.

   It is REQUIRED that an agent implementing the interface-MAU related
   objects in this MIB will also fully comply with the dot3Compliance2
   MODULE-COMPLIANCE statement of the Ethernet-like Interfaces MIB,



Flick                       Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 3636                     802.3 MAU MIB                September 2003


   [RFC3635].  Furthermore, when the interface-MAU related objects are
   used to manage a 10GBASE-W PHY -- i.e., when ifMauType is equal to
   dot3MauType10GigBaseW or any other 10GBASE-W variant -- then the
   agent MUST also support the Ethernet WAN Interface Sublayer (WIS) MIB
   [RFC3637] and must follow the interface layering model specified
   therein.  In that case the value of the object ifMauIfIndex is the
   same as the value of 'ifIndex' for the layer at the top of the stack,
   i.e., for the ifTable entry that has 'ifType' equal to
   ethernetCsmacd(6).  If the interface-MAU related objects are used to
   manage a PHY that allows the MAU type to be changed dynamically, then
   the agent SHALL create ifTable, ifStackTable, and ifInvStackTable
   entries that pertain to the WIS when ifMauDefaultType is changed to a
   10GBASEW variant (i.e., one of dot3MauType10GigBaseW,
   dot3MauType10GigBaseEW, dot3MauType10GigBaseLW, or
   dot3MauType10GigBaseSW) from any other type, and shall destroy the
   WIS-related entries when ifMauDefaultType is changed to a non-
   10GBASE-W type.  The agent SHALL also change the values of
   'ifConnectorPresent' and 'ifHighSpeed' in the ifTable entry indexed
   by ifMauIfIndex as specified in [RFC3635] and [RFC3637] when
   ifMauDefaultType is manipulated in this way but SHALL NOT otherwise
   alter that entry.

   (Note that repeater ports are not represented as interfaces in the
   Interface MIB.)

3.4.2.  Relationship to the 802.3 Repeater MIB

   The section of this document that defines repeater MAU-related
   objects specifies an extension to the 802.3 Repeater MIB defined in
   [RFC2108].  An agent implementing these repeater-MAU related objects
   MUST also comply with the snmpRptrModCompl compliance statement of
   the 802.3 Repeater MIB.

   The values of 'rpMauGroupIndex' and 'rpMauPortIndex' used to
   instantiate a repeater MAU variable SHALL be the same as the values
   of 'rptrPortGroupIndex' and 'rptrPortIndex' used to instantiate the
   port to which the given MAU is connected.

3.5.  Management of Internal MAUs

   In some situations, a MAU can be "internal" -- i.e., its
   functionality is implemented entirely within a device.  For example,
   a managed repeater may contain an internal repeater-MAU and/or an
   internal interface-MAU through which management communications
   originating on one of the repeater's external ports pass in order to
   reach the management agent associated with the repeater.  Such
   internal MAUs may or may not be managed.  If they are managed,
   objects describing their attributes should appear in the appropriate

                       - Added fiberLC jack type to JackType TC
                       - Extended ifMauTypeListBits with bits for
                         the 10 gigabit MAU types
                       - Added enumerations to ifMauMediaAvailable,
                         and updated its DESCRIPTION to reflect
                         behaviour at 10 Gb/s
                       - Added 64-bit version of ifMauFalseCarriers

                       support setting the value of this object to some
                       of the enumerated values.

                       The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in
                       a state other than one of the states 2 through
                       6.

                       The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.

                       A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully
                       functional, operates, and passes signals to its
                       attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                       its specification.

                       A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                       idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                       if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                       link type MAUs.  The state of
                       rpMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                       A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                       condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                       as though it were powered down or not connected.
                       The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                       rpMauJabberState and rpMauMediaAvailable objects
                       when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                       state will remove power from the AUI.

                       Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                       resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                       power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                       second would.  The agent is not required to
                       return the value reset (6).

                       Setting this variable to the value
                       operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                       causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                       except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI

                       10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                       the link test fail state/low light function.
                       For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                       this indicates whether or not loopback is
                       detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                       attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                       AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                       The value other(1) is returned if the
                       mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 11.

                       The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                       reset, the value of this attribute will be
                       unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For
                       these MAUs loopback will be tested on each
                       transmission during which no collision is
                       detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO
                       returns to IDL after a transmission and there
                       has been no collision during the transmission
                       then loopback will be detected.  The value of
                       this attribute will only change during
                       non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                       10BASE-FP MAUs.

                       For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                       match the states within the respective link
                       integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                       24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [IEEE802.3].
                       Any MAU which implements management of
                       auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                       indication to remote fault.

                       The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                       light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                       notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                       or no loopback.

                       The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                       has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                       This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                       End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                       faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                       The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                       and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                       remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                       is identified in the remote signaling protocol.

                       The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                       invalid signal has been received from the other
                       end of the link.  invalidSignal(6) applies only
                       to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                       Where an IEEE Std 802.3-2002 clause 22 MII
                       is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                       (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                       maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                       zero in the link status bit (reference section
                       22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                       notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                       takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                       Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                       Auto-Negotiation will map the received Remote

                       offline(10), Link Failure to remoteFault(5) and

                       of the enumerated values.

                       The value other(1) is returned if the MAU is in

                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.

                       A MAU in the operational(3) state is fully

                       attached DTE or repeater port in accordance to
                       its specification.

                       A MAU in standby(4) state forces DI and CI to
                       idle and the media transmitter to idle or fault,
                       if supported.  Standby(4) mode only applies to
                       link type MAUs.  The state of
                       ifMauMediaAvailable is unaffected.

                       A MAU in shutdown(5) state assumes the same
                       condition on DI, CI, and the media transmitter
                       as though it were powered down or not connected.
                       The MAU MAY return other(1) value for the
                       ifMauJabberState and ifMauMediaAvailable objects
                       when it is in this state.  For an AUI, this
                       state will remove power from the AUI.

                       Setting this variable to the value reset(6)
                       resets the MAU in the same manner as a
                       power-off, power-on cycle of at least one-half
                       second would.  The agent is not required to
                       return the value reset (6).

                       Setting this variable to the value
                       operational(3), standby(4), or shutdown(5)
                       causes the MAU to assume the respective state
                       except that setting a mixing-type MAU or an AUI
                       to standby(4) will cause the MAU to enter the
                       shutdown state."

                       10BASE-T, 10BASE-F) then this is equivalent to
                       the link test fail state/low light function.
                       For an AUI or a coax (including broadband) MAU
                       this indicates whether or not loopback is
                       detected on the DI circuit.  The value of this
                       attribute persists between packets for MAU types
                       AUI, 10BASE5, 10BASE2, 10BROAD36, and 10BASE-FP.

                       The value other(1) is returned if the
                       mediaAvailable state is not one of 2 through 18.

                       The value unknown(2) is returned when the MAU's
                       true state is unknown; for example, when it is
                       being initialized.  At power-up or following a
                       reset, the value of this attribute will be
                       unknown for AUI, coax, and 10BASE-FP MAUs.  For

                       transmission during which no collision is
                       detected.  If DI is receiving input when DO

                       this attribute will only change during
                       non-collided transmissions for AUI, coax, and
                       10BASE-FP MAUs.

                       For 100Mbps and 1000Mbps MAUs, the enumerations
                       match the states within the respective link
                       integrity state diagrams, fig 32-16, 23-12 and
                       24-15 of sections 32, 23 and 24 of [IEEE802.3].
                       Any MAU which implements management of
                       auto-negotiation will map remote fault
                       indication to remote fault.

                       The value available(3) indicates that the link,
                       light, or loopback is normal.  The value
                       notAvailable(4) indicates link loss, low light,
                       or no loopback.

                       The value remoteFault(5) indicates that a fault
                       has been detected at the remote end of the link.
                       This value applies to 10BASE-FB, 100BASE-T4 Far
                       End Fault Indication and non-specified remote
                       faults from a system running auto-negotiation.
                       The values remoteJabber(7), remoteLinkLoss(8),
                       and remoteTest(9) SHOULD be used instead of
                       remoteFault(5) where the reason for remote fault
                       is identified in the remote signaling protocol.
                       The value invalidSignal(6) indicates that an
                       invalid signal has been received from the other
                       end of the link.  invalidSignal(6) applies only
                       to MAUs of type 10BASE-FB.

                       Where an IEEE Std 802.3-2002 clause 22 MII
                       is present, a logic one in the remote fault bit
                       (reference section 22.2.4.2.8 of that document)
                       maps to the value remoteFault(5), and a logic
                       zero in the link status bit (reference section
                       22.2.4.2.10 of that document) maps to the value
                       notAvailable(4).  The value notAvailable(4)
                       takes precedence over the value remoteFault(5).

                       Any MAU that implements management of clause 37
                       Auto-Negotiation will map the received RF1 and
                       RF2 bit values for Offline to offline(10), Link
                       Failure to remoteFault(5) and Auto-Negotiation
                       Error to autoNegError(11).

                       For 10 Gb/s, the enumerations map to the states
                       within the Reconciliation Sublayer state diagram

                       If auto-negotiation is implemented and enabled
                       for this MAU, the operational type of the MAU
                       is determined by auto-negotiation, and the value
                       of this object denotes the type to which the MAU
                       will automatically revert if/when
                       auto-negotiation is later disabled.

                       NOTE TO IMPLEMENTORS:  It may be necessary to
                       provide for underlying hardware implementations
                       which do not follow the exact behavior specified
                       above.  In particular, when
                       ifMauAutoNegAdminStatus transitions from enabled
                       to disabled, the agent implementation MUST
                       ensure that the operational type of the MAU (as
                       reported by ifMauType) correctly transitions to
                       the value specified by this object, rather than

                       A value that uniquely identifies the set of
                       capabilities of the local auto-negotiation
                       entity.  The value is a sum which initially
                       takes the value zero.  Then, for each capability
                       of this interface, 2 raised to the power noted
                       below is added to the sum. For example, an
                       interface which has the capability to support
                       only 100Base-TX half duplex would have a value
                       of 32768 (2**15).  In contrast, an interface
                       which supports both 100Base-TX half duplex and
                       and 100Base-TX full duplex would have a value of
                       98304 ((2**15) + (2**16)).

                       The powers of 2 assigned to the capabilities are
                       these:

                       Power   Capability
                         0       other or unknown

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Setting these objects can
   have a serious effect on the operation of the network, including:

   o  enabling or disabling a MAU

   o  changing a MAU's default type

   o  enabling, disabling or restarting autonegotiation

   o  modifying the capabilities that a MAU advertizes during
      autonegotiation.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

RFC 3636                     802.3 MAU MIB                September 2003


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  In some environments it may
   be undesirable to allow unauthorized parties to access statistics or
   status information about individual links in a network.  It is thus
   important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is recommended that the implementors consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section
   8), including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
   (for authentication and privacy).

   Furthermore, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
