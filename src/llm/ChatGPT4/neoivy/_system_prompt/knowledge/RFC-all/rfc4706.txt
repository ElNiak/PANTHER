1.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to Section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

2.  Overview

   This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
   use with network management protocols in the Internet community for
   the purpose of managing ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

   The MIB module described in RFC 2662 [RFC2662] describes objects used
   for managing Asymmetric Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per
   [T1E1.413], [G.992.1], and [G.992.2].  These object descriptions are
   based upon the specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations
   Channel (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute
   (ANSI) T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International Telecommunication
   Union (ITU-T) G.992.1 [G.992.1] and G.992.2 [G.992.2].

   This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662], but rather
   provides a more comprehensive management model that includes the
   ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies per G.992.3, G.992.4, and G.992.5
   ([G.992.3], [G.992.4], and [G.992.5] respectively).  In addition,
   objects have been added to improve the management of ADSL, ADSL2, and
   ADSL2+ lines.

   Additionally, the management framework for New Generation ADSL lines
   specified [TR-90] by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum (DSLF) has
   been taken into consideration.  That framework is based on ITU-T
   G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] as well as on two amendments:
   ([G.997.1am1] and [G.997.1am2]).  This document refers to all three
   documents as G.997.1.  That is, a MIB attribute whose REFERENCE
   section provides a paragraph number in ITU-T G.997.1 is actually
   originated from either G.997.1 [G.997.1] or one of its amendment
   documents.

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


   Note that the revised ITU-T G.997.1 standard also refers to the next
   generation of VDSL technology, known as VDSL2, as per ITU-T G.993.2
   [G.993.2].  However, managing VDSL2 lines is currently beyond the
   scope of this document.

   The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2 transmission,
   as discussed in the IANA Considerations section of this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.1.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section outlines the relationship of this MIB module with other
   MIB modules described in RFCs.  Specifically, IF-MIB as presented in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863] is discussed.

2.1.1.  General IF-MIB Integration (RFC 2863)

   The ADSL2 Line MIB specifies the detailed attributes of a data
   interface.  As such, it needs to integrate with RFC 2863 [RFC2863].
   The IANA has assigned the following ifTypes, which may be applicable
   for ADSL lines:

   IANAifType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       ...
   SYNTAX INTEGER {
       ...
       channel(70),     -- Channel
       adsl(94),        -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop
       ...
       interleave(124), -- Interleaved Channel
       fast(125),       -- Fast Channel
       ...
       adsl2plus(238),  -- Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop Version 2,
                           Version 2 Plus, and all variants
       ...
       }

   ADSL lines that are identified with ifType=adsl(94) MUST be managed
   with the MIB specified by RFC 2662.  ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines
   identified with ifType=adsl2plus(238) MUST be managed with the MIB
   specified by this document.







Morgenstern, et al.         Standards Track                     [Page 4]

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


   In any case, the SNMP agent may use either ifType=interleave(124) or
   fast(125) for each channel, e.g., depending on whether or not it is
   capable of using an interleaver on that channel.  It may use the
   ifType=channel(70) when all channels are capable of using an
   interleaver (e.g., for ADSL2 XTUs).

   Note that the ifFixedLengthGroup from RFC 2863 [RFC2863] MUST be
   supported and that the ifRcvAddressGroup does not apply to this MIB
   module.

2.1.2.  Usage of ifTable

   The MIB branch identified by ifType contains tables appropriate for
   the interface types described above.  Most such tables extend the
   ifEntry table and are indexed by ifIndex.  For interfaces in systems
   implementing this MIB module, those table entries indexed by ifIndex
   MUST be persistent.

   The following attributes are part of the mandatory
   ifGeneralInformationGroup in the Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] and are not
   duplicated in the ADSL2 Line MIB.

   ===================================================================

      ifIndex               Interface index.

      ifDescr               See interfaces MIB.

      ifType                adsl2plus(238) or
                            channel(70) or
                            interleave(124) or
                            fast(125).

      ifSpeed               Set as appropriate.

      ifPhysAddress         This object MUST have an octet string
                            with zero length.

      ifAdminStatus         See interfaces MIB.

      ifOperStatus          See interfaces MIB.

      ifLastChange          See interfaces MIB.

      ifName                See interfaces MIB.

      ifAlias               See interfaces MIB.

2.2.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA has allocated ifType=adsl2plus(238) for Asymmetric Digital
   Subscriber Loop Version 2.  A separate ifType number was necessary to
   distinguish between ADSL lines that are managed with the RFC 2662
   management model and ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines managed with the
   model defined in this document.

   Also, the IANA has assigned transmission number 238 to the
   ADSL2-LINE-MIB module.

   An assignment was in fact done when RFC 2662 was published, but as
   this MIB does not obsolete RFC 2662, it required a new assignment
   from IANA.

2.3.  Conventions Used in the MIB Module

2.3.1.  Naming Conventions

      ATU    ADSL Transceiver Unit
      ATU-C  ATU at the Central office end (i.e., network operator).
      ATU-R  ATU at the Remote end (i.e., subscriber end of the loop).
      XTU    A terminal unit; either an ATU-C or an ATU-R.

2.3.2.  Textual Conventions

   The following textual conventions are defined to reflect the line
   topology in the MIB module (further discussed in the following
   section), the various transmission modes, power states,
   synchronization states, possible values for various configuration
   parameters, status parameters, and other parameter types.

   o  Adsl2Unit:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify each unit in the
      ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.  It mirrors the EOC addressing mechanism:

      atuc(1)           - Central office ADSL transceiver unit (ATU-C).
      atur(2)           - Remote ADSL transceiver unit (ATU-R).


   o  Adsl2Direction:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify a transmission
      direction in an ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ link.  Upstream direction is a
      transmission from the remote end (ATU-R) towards the central
      office end (ATU-C), while downstream direction is a transmission
      from the ATU-C towards the ATU-R.

      upstream(1)        - Transmission from the ATU-R to the ATU-C.
      downstream(2)      - Transmission from the ATU-C to the ATU-R.

   o  Adsl2TransmissionModeType:

      Attributes with this syntax reference the list of possible
      transmission modes for ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+.

      Specified as a BITS construct, there are currently a few dozen
      transmission modes in the list.

   o  Adsl2RaMode:

      Attributes with this syntax reference if and how Rate-Adaptive
      synchronization is being used on the respective ADSL/ADSL2 or
      ADSL2+ link:

         manual(1)    - No Rate-Adaptation.  The initialization process
                        attempts to synchronize to a specified rate.
         raInit(2)    - Rate-Adaptation during initialization process
                        only, which attempts to synchronize to a rate
                        between minimum and maximum specified values.

         dynamicRa(3) - Dynamic Rate-Adaptation during initialization
                        process as well as during SHOWTIME.

   o  Adsl2InitResult:

      Attributes with this syntax reference the recent result of a full
      initialization attempt:

      noFail(0)              - Successful initialization.
      configError(1)         - Configuration failure.
      configNotFeasible(2)   - Configuration details not supported.
      commFail(3)            - Communication failure.
      noPeerAtu(4)           - Peer ADSL Transceiver Unit (ATU) not
                               detected.
      otherCause(5)          - Other initialization failure reason.

   o  Adsl2OperationModes:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify an ADSL mode, which
      is a category associated with each transmission mode defined for
      the ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ link.  Part of the line configuration
      profile depends on the ADSL Mode:

      Specified as an enumeration construct, there are currently a few
      dozen transmission modes in the list.

   o  Adsl2PowerMngState:

      Attributes with this syntax uniquely identify each power
      management state defined for the ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ link:

         l0(1)       - L0 - Full power management state.
         l1(2)       - L1 - Low power management state (for G.992.2).
         l2(3)       - L2 - Low power management state (for G.992.3,
                            G.992.4, and G.992.5).
         l3(4)       - L3 - Idle power management state.

   o  Adsl2ConfPmsForce:

      Attributes with this syntax are configuration parameters that
      reference the desired power management state for the ADSL/ADSL2 or
      ADSL2+ link:

         l3toL0(0)        - Perform a transition from L3 to L0 (Full
                            power management state).
         l0toL2(2)        - Perform a transition from L0 to L2 (Low
                            power management state).

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


         l0orL2toL3(3)    - Perform a transition into L3 (Idle power
                            management state).

      Attributes with this syntax are configuration parameters that
      reference the power modes/states into which the ATU-C or ATU-R may
      autonomously transit.

      This is a BITS structure that allows control of the following
      transit options:

         allowTransitionsToIdle(0)     - XTU may autonomously transit
                                         to idle (L3) state.
         allowTransitionsToLowPower(1) - XTU may autonomously transit
                                         to low-power (L2) state.

   o  Adsl2LineLdsf:

      Attributes with this syntax are configuration parameters that
      control the Loop Diagnostic mode for the ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+
      link:

         inhibit(0)        - Inhibit Loop Diagnostic mode.
         force(1)          - Force/Initiate Loop Diagnostic mode.

   o  Adsl2LdsfResult:

      Attributes with this syntax are status parameters that report the
      result of the recent Loop Diagnostic mode issued for the
      ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ link:

         none(1)           - The default value, in case loop diagnostics
                             mode forced (LDSF) was never requested for
                             the associated line.
         success(2)        - The recent command completed
                             successfully.
         inProgress(3)     - The Loop Diagnostics process is in
                             progress.
         unsupported(4)    - The NE or the line card doesn't support
                             LDSF.
         cannotRun(5)      - The NE cannot initiate the command, due
                             to a nonspecific reason.
         aborted(6)        - The Loop Diagnostics process aborted.
         failed(7)         - The Loop Diagnostics process failed.
         illegalMode(8)    - The NE cannot initiate the command, due
                             to the specific mode of the relevant
                             line.

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


         adminUp(9)        - The NE cannot initiate the command because
                             the relevant line is administratively 'Up'.
         tableFull(10)     - The NE cannot initiate the command, due
                             to reaching the maximum number of rows
                             in the results table.
         noResources(11)   - The NE cannot initiate the command, due
                             to lack of internal memory resources.

   o  Adsl2SymbolProtection:

      Attributes with this syntax are configuration parameters that
      reference the minimum-length impulse noise protection (INP) in
      terms of number of symbols:

         noProtection(1)     - INP not required.
         halfSymbol(2)       - INP length = 1/2 symbol.

2.6.  Line Topology

   An ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ Line consists of two units: ATU-C (the
   central office termination unit) and ATU-R (the remote termination
   unit).  There are up to 4 channels, each carrying an independent
   information flow, as shown in the figure below.

2.7.  Counters, Interval Buckets, and Thresholds

2.7.1.  Counters Managed

   There are various types of counters specified in this MIB.  Each
   counter refers either to the whole ADSL/ADSL2/ADSL2+ line, to one of
   the XTU entities, or to one of the bearer channels.

   o  On the whole line level

   For full initializations, failed full initializations, short
   initializations, and failed short initializations, there are event
   counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s)
   of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day
   interval-counter(s).  Each current 15-minute "failed" event bucket
   has an associated threshold notification.

   o  On the XTU level

   For the LOS Seconds, ES, SES, FEC seconds, and UAS, there are event
   counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96 15-minute history bucket(s)
   of "interval-counters", as well as current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day
   interval-counter(s).  Each current 15-minute event bucket has an
   associated threshold notification.






Morgenstern, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 18]

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


   o  On the bearer channel level

   For the coding violations (CRC anomalies) and corrected blocks (i.e.,
   FEC events), there are event counters, current 15-minute and 0 to 96
   15-minute history bucket(s) of "interval-counters", as well as
   current and 0 to 30 previous 1-day interval-counter(s).  Each current
   15-minute event bucket has an associated threshold notification.

2.7.2.  Minimum Number of Buckets

   Although it is possible to support up to 96 15-minute history buckets
   of "interval-counters", systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   practically support at least 16 buckets, as specified in ITU-T
   G.997.1, paragraph 7.2.7.2.

   Similarly, it is possible to support up to 30 previous 1-day
   "interval-counters", but systems implementing this MIB module SHOULD
   support at least 1 previous-day bucket.

2.7.3.  Interval Buckets Initialization

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure a fixed relationship
   between the start of a 15-minute interval and any wall clock;
   however, some implementations may align the 15-minute intervals with
   quarter hours.  Likewise, an implementation may choose to align one
   day intervals with the start of a day.

   Counters are not reset when an XTU is reinitialized, only when the
   agent is reset or reinitialized (or under specific request outside
   the scope of this MIB module).

2.7.4.  Interval Buckets Validity

   As in RFC 3593 [RFC3593] and RFC 2662 [RFC2662], in case the data for
   an interval is suspect or known to be invalid, the agent MUST report
   the interval as invalid.  If the current 15-minute event bucket is
   determined to be invalid, the element management system SHOULD ignore
   its content, and the agent MUST NOT generate notifications based upon
   the value of the event bucket.

   A valid 15-minute event bucket SHOULD usually count the events for
   exactly 15 minutes.  Similarly, a valid 1-day event bucket SHOULD
   usually count the events for exactly 24 hours.  However, the
   following scenarios are exceptional:

   1) For implementations that align the 15-minute intervals with
      quarter hours, and the 1-day intervals with start of a day, the
      management system may still start the PM process not aligned with
      the wall clock.  Such a management system may wish to retrieve
      even partial information for the first event buckets, rather than
      declaring them all as invalid.

   2) For an event bucket that suffered relatively short outages, the
      management system may wish to retrieve the available PM outcomes,
      rather than declare the whole event bucket as invalid.  This is
      more important for 1-day event buckets.

   3) An event bucket may be shorter or longer than the formal duration
      if a clock adjustment was performed during the interval.

   This MIB allows supporting the exceptional scenarios described above
   by reporting the actual Monitoring Time of a monitoring interval.
   This parameter is relevant only for Valid intervals, but is useful
   for these exceptional scenarios:

   a) The management system MAY still declare a partial PM interval as
      Valid and report the actual number of seconds the interval lasted.

   b) If the interval was shortened or extended due to clock
      corrections, the management system SHOULD report the actual number
      of seconds the interval lasted, besides reporting that the
      interval is Valid.

2.8.  Profiles

   As a managed node can handle a large number of XTUs, (e.g., hundreds
   or perhaps thousands of lines), provisioning every parameter on every
   XTU may become burdensome.  Moreover, most lines are provisioned
   identically with the same set of parameters.  To simplify the
   provisioning process, this MIB module makes use of profiles and
   templates.

   A configuration profile is a set of parameters that can be shared by
   multiple entities.  There are configuration profiles to address the
   line-level provisioning, and another type of profile that addresses
   the channel-level provisioning parameters.

   A configuration template is actually a profile-of-profiles.  That is,
   a template is comprised of one line configuration profile and one or
   more channel configuration profiles.  A template provides the
   complete configuration of a line.  The same configuration can be
   shared by multiple lines.

   Similarly to the configuration profiles and templates, this MIB
   module makes use of templates and profiles for specifying the alarm
   thresholds associated with performance parameters.  This allows
   provisioning multiple lines with the same criteria for generating
   threshold crossing notifications.

   The following paragraphs describe templates and profiles used in this
   MIB module

2.8.1.  Configuration Profiles and Templates

   o  Line Configuration Profiles - Line configuration profiles contain
      parameters for configuring the low layer of ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+
      lines.  They are defined in the adsl2LineConfProfTable.

      The line configuration includes issues such as the specific
      ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ modes to enable on the respective line, power
      spectrum parameters, rate adaptation criteria, and SNR margin-
      related parameters.  A subset of the line configuration parameters
      depends upon the specific ADSL Mode allowed (i.e., Does the
      profile allow ADSL, ADSL2, and/or ADSL2+) as well as what
      annex/annexes of the standard are allowed.  This is the reason a
      line profile MUST include one or more mode-specific extensions.

   o  Channel Configuration Profiles - Channel configuration profiles
      contain parameters for configuring bearer channels over the
      ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines.  They are sometimes considered the
      service layer configuration of the ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ lines.
      They are defined in the adsl2ChConfProfTable.

      The channel configuration includes issues such as the desired
      minimum and maximum rate on each traffic flow direction and
      impulse noise protection parameters.

   o  Line Configuration Templates - Line configuration templates allow
      combining line configuration profiles and channel configuration
      profiles to a comprehensive configuration of the ADSL/ADSL2 and
      ADSL2+ line.  They are defined in the adsl2LineConfTemplateTable.

      The line configuration template includes one index (OID) of a line
      configuration profile and one to four indexes of channel
      configuration profiles.  The template also addresses the issue of
      distributing the excess available data rate on each traffic flow
      direction (i.e., the data rate left after each channel is
      allocated a data rate to satisfy its minimum requested data rate)
      among the various channels.

2.8.2.  Alarm Configuration Profiles and Templates

   o  Line Alarm Configuration Profiles - Line-level Alarm configuration
      profiles contain the threshold values for Performance Monitoring
      (PM) parameters, counted either on the whole line level or on an
      XTU level.  Thresholds are required only for failures and
      anomalies, e.g., there are thresholds for failed initializations
      and LOS seconds, but not for the aggregate number of full
      initializations.  These profiles are defined in the
      adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileTable.

   o  Channel Alarm Configuration Profiles - Channel-level Alarm
      configuration profiles contain the threshold values for PM
      parameters counted on a bearer channel level.  Thresholds are
      defined for two types of anomalies: corrected blocks and coding
      violations.  These profiles are defined in the
      adsl2ChAlarmConfProfileTable.

   o  Line Alarm Configuration Templates - Line Alarm configuration
      templates allow combining line-level alarm configuration profiles
      and channel-level alarm configuration profiles to a comprehensive
      configuration of the PM thresholds for ADSL/ADSL2 and ADSL2+ line.
      They are defined in the adsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable.

      The line alarm configuration template includes one index (OID) of
      a line-level alarm configuration profile and one to four indexes
      of channel-level alarm configuration profiles.

2.8.3.  Managing Profiles and Templates

   The index value for each profile and template is a locally-unique,
   administratively assigned name having the textual convention
   'SnmpAdminString' (RFC 3411 [RFC3411]).

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   configuration template (e.g., adsl2LConfTempTemplateName = 'silver')
   by setting its adsl2LineCnfgTemplate objects to the value of this
   template.

   One or more lines may be configured to share parameters of a single
   Alarm configuration template (e.g., adsl2LAlarmConfTempTemplateName =
   'silver') by setting its adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate objects to the
   value of this template.

   Before a template can be deleted or taken out of service, it MUST
   first be unreferenced from all associated lines.  Implementations MAY
   also reject template modification while it is associated with any
   line.



Morgenstern, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 22]

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


   Before a profile can be deleted or taken out of service, it MUST
   first be unreferenced from all associated templates.  Implementations
   MAY also reject profile modification while it is referenced by any
   template.

   Implementations MUST provide a default profile whose name is 'DEFVAL'
   for each profile and template type.  The values of the associated
   parameters will be vendor-specific unless otherwise indicated in this
   document.  Before a line's templates have been set, these templates
   will be automatically used by setting adsl2LineCnfgTemplate and
   adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate to 'DEFVAL' where appropriate.  This
   default profile name, 'DEFVAL', is considered reserved in the context
   of profiles and templates defined in this MIB module.

   Profiles and templates are created, assigned, and deleted dynamically
   using the profile name and profile row status in each of the profile
   tables.

   If the implementation allows modifying a profile or template while it
   is associated with a line, then such changes MUST take effect
   immediately.  These changes MAY result in a restart (hard reset or
   soft restart) of the units on the line.

2.8.4.  Managing Multiple Bearer Channels

   The number of bearer channels is configured by setting the template
   attributes adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile,
   adsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, and
   adsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile and then assigning that template to a
   DSL line using the adsl2LineCnfgTemplate attribute.  When the number
   of bearer channels for a DSL line changes, the SNMP agent will
   automatically create or destroy rows in channel-related tables
   associated with that line.  For example, when a DSL line is operating
   with one bearer channel, there will be zero rows in channel-related
   tables for channels two, three, and four.  The SNMP agent MUST create
   and destroy channel-related rows as follows:

   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      higher number, the SNMP agent will automatically create rows in
      the adsl2ChannelStatusTable, and adsl2PMChCurrTable tables for
      that line.

   o  When the number of bearer channels for a DSL line changes to a
      lower number, the SNMP agent will automatically destroy rows in
      the adsl2ChannelStatusTable, adsl2PMChCurrTable,
      adsl2PMChHist15MinTable, and adsl2PMChHist1DTable tables for that
      line.

2.9.  Notifications

   The ability to generate the SNMP notifications coldStart/warmStart
   (per [RFC3418]), which are per agent (e.g., per Digital Subscriber
   Line Access Multiplexer, or DSLAM, in such a device), and
   linkUp/linkDown (per [RFC2863]), which are per interface (i.e.,
   ADSL/ADSL2 or ADSL2+ line), is REQUIRED.

   A linkDown notification MAY be generated whenever any of ES, SES, CRC
   Anomaly, LOS, LOF, or UAS event occurs.  The corresponding linkUp
   notification MAY be sent when all link failure conditions are
   cleared.

   The notifications defined in this MIB module are for status change
   (e.g., initialization failure) and for the threshold crossings
   associated with the following events: full initialization failures,
   short initialization failures, ES, SES, FEC Seconds, LOS Seconds,
   UAS, FEC Seconds, FEC events, and CRC anomalies.  Each threshold has
   its own enable/threshold value.  When that value is 0, the
   notification is disabled.

   The adsl2LineStatusAtur and adsl2LineStatusAtuc are bitmasks
   representing all outstanding error conditions associated with the
   ATU-R and ATU-C (respectively).  Note that since the ATU-R status is
   obtained via the EOC, this information may be unavailable in case the
   ATU-R is unreachable via EOC during a line error condition.
   Therefore, not all conditions may always be included in its current
   status.  Notifications corresponding to the bit fields in those two
   status objects are defined.

   Note that there are other status parameters that refer to the ATU-R
   (e.g., downstream line attenuation).  Those parameters also depend on
   the availability of EOC between the ATU-C and the ATU-R.

   A threshold notification occurs whenever the corresponding current
   15-minute interval error counter becomes equal to or exceeds the
   threshold value.  Only one notification SHOULD be sent per interval
   per interface.  Since the current 15-minute counter is reset to 0
   every 15 minutes, if the condition persists, the notification may
   recur as often as every 15 minutes.  For example, to get a
   notification whenever a "loss of" event occurs (but at most once
   every 15 minutes), set the corresponding threshold to 1.  The agent
   will generate a notification when the event originally occurs.

   Notifications, other than the threshold notifications listed above,
   SHOULD be rate-limited (throttled) such that there is an
   implementation-specific gap between the generation of consecutive
   notifications of the same event.  When notifications are rate-



Morgenstern, et al.         Standards Track                    [Page 24]

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


   limited, they are dropped and not queued for sending at a future
   time.  This is intended to be a general rate-limiting statement for
   notifications that otherwise have no explicit rate-limiting
   assertions in this document.

   Note that the Network Management System, or NMS, may receive a
   linkDown notification, as well, if enabled (via
   ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable [RFC2863]).  At the beginning of the next 15
   minute interval, the counter is reset.  When the first second goes by
   and the event occurs, the current interval bucket will be 1, which
   equals the threshold, and the notification will be sent again.

      DESCRIPTION
           "
            This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB)
            module for use with network management protocols in the
            Internet community for the purpose of managing ADSL, ADSL2,
            and ADSL2+ lines.  The MIB module described in RFC 2662
            [RFC2662] describes objects used for managing Asymmetric
            Bit-Rate DSL (ADSL) interfaces per [T1E1.413], [G.992.1],
            and [G.992.2].  These object descriptions are based upon the
            specifications for the ADSL Embedded Operations Channel
            (EOC) as defined in American National Standards Institute
            (ANSI) T1E1.413/1995 [T1E1.413] and International
            Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) G.992.1  [G.992.1] and
            G.992.2 [G.992.2].

            This document does not obsolete RFC 2662 [RFC2662], but
            rather provides a more comprehensive management model that
            includes the ADSL2 and ADSL2+ technologies per G.992.3,
            G.992.4, and G.992.5 ([G.992.3], [G.992.4], and [G.992.5],
            respectively).  In addition, objects have been added to
            improve the management of ADSL, ADSL2, and ADSL2+ lines.

           Additionally, the management framework for New Generation
           ADSL lines specified by the Digital Subscriber Line Forum
           (DSLF) has been taken into consideration [TR-90].  That
           framework is based on ITU-T G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] as
           well as two amendments: [G.997.1am1] and [G.997.1am2].

           Note that the revised ITU-T G.997.1 standard also refers to
           the next generation of VDSL technology, known as VDSL2, per
           ITU-T G.993.2 [G.993.2].  However, managing VDSL2 lines is
           currently beyond the scope of this document.

           The MIB module is located in the MIB tree under MIB 2
           transmission, as discussed in the IANA Considerations section
           of this document.

           Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2006).  This version of
           this MIB module is part of RFC 4706: see the RFC itself for
           full legal notices."

              of a DELT.
          2.  This table also holds parameters obtained at line
              initialization time.
          3.  The rows in this table are volatile; that is, they are
              lost if the SNMP agent is rebooted.
          4.  Due to the large OCTET STRING attributes in this table,
              the worst case memory requirements for this table are
              very high.  The manager may use the row status attribute
              of this table to delete rows in order to reclaim memory.
          5.  The manager may create rows in this table.  The SNMP
              agent may create rows in this table.  Only the manager
              may delete rows in this table.
          6.  The maximum number of rows allowable in this table is
              indicated by the scalar attribute
              adsl2ScalarSCMaxInterfaces.

              The number of rows available in this table is indicated
              by the scalar attribute adsl2ScalarSCAvailInterfaces.
          7.  The SNMP agent is permitted to create rows in this table
              when a DELT completes successfully or when line
              initialization occurs.  It is not mandatory for the SNMP
              agent to create rows in this table; hence, it may be
              necessary for the manager to create rows in this table
              before any results can be stored.
          8.  If the manager attempts to create a row in this table
              and there are no more rows available, the creation
              attempt will fail, and the response to the SNMP SET PDU
              will contain the error noCreation(11).
          9.  If the SNMP agent attempts to create a row in this table
              and there are no more rows available, the creation
              attempt will fail, and the attribute
              adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason will indicate the
              reason for the failure.  The failure reason will be either
              tableFull(10) or noResources(11).
          10. An example of use of this table is as follows:
              Step 1. : The DELT is started by setting the
                      : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from inhibit to force.
              Step 2. : The DELT completes, and valid data is
                      : available.
              Step 3. : The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the
                      : results will be stored does not yet exist so
                      : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
              Step 4. : Due to a low memory condition, a row in the
                      : adsl2SCStatusTable table cannot be created at
                      : this time.
              Step 5. : The reason for the failure, tableFull(10), is
                      : indicated in the adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReason
                      : attribute.
          11. Another example of use of this table is as follows :
              Step 1. : The DELT is started by setting the
                      : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf from inhibit to force.
              Step 2. : The DELT completes and valid data is
                      : available.
              Step 3. : The row in the adsl2SCStatusTable where the
                      : results will be stored does not yet exist so
                      : the SNMP agent attempts to create the row.
              Step 4. : The row creation is successful.
              Step 5. : The value of the attribute
                      : adsl2LineCmndConfLdsfFailReasonreason is set
                      : to success(2).
          12. Another example of use of this table is as follows:
              Step 1. : The manager creates a row in adsl2SCStatusTable
                      : for a particular ADSL2 line.
              Step 2. : The DELT is started on the above-mentioned

        The QLN(f) is represented as ( -23-n(i)/2), with n(i) in the
        range 0 to 254.  A special value n(i)=255 indicates that no

          When a row in the adsl2LineConfProfTable table
          (the parent row) is created, the SNMP agent will
          automatically create a 'mandatory' row in this table.
          When the parent row is deleted, the SNMP agent will
          automatically delete all associated rows in this table.
          Any attempt to delete the 'mandatory' row using the
          adsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus attribute will be
          rejected by the SNMP agent.
          The manager MAY create an 'optional' row in this table
          using the adsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus attribute if
          the parent row exists.
          The manager MAY delete an 'optional' row in this table
          using the adsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus attribute at

          If the actual transmission mode of a DSL line does not

          the line will use the PSD configuration from the

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


4.  Implementation Analysis

   A management application intended to manage ADSL links (e.g.,
   G.992.1) with this MIB module must be modified to adapt itself to
   certain differences between RFC 2662 [RFC2662] and this MIB module,
   including the following aspects:

   o  Although the configuration templates/profiles allow referring to
      1-4 bearer channels, ADSL links are limited to 2 channels at most.

   o  Although the channel configuration profile allows higher data
      rates, ADSL links are limited to downstream/upstream data rates as
      assumed in RFC 2662 [RFC2662].

   o  The Impulse Noise Protection (INP) configuration parameters are
      given by minimum protection and maximum delay parameters.

   o  The line configuration profile includes a sub-table that addresses
      mode-specific parameters.  For ADSL links, the management
      application SHOULD create a row in that table for the 'adsl' mode.

   o  The line configuration profile includes parameters that are
      irrelevant for ADSL links.  Similarly, many status parameters in
      the MIB are irrelevant for certain ADSL modes.  Therefore, it is
      advised to consult with ITU G.997.1 standard [G.997.1] regarding
      the scope and relevance of each parameter in this MIB.

5.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  adsl2LineTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LineCnfgTemplate
      *  adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate
      *  adsl2LineCmndConfPmsf
      *  adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf
      *  adsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart




Morgenstern, et al.         Standards Track                   [Page 155]

RFC 4706                     ADSL2-LINE MIB                November 2006


      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCnfgTemplate could have a major
      adverse operational effect on many lines simultaneously.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineAlarmCnfgTemplate could have a
      contrary effect on notifications.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndConfPmsf could have an
      adverse affect on the power consumption of a line and may disrupt
      an operational service.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndConfLdsf could cause an
      unscheduled line test to be carried out on the line.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LineCmndAutomodeColdStart could cause
      an unscheduled cold reset to the line.

   o  adsl2SCStatusTable

      This table contains one object, adsl2SCStatusRowStatus, that
      supports SET operations.  Unauthorized changes could result in
      line test results being deleted prematurely.

   o  adsl2LineConfTemplateTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LConfTempLineProfile
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile

      *  adsl2LConfTempChan3RaRatioUs
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioDs
      *  adsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioUs
      *  adsl2LConfTempRowStatus

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempLineProfile,
      adsl2LConfTempChan1ConfProfile, adsl2LConfTempChan2ConfProfile,
      adsl2LConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or adsl2LConfTempChan4ConfProfile
      could have an adverse operational effect on several lines; could

      change several lines over to running in unwanted levels of
      operation; or could result in several services undergoing changes
      in the number of channels that carry the service.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempChan1RaRatioDs,
      adsl2LConfTempChan2RaRatioDs, adsl2LConfTempChan3RaRatioDs, or
      adsl2LConfTempChan4RaRatioDs, would alter the relative rate
      allocations among all channels belonging to a line.  This could
      have an adverse operational effect on several lines.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfTempRowStatus could result in
      templates being created or brought into service prematurely; or
      could result in templates being inadvertently deleted or taken out
      of service.

   o  adsl2LineConfProfTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LConfProfScMaskDs
      *  adsl2LConfProfScMaskUs

      Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above
      objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational
      effect on several lines.

      Also, unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfProfRowStatus could result
      in unwanted line profiles being created or brought into service
      prematurely; or could result in line profiles being inadvertently
      deleted or taken out of service.

   o  adsl2LineConfProfModeSpecTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LConfProfMaxNomPsdDs
      *  adsl2LConfProfMaxNomPsdUs
      *  adsl2LConfProfMaxNomAtpDs
      *  adsl2LConfProfMaxNomAtpUs

      *  adsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus

      Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above
      objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational
      effect on several lines.

      Also, unauthorized changes to adsl2LConfProfModeSpecRowStatus
      could result in unwanted PSD configurations being created or
      brought into service prematurely; or could result in PSD
      configurations being inadvertently deleted or taken out of
      service.

   o  adsl2ChConfProfileTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2ChConfProfImaEnabled
      *  adsl2ChConfProfRowStatus

      Unauthorized changes resulting in the setting of any of the above
      objects to an incorrect value could have an adverse operational
      effect on several lines.

      Also, unauthorized changes to adsl2ChConfProfRowStatus could
      result in unwanted channel profiles being created or brought into
      service prematurely; or could result in channel profiles being
      inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

   o  adsl2LineAlarmConfTemplateTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LAlarmConfTempLineProfile
      *  adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan1ConfProfile
      *  adsl2LalarmConfTempChan2ConfProfile
      *  adsl2LalarmConfTempChan3ConfProfile
      *  adsl2LalarmConfTempChan4ConfProfile
      *  adsl2LAlarmConfTempRowStatus

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LAlarmConfTempLineProfile,
      adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan1ConfProfile,
      adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan2ConfProfile,
      adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan3ConfProfile, or
      adsl2LAlarmConfTempChan4ConfProfile could have an adverse effect
      on the management of notifications generated at the scope of
      several to many lines; or could change several to many lines over
      to running with unwanted management rates for generated
      notifications.

      Unauthorized changes to adsl2LAlarmConfTempRowStatus could result
      in alarm templates being created or brought into service
      prematurely; or could result in alarm templates being
      inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

   o  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileTable

      The table consists of the following objects that support SET
      operations:

      *  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileAtucThresh15MinFecs
      *  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileAtucThresh15MinEs
      *  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileAtucThresh15MinSes

      *  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileThresh15MinFailedFullInt
      *  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileThresh15MinFailedShrtInt
      *  adsl2LineAlarmConfProfileRowStatus

         Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a
         notification being suppressed or deferred.  Setting a threshold
         to 0 could result in a notification being suppressed.
         Suppressing or deferring a notification could prevent the
         timely delivery of important diagnostic information.
         Decreasing any of the threshold values could result in a
         notification being sent from the network falsely reporting a
         threshold crossing.

         Changing a threshold value could also have an impact on the
         amount of notifications the agent sends.  The Notifications
         Section of this document has a paragraph that provides general
         guidance on the rate-limiting of notifications.  Agent
         implementations not providing rate-limiting could result in
         notifications being generated at an uncontrolled rate.
         Unauthorized changes to a threshold value could result in an
         undesired notification rate.

         Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted
         line alarm profiles being created or brought into service.
         Also, changes to the row status could result in line alarm
         profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

         Increasing any of the threshold values could result in a
         notification being suppressed or deferred.  Setting a threshold
         to 0 could result in a notification being suppressed.
         Suppressing or deferring a notification could prevent the

         Unauthorized changes to row status could result in unwanted
         channel alarm profiles being created or brought into service.
         Also, changes to the row status could result in channel alarm
         profiles being inadvertently deleted or taken out of service.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  adsl2LineInventoryTable

      Access to these objects would allow an intruder to obtain
      information about which vendor's equipment is in use on the
      network.  Further, such information is considered sensitive in
      many environments for competitive reasons.

      *  adsl2LInvG994VendorId
      *  adsl2LInvSystemVendorId
      *  adsl2LInvVersionNumber
      *  adsl2LInvSerialNumber
      *  adsl2LInvSelfTestResult
      *  adsl2LInvTransmissionCapabilities

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], Section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   It is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to enable cryptographic
   security.  It is then a customer/operator responsibility to ensure
   that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB module
   is properly configured to give access only to those objects whose
   principals (users) have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
