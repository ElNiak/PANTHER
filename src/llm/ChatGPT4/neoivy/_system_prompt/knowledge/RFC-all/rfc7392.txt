      Explicit Path Routing for Dynamic Multi-Segment Pseudowires

Abstract

   When set up through an explicit path, dynamic Multi-Segment
   Pseudowires (MS-PWs) may be required to provide a simple solution for
   1:1 protection with diverse primary and backup MS-PWs for a service,
   or to enable controlled signaling (strict or loose) for special MS-
   PWs.  This document specifies the extensions and procedures required
   to enable dynamic MS-PWs to be established along explicit paths.

1.  Introduction

   Procedures for dynamically establishing Multi-Segment Pseudowires
   (MS-PWs), where their paths are automatically determined using a
   dynamic routing protocol, are defined in [RFC7267].  For 1:1
   protection of MS-PWs with primary and backup paths, MS-PWs need to be
   established through a diverse set of Switching Provider Edges (S-PEs)
   to avoid any single points of failure at the PW level.  [RFC7267]
   allows this through BGP-based mechanisms.  This document defines an
   additional mechanism that allows Source Terminating Provider Edges
   (ST-PEs) to explicitly choose the path that a PW would take through
   the intervening S-PEs.  Explicit path routing of dynamic MS-PWs may
   also be required for controlled setup of dynamic MS-PWs and network
   resource management.

   Note that in many deployments the ST-PE will not have a view of the
   topology of S-PEs and so the explicit route will need to be supplied
   from a management application.  How that management application
   determines the explicit route is outside the scope of this document.

2.  Requirements Language and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC7267], [RFC4447],
   and [RFC5036].

   The following additional terminology is used:

   Abstract Node:  A group of nodes (S-PEs) representing an explicit hop
      along the path of an MS-PW.  An abstract node is identified by an
      IPv4, IPv6, or S-PE address.

3.  Explicit Path in MS-PW Signaling

   This section describes the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
   extensions required for signaling explicit paths in dynamic MS-PW
   setup messages.  An explicitly routed MS-PW is set up using a Label
   Mapping message that carries an ordered list of the S-PEs that the
   MS-PW is expected to traverse.  The ordered list is encoded as a
   series of Explicit Route Hop TLVs (ER-Hop TLVs) encoded in an ER-TLV
   that is carried in a Label Mapping message.

3.1.  S-PE Addressing

   An S-PE address is used to identify a given S-PE among the set of
   S-PEs belonging to the Packet Switched Networks (PSNs) that may be
   used by an MS-PW.  Each S-PE MUST be assigned an address as specified
   in Section 3.2 of [RFC7267].  An S-PE that is capable of dynamic
   MS-PW signaling, but has not been assigned an S-PE address, and that
   receives a Label Mapping message for a dynamic MS-PW MUST follow the
   procedures in Section 3.2 of [RFC7267].

3.2.  Explicit Route TLV (ER-TLV)

   The ER-TLV specifies the path to be taken by the MS-PW being
   established.  Each hop along the path is represented by an abstract
   node, which is a group of one or more S-PEs, identified by an IPv4,
   IPv6, or S-PE address.  The ER-TLV format is as per Section 4.1 of
   [RFC3212].

   The ER-TLV contains one or more ER-Hop TLVs as defined in
   Section 3.3.

RFC 7392                 MS-PW Explicit Routing            December 2014


3.3.  Explicit Route Hop TLV (ER-Hop TLV)

   The contents of an ER-TLV are a series of variable-length ER-Hop
   TLVs.  Each hop contains the identification of an "abstract node"
   that represents the hop to be traversed.  The ER-Hop TLV format is as
   specified in Section 4.2 of [RFC3212].

   [RFC3212] defines four ER-Hop TLV Types: IPv4 Prefix, IPv6 Prefix,
   Autonomous System Number, and LSP-ID.  This document specifies the
   following new ER-Hop TLV Type:

                 Value  Type
                 ------ --------------------------------
                 0x0805 L2 PW Address of Switching Point

                                ER-Hop TLV

   Details of the ER-Hop semantics are defined in Section 3.4.

3.4.  ER-Hop Semantics

   This section describes the various semantics associated with the
   ER-Hop TLV.

3.4.1.  ER-Hop Type: IPv4 Prefix

   The semantics of the IPv4 ER-Hop TLV Type are specified in [RFC3212],
   Section 4.7.1.

3.4.2.  ER-Hop Type: IPv6 Prefix

   The semantics of the IPv6 ER-Hop TLV Type are specified in [RFC3212],
   Section 4.7.2.

3.4.3.  ER-Hop Type: L2 PW Address

   The semantics of the L2 PW Address ER-Hop TLV Type, which contains
   the L2 PW Address derived from the Generalized PWid Forwarding
   Equivalence Class (FEC) AII Type 2 structure as defined in [RFC5003],
   are as follows.

      All other fields (AII Type, Length, Global ID, Prefix, and AC ID)
      define the L2 PW Address and are to be set and interpreted as
      defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC5003].

4.  Explicit Route TLV Processing

4.1.  Next-Hop Selection

   A PW Label Mapping message containing an Explicit Route TLV specifies
   the next hop for a given MS-PW path.  Selection of this next hop by
   the ST-PE or S-PE inserting the ER-Hop TLV may involve a selection
   from a set of possible alternatives.  The mechanism for making a
   selection from this set is implementation specific and is outside the
   scope of this document.  The mechanism used to select a particular
   path is also outside the scope of this document, but each node MUST
   determine a loop-free path if it is to signal the MS-PW.  [RFC6073],
   Section 7.6 provides a mechanism by which a node can check that the
   path taken by an MS-PW does not include loops.

   As noted in Section 1, in many deployments the ST-PE will not have a
   view of the topology of S-PEs and so the path will need to be
   supplied from a management application.

   If a loop-free path cannot be found by an ST-PE or S-PE, then a node
   MUST NOT attempt to signal the MS-PW.  For an S-PE, if it cannot
   determine a loop-free path, then the received Label Mapping message
   MUST be released with a status code of "PW Loop Detected" as per
   Section 4.2.3 of [RFC7267].

   To determine the next hop for the MS-PW path, a node performs the
   following steps.  Note that these procedures assume that a valid S-PE
   address has been assigned to the node, as per Section 3.1, above.

   1.  The node receiving the Label Mapping message that contains an
       ER-TLV MUST evaluate the first ER-Hop.  If the L bit is not set
       in the first ER-Hop and if the node is not part of the abstract
       node described by the first ER-Hop (i.e., it does not lie within
       the prefix as determined by the prefix length specified in the
       ER-Hop TLV), it has received the message in error.  Therefore,
       the node MUST reply with a Label Release message with a "Bad
       Initial ER-Hop Error" (0x04000004) status code.  If the L bit is
       set and the local node is not part of the abstract node described
       by the first ER-Hop, the node selects a next hop that is along
       the path to the abstract node described by the first ER-Hop.  If
       there is no ER-Hop TLV contained in the ER-TLV, the message is
       also in error, and the node SHOULD return a "Bad Explicit Routing
       TLV Error" (0x04000001) status code in a Label Release message
       sent to the upstream node.  Note that this statement does not



Dutta, et al.                Standards Track                    [Page 6]

RFC 7392                 MS-PW Explicit Routing            December 2014


       preclude a Label Mapping message with no ER-TLV.  If a Label
       Mapping message with no ER-TLV is received, then it MUST be
       processed as per [RFC7267].

   2.  If there are no further ER-Hop TLVs following the first ER-Hop
       TLV, this indicates the end of the explicit route.  The Explicit
       Route TLV MUST be removed from the Label Mapping message.  This
       node may or may not be the end of the PW.  Processing continues
       as per Section 4.2, where a new Explicit Route TLV MAY be added
       to the Label Mapping message.

   3.  If a second ER-Hop TLV does exist, and the node is also a part of
       the abstract node described by the second ER-Hop, then the node
       deletes the first ER-Hop and continues processing with step 2,
       above.  Note that this makes the second ER-Hop into the first
       ER-Hop for the iteration for the next PW segment.

   4.  The node determines if it is topologically adjacent to the
       abstract node described by the second ER-Hop.  That is, it is
       directly connected to the next node by a PW control-plane
       adjacency.  If so, the node selects a particular next hop that is
       a member of the abstract node.  The node then deletes the first
       ER-Hop and continues processing as per Section 4.2, below.

   5.  Next, the node selects a next hop within the abstract node of the
       first ER-Hop that is along the path to the abstract node of the
       second ER-Hop.  If no such path exists, then there are two cases:

       A.  If the second ER-Hop is a strict ER Hop, then there is an
           error, and the node MUST return a Label Release message to
           the upstream node with a "Bad Strict Node Error" (0x04000002)
           status code.

       B.  Otherwise, if the second ER-Hop is a loose ER Hop, then the
           node selects any next hop that is along the path to the next
           abstract node.  If no path exists within the MPLS domain,
           then there is an error, and the node MUST return a Label
           Release message to the upstream node with a "Bad Loose Node
           Error" (0x04000003) status code.

   6.  Finally, the node replaces the first ER-Hop with any ER Hop that
       denotes an abstract node containing the next hop.  This is
       necessary so that when the explicit route is received by the next
       hop, it will be accepted.

   7.  Progress the Label Mapping message to the next hop.

RFC 7392                 MS-PW Explicit Routing            December 2014


4.2.  Adding ER Hops to the Explicit Route TLV

   After selecting a next hop, the node MAY alter the explicit route in
   the following ways.

   If, as part of executing the algorithm in Section 4.1, the Explicit
   Route TLV is removed, then the node MAY add a new Explicit Route TLV.

   Otherwise, if the node is a member of the abstract node for the first
   ER-Hop, then a series of ER Hops MAY be inserted before the First ER
   Hop or the first ER-Hop MAY be replaced.  Each ER Hop in this series
   MUST denote an abstract node that is a subset of the current abstract
   node.

   Alternately, if the first ER-Hop is a loose ER Hop, an arbitrary
   series of ER Hops MAY be inserted prior to the first ER-Hop.

5.  IANA Considerations

   RFC 5036 [RFC5036] defines the LDP TLV name space, which is
   maintained by IANA, in the LDP "TLV Type Name Space" registry.  TLV
   types for the Explicit Route TLV, the IPv4 Prefix ER-Hop TLV, and the
   IPv6 Prefix ER-Hop TLV are already defined in this registry.

   IANA has assigned a further code point from the IETF consensus
   portion of this registry as follows:

      TLV Type                               Value   Reference
      ------------------------------------   ------  -------------
      L2 PW Address of Switching Point       0x0805  This Document

6.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC5036], [RFC4447], and [RFC7267].  The security
   considerations detailed in those documents apply to the protocol
   extensions described in this RFC.

   As with [RFC7267], it should be noted that the path selection
   mechanisms specified in this document enable the network to
   automatically select the S-PEs that are used to forward packets on
   the MS-PW.  Appropriate tools, such as the Virtual Circuit
   Connectivity Verification (VCCV) trace mechanisms specified in
   [RFC6073], can be used by an operator of the network to verify the
   path taken by the MS-PW and therefore be satisfied that the path does
   not represent an additional security risk.
