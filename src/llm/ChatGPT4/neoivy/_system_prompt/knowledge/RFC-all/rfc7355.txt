              Indicating WebSocket Protocol as a Transport
    in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Common Log Format (CLF)

Abstract

   RFC 7118 specifies a WebSocket subprotocol as a reliable real-time
   transport mechanism between Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
   entities to enable usage of SIP in web-oriented deployments.  This
   document updates the SIP Common Log Format (CLF), defined in RFC
   6873, with a new "Transport Flag" for such SIP WebSocket transport.

RFC 7355             WebSocket Transport in SIP CLF       September 2014


1.  Introduction

   The WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] enables bidirectional message
   exchange between clients and servers on top of a persistent TCP
   connection (optionally secured with TLS [RFC5246]).  The initial
   protocol handshake makes use of HTTP [RFC7230] semantics, allowing
   the WebSocket protocol to reuse existing transport connections.

   RFC 7118 [RFC7118] defines a WebSocket subprotocol for transporting
   SIP messages between a WebSocket client and server.

   SIP messages can be logged using the Common Log Format defined in RFC
   6873 [RFC6873].  In order to make such SIP CLF logging possible for
   SIP messages transported over the WebSocket protocol, a new WebSocket
   "Transport Flag" ('W') must be added to the "Transport Flags" already
   defined in RFC 6873 [RFC6873] (i.e., UDP, TCP, and SCTP).

   This document updates RFC 6873 [RFC6873] by defining a new SIP CLF
   "Transport Flag" value for WebSocket.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Document Conventions

   This document contains several examples of SIP CLF records showing
   messages over plain and secure WebSocket connections.  The formatting
   described in this document does not permit the examples to be
   unambiguously rendered due to the constraints imposed by the
   formatting rules for RFCs.  To avoid ambiguity and to meet the RFC
   layout requirements, this document uses the <allOneLine/> markup
   convention established in [RFC4475].  This markup convention is
   described in detail in Section 3 of RFC 6873 [RFC6873] and used
   throughout that document for representing the syntax of SIP CLF
   records.

4.  Usage of the WebSocket Transport Flag

   Section 4.2 of RFC6873 [RFC6873] specifies the mandatory fields in a
   SIP CLF record.  The fourth and fifth bytes of the five-byte "Flags
   Field" are the "Transport Flag" and the "Encryption Flag",
   respectively.  SIP messages transported over both a plain and secure
   WebSocket connection can be clearly distinguished by appropriately
   setting these two flag fields.

RFC 7355             WebSocket Transport in SIP CLF       September 2014


   The currently registered values of the "Transport Flag" (Section 9.2
   of RFC 6873) are UDP ('U'), TCP ('T'), and SCTP ('S').  This document
   defines and registers a new "Transport Flag" value 'W' for WebSocket
   transport of SIP messages and consequently updates RFC 6873 [RFC6873]
   and the IANA "SIP CLF Transport Flag Values" registry.

   SIP CLF records of messages transported over a plain WebSocket
   connection (WS) MUST set the "Transport Flag" to this new 'W' value
   and the "Encryption Flag" value to 'U' (Unencrypted).  SIP CLF
   records of messages transported over a secure WebSocket (WSS)
   connection (i.e., WS over TLS) MUST set the "Transport Flag" to this
   new 'W' value and the "Encryption Flag" value to 'E' (Encrypted).

5.  Examples

   The following examples show sample SIP CLF records logged for SIP
   messages transported over both plain and secure WebSocket
   connections.

5.1.  SIP over WebSocket (WS)

   The following example represents a SIP INVITE request sent over a
   plain WebSocket connection.  For the sake of brevity, the Session
   Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] body is omitted.

   INVITE sip:bob@example.com SIP/2.0
   Via: SIP/2.0/WS df7jal23ls0d.invalid;branch=z9hG4bK56sdasks
   From: sip:alice@example.com;tag=asdyka899
   To: sip:bob@example.com
   Call-ID: asidkj3ss
   CSeq: 1 INVITE
   Max-Forwards: 70
   Date: Thu, 6 Feb 2014 15:02:03 GMT
   Supported: path, outbound, gruu
   Route: <sip:proxy.example.com:80;transport=ws;lr>
   Contact: <sip:alice@example.com;gr=urn:uuid:f81-7dec-14a06cf1;ob>
   Content-Type: application/sdp
   Content-Length: 418

   Shown below is approximately how this message would appear as a
   single record in a SIP CLF logging file if encoded according to the
   syntax described in [RFC6873].  Due to RFC conventions, this log
   entry has been split into five lines, instead of the two lines that
   actually appear in a log file; and the tab characters have been
   padded out using spaces to simulate their appearance in a text
   terminal.

   The original SIP CLF format can be obtained by reversing the effects
   of uuencode by simply applying the uudecode transform.  Additionally,
   to recover the unencoded file, the Base64 text above may be passed as
   input to the following perl script (the output should be redirected
   to a file).

   use MIME::Base64;

             if ( m/^\s*[^\s]+\s*$/)

               $bdata = $bdata . $_;
             }
          }
   }
   print decode_base64($bdata);

RFC 7355             WebSocket Transport in SIP CLF       September 2014


6.  Security Considerations

   This document merely adds a new "Transport Flag" value for the
   WebSocket protocol.  This value may be set in a SIP CLF record, but
   its use does not intrinsically introduce any new security
   considerations.  When logging protocol information, such as with SIP
   CLF, there are a myriad of security, privacy, and data protection
   issues to consider.  These are exhaustively described in RFC 6872
   [RFC6872] and RFC 6873 [RFC6873].

   Any security considerations specific to the WebSocket protocol or its
   application as a transport for SIP are detailed in the relevant
   specifications (the WebSocket protocol [RFC6455] and SIP over
   WebSockets [RFC7118]) and are considered outside the scope of this
   document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new value ('W') for SIP CLF "Transport Flag".
   IANA has registered this value in the "SIP CLF Transport Flag Values"
   registry, as shown in Table 1 below.

            +-------+--------------------+--------------------+
            | Value | Transport Protocol |     Reference      |
            +-------+--------------------+--------------------+
            |   W   |     WebSocket      | RFC 7118, RFC 7355 |
            +-------+--------------------+--------------------+
