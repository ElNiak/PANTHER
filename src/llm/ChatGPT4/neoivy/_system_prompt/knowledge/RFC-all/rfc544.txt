NIC # 17782                                                July 13, 1973


               Locating On-Line Documentation at SRI-ARC

Where there used to be one, there are now two files to help users locate
user documentation and other files available in NLS:

    <NIC>LOCATOR will lead the user to NIC functional documents by means
    of links.  Its branch labeled "ARC SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION" will direct
    the user to <USERGUIDES>ARCLOCATOR.

        (nic, locator, l:w)

    <USERGUIDES>ARCLOCATOR includes documentation of the SRI-ARC system.
    Many ARC features are available for Network use, and the documents
    in <USERGUIDES>ARCLOCATOR should serve to introduce users to these
    capabilities.

        (userguides, arclocator, l:w)

These files are formatted in a way that allows the documents to be
easily accessed by inexperienced NLS users.  Both files contain
instructions for their use as branch one.  To see these instructions:

    L[oad] F[ile] <nic>locator CR

    P[rint] B[ranch] .1 CA wn  CA

Please send ideas and suggestions for the LOCATOR files to KIRK or NDM
at SRI-ARC.
