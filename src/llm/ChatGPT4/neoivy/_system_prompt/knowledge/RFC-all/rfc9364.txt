                    DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)

Abstract

   This document describes the DNS Security Extensions (commonly called
   "DNSSEC") that are specified in RFCs 4033, 4034, and 4035, as well as
   a handful of others.  One purpose is to introduce all of the RFCs in
   one place so that the reader can understand the many aspects of
   DNSSEC.  This document does not update any of those RFCs.  A second
   purpose is to state that using DNSSEC for origin authentication of
   DNS data is the best current practice.  A third purpose is to provide
   a single reference for other documents that want to refer to DNSSEC.

1.  Introduction

   The core specification for what we know as DNSSEC (the combination of
   [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035]) describes a set of protocols
   that provide origin authentication of DNS data.  [RFC6840] updates
   and extends those core RFCs but does not fundamentally change the way
   that DNSSEC works.

   This document lists RFCs that should be considered by someone
   creating an implementation of, or someone deploying, DNSSEC as it is
   currently standardized.  Although an effort was made to be thorough,
   the reader should not assume this list is comprehensive.  It uses
   terminology from those documents without defining that terminology.
   It also points to the relevant IANA registry groups that relate to
   DNSSEC.  It does not, however, point to standards that rely on zones
   needing to be signed by DNSSEC, such as DNS-Based Authentication of
   Named Entities (DANE) [RFC6698].

1.1.  DNSSEC as a Best Current Practice

   Using the DNSSEC set of protocols is the best current practice for
   adding origin authentication of DNS data.  To date, no Standards
   Track RFCs offer any other method for such origin authentication of
   data in the DNS.

   More than 15 years after the DNSSEC specification was published, it
   is still not widely deployed.  Recent estimates are that fewer than
   10% of the domain names used for websites are signed, and only around
   a third of queries to recursive resolvers are validated.  However,
   this low level of deployment does not affect whether using DNSSEC is
   a best current practice; it just indicates that the value of
   deploying DNSSEC is often considered lower than the cost.
   Nonetheless, the significant deployment of DNSSEC beneath some top-
   level domains (TLDs) and the near-universal deployment of DNSSEC for
   the TLDs in the DNS root zone demonstrate that DNSSEC is applicable
   for implementation by both ordinary and highly sophisticated domain
   owners.

1.2.  Implementing DNSSEC

   Developers of validating resolvers and authoritative servers, as well
   as operators of validating resolvers and authoritative servers, need
   to know the parts of the DNSSEC protocol that would affect them.
   They should read the DNSSEC core documents and probably at least be
   familiar with the extensions.  Developers will probably need to be
   very familiar with the algorithm documents as well.

   As a side note, some of the DNSSEC-related RFCs have significant
   errata, so reading the RFCs should also include looking for the
   related errata.

2.  DNSSEC Core Documents

   What we refer to as "DNSSEC" is the third iteration of the DNSSEC
   specification; [RFC2065] was the first, and [RFC2535] was the second.
   Earlier iterations have not been deployed on a significant scale.
   Throughout this document, "DNSSEC" means the protocol initially
   defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035].

   The three initial core documents generally cover different topics:

   *  [RFC4033] is an overview of DNSSEC, including how it might change
      the resolution of DNS queries.

   *  [RFC4034] specifies the DNS resource records used in DNSSEC.  It
      obsoletes many RFCs about earlier versions of DNSSEC.

   *  [RFC4035] covers the modifications to the DNS protocol incurred by
      DNSSEC.  These include signing zones, serving signed zones,
      resolving in light of DNSSEC, and authenticating DNSSEC-signed
      data.

   At the time this set of core documents was published, someone could
   create a DNSSEC implementation of signing software, of a DNSSEC-aware
   authoritative server, and/or of a DNSSEC-aware recursive resolver
   from the three core documents, plus a few older RFCs specifying the
   cryptography used.  Those two older documents are the following:

   *  [RFC2536] defines how to use the DSA signature algorithm (although
      it refers to other documents for the details).  DSA was thinly
      implemented and can safely be ignored by DNSSEC implementations.

   *  [RFC3110] defines how to use the RSA signature algorithm (although
      refers to other documents for the details).  RSA is still among
      the most popular signing algorithms for DNSSEC.

   It is important to note that later RFCs update the core documents.
   As just one example, [RFC9077] changes how TTL values are calculated
   in DNSSEC processing.

2.1.  Addition to the DNSSEC Core

   As with any major protocol, developers and operators discovered
   issues with the original core documents over the years.  [RFC6840] is
   an omnibus update to the original core documents and thus itself has
   become a core document.  In addition to covering new requirements
   from new DNSSEC RFCs, it describes many important security and
   interoperability issues that arose during the deployment of the
   initial specifications, particularly after the DNS root was signed in
   2010.  It also lists some errors in the examples of the core
   specifications.

   [RFC6840] brings a few additions into the core of DNSSEC.  It makes
   NSEC3 [RFC5155] as much a part of DNSSEC as NSEC is.  It also makes
   the SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash functions defined in [RFC4509] and
   [RFC5702] part of the core.

3.  Additional Cryptographic Algorithms and DNSSEC

   Current cryptographic algorithms typically weaken over time as
   computing power improves and new cryptoanalysis emerges.  Two new
   signing algorithms have been adopted by the DNSSEC community:
   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) [RFC6605] and
   Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) [RFC8080].  ECDSA
   and EdDSA have become very popular signing algorithms in recent
   years.  The GOST signing algorithm [GOST-SIGN] was also adopted but
   has seen very limited use, likely because it is a national algorithm
   specific to a very small number of countries.

   Implementation developers who want to know which algorithms to
   implement in DNSSEC software should refer to [RFC8624].  Note that
   this specification is only about what algorithms should and should
   not be included in implementations, i.e., it is not advice about
   which algorithms zone operators should or should not use for signing,
   nor which algorithms recursive resolver operators should or should
   not use for validation.

4.  Extensions to DNSSEC

   The DNSSEC community has extended the DNSSEC core and the
   cryptographic algorithms, both in terms of describing good
   operational practices and in new protocols.  Some of the RFCs that
   describe these extensions include the following:

   *  [RFC5011] describes a method to help resolvers update their DNSSEC
      trust anchors in an automated fashion.  This method was used in
      2018 to update the DNS root trust anchor.

   *  [RFC6781] is a compendium of operational practices that may not be
      obvious from reading just the core specifications.

   *  [RFC7344] describes using the CDS and CDNSKEY resource records to
      help automate the maintenance of DS records in the parents of
      signed zones.

   *  [RFC8078] extends [RFC7344] by showing how to do initial setup of
      trusted relationships between signed parent and child zones.

   *  [RFC8198] describes how a validating resolver can emit fewer
      queries in signed zones that use NSEC and NSEC3 for negative
      caching.

   *  [RFC9077] updates [RFC8198] with respect to the TTL fields in
      signed records.

5.  Additional Documents of Interest

   The documents listed above constitute the core of DNSSEC, the
   additional cryptographic algorithms, and the major extensions to
   DNSSEC.  This section lists some additional documents that someone
   interested in implementing or operating DNSSEC might find of value:

   *  [RFC4470] "describes how to construct DNSSEC NSEC resource records
      that cover a smaller range of names than called for by [RFC4034].
      By generating and signing these records on demand, authoritative
      name servers can effectively stop the disclosure of zone contents
      otherwise made possible by walking the chain of NSEC records in a
      signed zone".

   *  [RFC6975] "specifies a way for validating end-system resolvers to
      signal to a server which digital signature and hash algorithms
      they support".

   *  [RFC7129] "provides additional background commentary and some
      context for the NSEC and NSEC3 mechanisms used by DNSSEC to
      provide authenticated denial-of-existence responses".  This
      background is particularly important for understanding NSEC and
      NSEC3 usage.

   *  [RFC7583] "describes the issues surrounding the timing of events
      in the rolling of a key in a DNSSEC-secured zone".

   *  [RFC7646] "defines Negative Trust Anchors (NTAs), which can be
      used to mitigate DNSSEC validation failures by disabling DNSSEC
      validation at specified domains".

   *  [RFC7958] "describes the format and publication mechanisms IANA
      has used to distribute the DNSSEC trust anchors".

   *  [RFC8027] "describes problems that a Validating DNS resolver,
      stub-resolver, or application might run into within a non-
      compliant infrastructure".

   *  [RFC8145] "specifies two different ways for validating resolvers
      to signal to a server which keys are referenced in their chain of
      trust".

   *  [RFC8499] contains lists of terminology used when talking about
      DNS; Sections 10 and 11 cover DNSSEC.

   *  [RFC8509] "specifies a mechanism that will allow an end user and
      third parties to determine the trusted key state for the root key
      of the resolvers that handle that user's DNS queries".

   *  [RFC8901] "presents deployment models that accommodate this
      scenario [when each DNS provider independently signs zone data
      with their own keys] and describes these key-management
      requirements".

   *  [RFC9276] "provides guidance on setting NSEC3 parameters based on
      recent operational deployment experience".

   There will certainly be other RFCs related to DNSSEC that are
   published after this one.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA already has three registry groups that relate to DNSSEC:

   *  DNSSEC algorithm numbers (https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-
      sec-alg-numbers)

   *  DNSSEC NSEC3 parameters (https://www.iana.org/assignments/dnssec-
      nsec3-parameters)

   *  DNSSEC DS RRtype digest algorithms
      (https://www.iana.org/assignments/ds-rr-types)

   The rules for the DNSSEC algorithm registry were set in the core RFCs
   and updated by [RFC6014], [RFC6725], and [RFC9157].

   This document does not update or create any registry groups or
   registries.

7.  Security Considerations

   All of the security considerations from all of the RFCs referenced in
   this document apply here.
