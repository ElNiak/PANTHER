         Deprecation of TLS 1.1 for Email Submission and Access

Abstract

   This specification updates the current recommendation for the use of
   the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol to provide
   confidentiality of email between a Mail User Agent (MUA) and a Mail
   Submission Server or Mail Access Server.  This document updates RFC
   8314.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC8314] defines the minimum recommended version of TLS as version
   1.1.  Due to the deprecation of TLS 1.1 in [RFC8996], this
   recommendation is no longer valid.  Therefore, this document updates
   [RFC8314] so that the minimum version for TLS is TLS 1.2.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updates to RFC 8314

   OLD:

   |  4.1.  Deprecation of Services Using Cleartext and TLS Versions
   |  Less Than 1.1

   NEW:

   |  4.1.  Deprecation of Services Using Cleartext and TLS Versions
   |  Less Than 1.2

   OLD:

   |  As soon as practicable, MSPs currently supporting Secure Sockets
   |  Layer (SSL) 2.x, SSL 3.0, or TLS 1.0 SHOULD transition their users
   |  to TLS 1.1 or later and discontinue support for those earlier
   |  versions of SSL and TLS.

   NEW:

   |  As soon as practicable, MSPs currently supporting Secure Sockets
   |  Layer (SSL) 2.x, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1 SHOULD transition
   |  their users to TLS 1.2 or later and discontinue support for those
   |  earlier versions of SSL and TLS.

   In Section 4.1 of [RFC8314], the text should be revised from:

   OLD:

   |  One way is for the server to refuse a ClientHello message from any
   |  client sending a ClientHello.version field corresponding to any
   |  version of SSL or TLS 1.0.

   NEW:

   |  One way is for the server to refuse a ClientHello message from any
   |  client sending a ClientHello.version field corresponding to any
   |  version of SSL or TLS earlier than TLS 1.2.

   OLD:

   |  It is RECOMMENDED that new users be required to use TLS version
   |  1.1 or greater from the start.  However, an MSP may find it
   |  necessary to make exceptions to accommodate some legacy systems
   |  that support only earlier versions of TLS or only cleartext.

   NEW:

   |  It is RECOMMENDED that new users be required to use TLS version
   |  1.2 or greater from the start.  However, an MSP may find it
   |  necessary to make exceptions to accommodate some legacy systems
   |  that support only earlier versions of TLS or only cleartext.

   OLD:

   |  If, however, an MUA provides such an indication, it MUST NOT
   |  indicate confidentiality for any connection that does not at least
   |  use TLS 1.1 with certificate verification and also meet the
   |  minimum confidentiality requirements associated with that account.

   NEW:

   |  If, however, an MUA provides such an indication, it MUST NOT
   |  indicate confidentiality for any connection that does not at least
   |  use TLS 1.2 with certificate verification and also meet the
   |  minimum confidentiality requirements associated with that account.

   OLD

   |  MUAs MUST implement TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] or later.  Earlier TLS and
   |  SSL versions MAY also be supported, so long as the MUA requires at
   |  least TLS 1.1 [RFC4346] when accessing accounts that are
   |  configured to impose minimum confidentiality requirements.

   NEW:

   |  MUAs MUST implement TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] or later, e.g., TLS 1.3
   |  [RFC8446].  Earlier TLS and SSL versions MAY also be supported, so
   |  long as the MUA requires at least TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] when accessing
   |  accounts that are configured to impose minimum confidentiality
   |  requirements.

   OLD:

   |  The default minimum expected level of confidentiality for all new
   |  accounts MUST require successful validation of the server's
   |  certificate and SHOULD require negotiation of TLS version 1.1 or
   |  greater.  (Future revisions to this specification may raise these
   |  requirements or impose additional requirements to address newly
   |  discovered weaknesses in protocols or cryptographic algorithms.)

   NEW:

   |  The default minimum expected level of confidentiality for all new
   |  accounts MUST require successful validation of the server's
   |  certificate and SHOULD require negotiation of TLS version 1.2 or
   |  greater.  (Future revisions to this specification may raise these
   |  requirements or impose additional requirements to address newly
   |  discovered weaknesses in protocols or cryptographic algorithms.)

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

5.  Security Considerations

   The purpose of this document is to document updated recommendations
   for using TLS with email services.  Those recommendations are based
   on [RFC8996].
