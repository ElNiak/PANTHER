RFC 7759           Extensions for MPLS-TP OAM Config.      February 2016


1.  Introduction

   The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) describes a profile of MPLS that
   enables operational models typical in transport networks while
   providing additional Operations, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM), survivability, and other maintenance functions not currently
   supported by MPLS.  [RFC5860] defines the requirements for the OAM
   functionality of MPLS-TP.

   This document describes the configuration of proactive MPLS-TP OAM
   functions for a given Label Switched Path (LSP) using TLVs carried in
   LSP Ping [RFC4379].  In particular, it specifies the mechanisms
   necessary to establish MPLS-TP OAM entities at the maintenance points
   for monitoring and performing measurements on an LSP, as well as
   defining information elements and procedures to configure proactive
   MPLS-TP OAM functions running between Label Edge Routers (LERs).
   Initialization and control of on-demand MPLS-TP OAM functions are
   expected to be carried out by directly accessing network nodes via a
   management interface; hence, configuration and control of on-demand
   OAM functions are out of scope for this document.

   The Transport Profile of MPLS must, by definition [RFC5654], be
   capable of operating without a control plane.  Therefore, there are a
   few options for configuring MPLS-TP OAM: without a control plane
   using a Network Management System (NMS), implementing LSP Ping
   instead or with a control plane implementing extensions to signaling
   protocols RSVP Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) [RFC3209] and/or
   Targeted LDP [RFC5036].

   Proactive MPLS-TP OAM is performed by a set of protocols:
   Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC6428] for Continuity
   Check/Connectivity Verification, the Delay Measurement (DM) protocol
   [RFC6374], [RFC6375] for delay and delay variation (jitter)
   measurements, and the Loss Measurement (LM) protocol [RFC6374],
   [RFC6375] for packet loss and throughput measurements.  Additionally,
   there are a number of Fault Management Signals that can be configured
   [RFC6427].

   BFD is a protocol that provides low-overhead, fast detection of
   failures in the path between two forwarding engines, including the
   interfaces, data link(s), and to the extent possible, the forwarding
   engines themselves.  BFD can be used to detect the continuity and
   mis-connection defects of MPLS-TP point-to-point and might also be
   extended to support point-to-multipoint LSPs.

   The delay and loss measurements protocols [RFC6374] and [RFC6375] use
   a simple query/response model for performing both unidirectional and
   bidirectional measurements that allow the originating node to measure

RFC 7759           Extensions for MPLS-TP OAM Config.      February 2016


   packet loss and delay in forward, or forward and reverse directions.
   By timestamping and/or writing current packet counters to the
   measurement packets (four times, Transmit and Receive in both
   directions), current delays and packet losses can be calculated.  By
   performing successive delay measurements, the delay and/or inter-
   packet delay variation (jitter) can be calculated.  Current
   throughput can be calculated from the packet loss measurements by
   dividing the number of packets sent/received with the time it took to
   perform the measurement, given by the timestamp in the LM header.
   Combined with a packet generator, the throughput measurement can be
   used to measure the maximum capacity of a particular LSP.  It should
   be noted that this document does not specify how to configure
   on-demand throughput estimates based on saturating the connection as
   defined in [RFC6371]; rather, it only specifies how to enable the
   estimation of the current throughput based on loss measurements.

1.1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Theory of Operations

2.1.  MPLS OAM Configuration Operation Overview

   The MPLS-TP OAM tool set is described in [RFC6669].

   LSP Ping, or alternatively RSVP-TE [RFC7487], can be used to easily
   enable the different OAM functions by setting the corresponding flags
   in the MPLS OAM Functions TLV (refer to Section 2.2).  For a more
   detailed configuration, one may include sub-TLVs for the different
   OAM functions in order to specify various parameters in detail.

   Typically, intermediate nodes simply forward OAM configuration TLVs
   to the end node without any processing or modification.  At least one
   exception to this is if the FMS sub-TLV (refer to Section 2.2.9 ) is
   present.  This sub-TLV MUST be examined even by intermediate nodes
   that support this extension.  The sub-TLV MAY be present if a flag is
   set in the MPLS OAM Functions TLV.

2.1.1.  Configuration of BFD Sessions

   For this specification, BFD MUST run in either one of the two modes:

   o  Asynchronous mode, where both sides are in active mode

   o  Unidirectional mode

   In the simplest scenario, LSP Ping [RFC5884], or alternatively RSVP-
   TE [RFC7487], is used only to bootstrap a BFD session for an LSP,
   without any timer negotiation.

   Timer negotiation can be performed either in subsequent BFD control
   messages (in this case the operation is similar to bootstrapping
   based on LSP Ping described in [RFC5884]), or directly in the LSP
   Ping configuration messages.

   When BFD Control packets are transported in the Associated Channel
   Header (ACH) encapsulation, they are not protected by any end-to-end
   checksum; only lower layers provide error detection/correction.  A
   single bit error, e.g., a flipped bit in the BFD State field, could
   cause the receiving end to wrongly conclude that the link is down and
   in turn trigger protection switching.  To prevent this from



Bellagamba, et al.           Standards Track                    [Page 5]

RFC 7759           Extensions for MPLS-TP OAM Config.      February 2016


   happening, the BFD Configuration sub-TLV (refer to Section 2.2.1) has
   an Integrity flag that, when set, enables BFD Authentication using
   Keyed SHA1 with an empty key (all 0s) [RFC5880].  This would make
   every BFD Control packet carry a SHA1 hash of itself that can be used
   to detect errors.

   If BFD Authentication using a pre-shared key/password is desired
   (i.e., authentication and not only error detection), the BFD
   Authentication sub-TLV (refer to Section 2.2.4) MUST be included in
   the BFD Configuration sub-TLV.  The BFD Authentication sub-TLV is
   used to specify which authentication method that should be used and
   which pre-shared key/password that should be used for this particular
   session.  How the key exchange is performed is out of scope of this
   document.

2.1.2.  Configuration of Performance Monitoring

   It is possible to configure Performance Monitoring functionalities
   such as Loss, Delay, Delay/Interpacket Delay variation (jitter), and
   throughput as described in [RFC6374].

   When configuring Performance Monitoring functionalities, it is
   possible to choose either the default configuration, by only setting
   the respective flags in the MPLS OAM functions TLV, or a customized
   configuration.  To customize the configuration, one would set the
   respective flags in the MPLS OAM functions TLV and include the
   respective Loss and/or Delay sub-TLVs.

   By setting the PM Loss flag in the MPLS OAM Functions TLV and
   including the PM Loss sub-TLV (refer to Section 2.2.7), one can
   configure the measurement interval and loss threshold values for
   triggering protection.

   Delay measurements are configured by setting the PM Delay flag in the
   MPLS OAM Functions TLV and by including the PM Delay sub-TLV (refer
   to Section 2.2.8), one can configure the measurement interval and the
   delay threshold values for triggering protection.

2.1.3.  Configuration of Fault Management Signals

   To configure Fault Management Signals (FMSs) and their refresh time,
   the FMS Flag in the MPLS OAM Functions TLV MUST be set and the FMS
   sub-TLV MUST be included.  When configuring an FMS, an implementation
   can enable the default configuration by setting the FMS Flag in the
   OAM Function Flags sub-TLV.  In order to modify the default
   configuration, the MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV MUST be included.

   If an intermediate point is meant to originate FMS messages, this
   means that such an intermediate point is associated with a Server MEP
   through a co-located MPLS-TP client/server adaptation function, and
   the Fault Management subscription flag in the MPLS OAM FMS sub-TLV
   has been set as an indication of the request to create the
   association at each intermediate node of the client LSP.  The
   corresponding Server MEP needs to be configured by its own LSP Ping
   session or, alternatively, via a Network Management System (NMS) or
   RSVP-TE.

2.2.  MPLS OAM Functions TLV

   The MPLS OAM Functions TLV presented in Figure 1 is carried as a TLV
   of the MPLS Echo Request/Reply messages [RFC4379].

                  Figure 1: MPLS OAM Functions TLV Format

   The MPLS OAM Functions TLV contains the MPLS OAM Function Flags
   field.  The MPLS OAM Function Flags indicate which OAM functions
   should be activated as well as OAM function-specific sub-TLVs with
   configuration parameters for the particular function.

   Type: Indicates the MPLS OAM Functions TLV (Section 4).

   Length: The length of the MPLS OAM Function Flags field including the
   total length of the sub-TLVs in octets.

   MPLS OAM Function Flags: A bitmap numbered from left to right as
   shown in Figure 2.  These flags are managed by IANA (refer to
   Section 4.2).  Flags defined in this document are presented in
   Table 2.  Undefined flags MUST be set to zero and unknown flags MUST
   be ignored.  The flags indicate what OAM is being configured and
   direct the presence of optional sub-TLVs as set out below.

   Sub-TLVs corresponding to the different flags are as follows.  No
   meaning should be attached to the order of sub-TLVs.

   o  If a flag in the MPLS OAM Function Flags is set and the
      corresponding sub-TLVs listed below are absent, then this MPLS OAM
      function MUST be initialized according to its default settings.
      Default settings of MPLS OAM functions are outside the scope of
      this document.

   o  If any sub-TLV is present without the corresponding flag being
      set, the sub-TLV SHOULD be ignored.

   o  BFD Configuration sub-TLV, which MUST be included if either the
      CC, the CV, or both MPLS OAM Function flags are being set in the
      MPLS OAM Functions TLV.

   o  Performance Monitoring sub-TLV MUST be used to carry PM Loss sub-
      TLV and/or PM Delay sub-TLV.  If neither one of these sub-TLVs is
      present, then Performance Monitoring sub-TLV SHOULD NOT be
      included.  Empty, i.e., no enclosed sub-TLVs, Performance
      Monitoring sub-TLV SHOULD be ignored.

   o  PM Loss sub-TLV MAY be included if the PM/Loss OAM Function flag
      is set.  If the "PM Loss sub-TLV" is not included, default
      configuration values are used.  Such sub-TLV MAY also be included
      in case the Throughput function flag is set and there is the need
      to specify a measurement interval different from the default ones.
      In fact, the throughput measurement makes use of the same tool as
      the loss measurement; hence, the same TLV is used.

   o  PM Delay sub-TLV MAY be included if the PM/Delay OAM Function flag
      is set.  If the "PM Delay sub-TLV" is not included, default
      configuration values are used.

   o  FMS sub-TLV, that MAY be included if the FMS OAM Function flag is
      set.  If the "FMS sub-TLV" is not included, default configuration
      values are used.

   If all flags in the MPLS OAM Function Flags field have the same value
   of zero, that MUST be interpreted as meaning that the MPLS OAM
   Functions TLV is not present in the MPLS Echo Request.  If more than
   one MPLS OAM Functions TLV is present in the MPLS Echo request
   packet, then the first TLV SHOULD be processed and the rest ignored.
   Any parsing error within nested sub-TLVs that is not specified in
   Section 3 SHOULD be treated as described in [RFC4379].

2.2.1.  BFD Configuration Sub-TLV

   The BFD Configuration sub-TLV, depicted in Figure 3, is defined for
   BFD OAM-specific configuration parameters.  The "BFD Configuration
   sub-TLV" is carried as a sub-TLV of the "OAM Functions TLV".

   This TLV accommodates generic BFD OAM information and carries sub-
   TLVs.

                Figure 3: BFD Configuration Sub-TLV Format

   Sub-type: Indicates a new sub-type, the BFD Configuration sub-TLV
   (value 100).

   Length: Indicates the length of the Value field in octets.

   Version: Identifies the BFD protocol version.  If a node does not
   support a specific BFD version, an error must be generated: "OAM
   Problem/Unsupported BFD Version".

   BFD Negotiation (N): If set, timer negotiation/renegotiation via BFD
   Control Messages is enabled.  When cleared, it is disabled and timer
   configuration is achieved using the BFD Negotiation Timer Parameters
   sub-TLV as described in Section 2.2.3.

   Symmetric session (S): If set, the BFD session MUST use symmetric
   timing values.  If cleared, the BFD session MAY use any timing values
   either negotiated or explicitly configured.

   Integrity (I): If set, BFD Authentication MUST be enabled.  If the
   BFD Configuration sub-TLV does not include a BFD Authentication sub-
   TLV, the authentication MUST use Keyed SHA1 with an empty pre-shared
   key (all 0s).  If the egress LSR does not support BFD Authentication,
   an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/BFD Authentication
   unsupported".  If the Integrity flag is clear, then Authentication

   Encapsulation Capability (G): If set, it shows the capability of
   encapsulating BFD messages into the G-ACh channel.  If both the G bit
   and U bit are set, configuration gives precedence to the G bit.

   Encapsulation Capability (U): If set, it shows the capability of
   encapsulating BFD messages into IP/UDP packets.  If both the G bit
   and U bit are set, configuration gives precedence to the G bit.

   If the egress LSR does not support any of the ingress LSR
   Encapsulation Capabilities, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/
   Unsupported BFD Encapsulation format".

   Bidirectional (B): If set, it configures BFD in the Bidirectional
   mode.  If it is not set, it configures BFD in the unidirectional
   mode.  In the second case, the source node does not expect any
   Discriminator values back from the destination node.

   Reserved: Reserved for future specification; set to 0 on transmission
   and ignored when received.

   The BFD Configuration sub-TLV MUST include the following sub-TLVs in
   the MPLS Echo Request message:

   o  BFD Local Discriminator sub-TLV, if the B flag is set in the MPLS
      Echo Request;

   o  BFD Negotiation Timer Parameters sub-TLV, if the N flag is
      cleared.

   The BFD Configuration sub-TLV MUST include the following sub-TLVs in
   the MPLS Echo Reply message:

   o  BFD Local Discriminator sub-TLV;

   o  BFD Negotiation Timer Parameters sub-TLV if:

   Sub-type: Indicates a new sub-type, the BFD Negotiation Timer
   Parameters sub-TLV (value 102).

   Length: Indicates the length of the Value field in octets (12).
   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval: If the S (symmetric) flag
   is set in the BFD Configuration sub-TLV, defined in Section 2.2.1, it
   expresses the desired time interval (in microseconds) at which the
   ingress LER intends to both transmit and receive BFD periodic control
   packets.  If the receiving edge LSR cannot support such a value, it
   SHOULD reply with an interval greater than the one proposed.

   If the S (symmetric) flag is cleared in the BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV, this field expresses the desired time interval (in microseconds)
   at which an edge LSR intends to transmit BFD periodic control packets
   in its transmitting direction.

   Acceptable Min. Asynchronous RX interval: If the S (symmetric) flag
   is set in the BFD Configuration sub-TLV, Figure 3, this field MUST be
   equal to Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX interval and has no
   additional meaning respect to the one described for "Acceptable Min.
   Asynchronous TX interval".

   If the S (symmetric) flag is cleared in the BFD Configuration sub-
   TLV, it expresses the minimum time interval (in microseconds) at
   which edge LSRs can receive BFD periodic control packets.  If this
   value is greater than the value of Acceptable Min. Asynchronous TX
   interval received from the other edge LSR, such an edge LSR MUST
   adopt the interval expressed in this Acceptable Min. Asynchronous RX
   interval.

   Required Echo TX Interval: The minimum interval (in microseconds)
   between received BFD Echo packets that this system is capable of
   supporting, less any jitter applied by the sender as described in
   Section 6.8.9 of [RFC5880].  This value is also an indication for the
   receiving system of the minimum interval between transmitted BFD Echo
   packets.  If this value is zero, the transmitting system does not
   support the receipt of BFD Echo packets.  If the receiving system
   cannot support this value, the "Unsupported BFD TX Echo rate
   interval" error MUST be generated.  By default, the value is set to
   0.

   Sub-type: Indicates a new sub-type, the BFD Authentication sub-TLV
   (value 103).

   Length: Indicates the length of the Value field in octets (4).

   Auth Type: Indicates which type of authentication to use.  The same
   values as are defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC5880] are used.  Simple
   Password SHOULD NOT be used if other authentication types are
   available.

   Auth Key ID: Indicates which authentication key or password
   (depending on Auth Type) should be used.  How the key exchange is
   performed is out of scope of this document.  If the egress LSR does
   not support this Auth Key ID, an "OAM Problem/Mismatch of BFD
   Authentication Key ID" error MUST be generated.

   Reserved: Reserved for future specification; set to 0 on transmission
   and ignored when received.

   An implementation MAY change the mode of authentication if an
   operator re-evaluates the security situation in and around the
   administrative domain.  If the BFD Authentication sub-TLV is used for
   a BFD session in Up state, then the Sender of the MPLS LSP Echo
   Request SHOULD ensure that old and new modes of authentication, i.e.,
   a combination of Auth.Type and Auth.  Key ID, are used to send and
   receive BFD control packets, until the Sender can confirm that its
   peer has switched to the new authentication.

   Sub-type: Indicates a new sub-type, the "Traffic Class sub-TLV"
   (value 104).

   Length: Indicates the length of the Value field in octets (4).

   TC: Identifies the Traffic Class (TC) [RFC5462] for periodic
   continuity monitoring messages or packets with fault management
   information.

   If the TC sub-TLV is present, then the sender of any periodic
   continuity monitoring messages or packets with fault management
   information on the LSP, with a Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC)
   that corresponds to the FEC for which fault detection is being
   performed, MUST use the value contained in the TC field of the sub-
   TLV as the value of the TC field in the top label stack entry of the
   MPLS label stack.  If the TC sub-TLV is absent from either "BFD
   Configuration sub-TLV" or "Fault Management Signal sub-TLV", then
   selection of the TC value is a local decision.

2.2.6.  Performance Monitoring Sub-TLV

   If the MPLS OAM Functions TLV has any of the L (Loss), D (Delay), and
   T (Throughput) flags set, the Performance Monitoring sub-TLV MUST be
   present.  Failure to include the correct sub-TLVs MUST result in an
   "OAM Problem/PM Configuration Error" being generated.

   The Performance Monitoring sub-TLV provides the configuration
   information mentioned in Section 7 of [RFC6374].  It includes support
   for the configuration of quality thresholds and, as described in
   [RFC6374]:

      ...the crossing of which will trigger warnings or alarms, and
      result in reporting and exception notification will be integrated
      into the system-wide network management and reporting framework.

   In case the values need to be different than the default ones, the
   Performance Monitoring sub-TLV MAY include the following sub-TLVs:

   o  PM Loss sub-TLV, if the L flag is set in the MPLS OAM Functions
      TLV;

   o  PM Delay sub-TLV, if the D flag is set in the MPLS OAM Functions

   J:    Delay variation/jitter (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the egress
         LSR does not support Delay variation measurements and the J
         flag is set, an "OAM Problem/Delay variation unsupported" error
         MUST be generated.

   Y:    Dyadic (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the egress LSR does not
         support Dyadic mode and the Y flag is set, an "OAM Problem/
         Dyadic mode unsupported" error MUST be generated.

   K:    Loopback (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the egress LSR does not
         support Loopback mode and the K flag is set, an "OAM Problem/
         Loopback mode unsupported" error MUST be generated.

   C:    Combined (1=ACTIVE, 0=NOT ACTIVE).  If the egress LSR does not
         support Combined mode and the C flag is set, an "OAM Problem/
         Combined mode unsupported" error MUST be generated.

   Reserved:  Reserved for future specification; set to 0 on

         1-4 fields represent octet counts.  When set to 0, indicates
         that the Counter 1-4 fields represent packet counts.  By
         default, it is set to 0.

   Reserved: Reserved for future specification; set to 0 on transmission
   and ignored when received.

   Measurement Interval: The time interval (in milliseconds) at which
   Delay Measurement query messages MUST be sent on both directions.  If
   the edge LSR receiving the Path message cannot support such a value,
   it can reply with a higher interval.  By default, it is set to (1000)
   as per [RFC6375].

   Test Interval: Test messages interval (in milliseconds) as described
   in [RFC6374].  By default, it is set to (10) as per [RFC6375].

   Delay Threshold: The threshold value of measured two-way delay (in
   milliseconds) over which action(s) SHOULD be triggered.

2.2.9.  Fault Management Signal Sub-TLV

   The FMS sub-TLV depicted in Figure 12 is carried as a sub-TLV of the
   MPLS OAM Configuration sub-TLV.  When both working and protection
   paths are configured, both LSPs SHOULD be configured with identical
   settings of the E flag, T flag, and the refresh timer.  An
   implementation MAY configure the working and protection LSPs with
   different settings of these fields in case of 1:N protection.

             Figure 12: Fault Management Signal Sub-TLV Format

   Sub-type: Indicates a new sub-type, the FMS sub-TLV (value 300).

   Length: Indicates the length of the Value field in octets.

   FMS Flags are used to enable the FMS Flags at end point MEPs and the
   Server MEPs of the links over which the LSP is forwarded.  In this
   document, only the S flag pertains to Server MEPs.

   The following flags are defined:

   E:    Enable Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) and Lock Report (LKR)
         signaling as described in [RFC6427].  Default value is 1
         (enabled).  If the egress MEP does not support FMS Flag
         generation, an "OAM Problem/Fault management signaling
         unsupported" error MUST be generated.

   S:    Indicate to a Server MEP that it should transmit AIS and LKR
         signals on the client LSP.  Default value is 0 (disabled).  If
         a Server MEP that is capable of generating FMS messages is, for
         some reason, unable to do so for the LSP being signaled, an
         "OAM Problem/Unable to create fault management association"
         error MUST be generated.

   T:    Set timer value, enabled the configuration of a specific timer
         value.  Default value is 0 (disabled).

   Reserved: Bits 4-16 that follow the FMS Flags are reserved for future
   allocation.  These bits MUST be set to 0 on transmit and ignored on
   receipt if not allocated.

   Refresh Timer: Indicates the refresh timer of fault indication
   messages, in seconds.  The value MUST be between 1 to 20 seconds as
   specified for the Refresh Timer field in [RFC6427].  If the edge LSR
   receiving the Path message cannot support the value, it SHOULD reply
   with a higher timer value.

   FMS sub-TLV MAY include Traffic Class sub-TLV (Section 2.2.5).  If
   the TC sub-TLV is present, the value of the TC field MUST be used as
   the value of the TC field of an MPLS label stack entry for FMS
   messages.  If the TC sub-TLV is absent, then selection of the TC
   value is a local decision.

2.2.10.  Source MEP-ID Sub-TLV

   The Source MEP-ID sub-TLV depicted in Figure 13 is carried as a sub-
   TLV of the MPLS OAM Functions TLV.

3.  Summary of MPLS OAM Configuration Errors

   This is the summary of Return Codes [RFC4379] defined in this
   document:

   o  If an egress LSR does not support the specified BFD version, an
      error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD Version".

   o  If an egress LSR does not support the specified BFD Encapsulation
      format, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD
      Encapsulation format".

   o  If an egress LSR does not support BFD Authentication, and it is
      requested, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/BFD
      Authentication unsupported".

   o  If an egress LSR does not support the specified BFD Authentication
      Type, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported BFD
      Authentication Type".

   o  If an egress LSR is not able to use the specified Authentication
      Key ID, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Mismatch of BFD
      Authentication Key ID".

   o  If PM flags in MPLS OAM Functions TLV don't have corresponding PM
      sub-TLVs present, an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/PM
      Configuration Error".

   o  If an egress LSR does not support the specified Timestamp Format,
      an error MUST be generated: "OAM Problem/Unsupported Timestamp
      Format".

   o  If an egress LSR does not support specified Delay mode, an "OAM
      Problem/Unsupported Delay Mode" error MUST be generated.

   o  If an egress LSR does not support specified Loss mode, an "OAM
      Problem/Unsupported Loss Mode" error MUST be generated.

   o  If an egress LSR does not support Delay variation measurements,
      and it is requested, an "OAM Problem/Delay variation unsupported"
      error MUST be generated.

   o  If an egress LSR does not support Dyadic mode, and it is
      requested, an "OAM Problem/Dyadic mode unsupported" error MUST be
      generated.

RFC 7759           Extensions for MPLS-TP OAM Config.      February 2016


   o  If an egress LSR does not support Loopback mode, and it is
      requested, an "OAM Problem/Loopback mode unsupported" error MUST
      be generated.

   o  If an egress LSR does not support Combined mode, and it is
      requested, an "OAM Problem/Combined mode unsupported" error MUST
      be generated.

   o  If an egress LSR does not support Fault Monitoring Signals, and it
      is requested, an "OAM Problem/Fault management signaling
      unsupported" error MUST be generated.

   o  If an intermediate Server MEP supports Fault Monitoring Signals,
      but is unable to create an association, when requested to do so,
      an "OAM Problem/Unable to create fault management association"
      error MUST be generated.

   Ingress LSR MAY combine multiple MPLS OAM configuration TLVs and sub-
   TLVs into single MPLS echo request.  In case an egress LSR doesn't
   support any of the requested modes, it MUST set the return code to
   report the first unsupported mode in the list of TLVs and sub-TLVs.
   And if any of the requested OAM configuration is not supported, the
   egress LSR SHOULD NOT process OAM Configuration TLVs and sub-TLVs
   listed in the MPLS echo request.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  TLV and Sub-TLV Allocation

   IANA maintains the "Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label
   Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameters" registry and, within that
   registry, a subregistry for TLVs and sub-TLVs.

   IANA has allocated a new MPLS OAM Functions TLV from the Standards
   Action [RFC5226] range (0-16383) and sub-TLVs as follows from
   subregistry presented in Table 1, called "Sub-TLVs for TLV Type 27".

   Registration procedures for Sub-TLVs from ranges 0-16383 and
   32768-49161 are by Standards Action.  Ranges 16384-31743 and
   49162-64511 are through Specification Required (Experimental RFC
   Needed).

5.  Security Considerations

   The signaling of OAM-related parameters and the automatic
   establishment of OAM entities introduces additional security
   considerations to those discussed in [RFC4379].  In particular, a
   network element could be overloaded if an attacker were to request
   high-frequency liveliness monitoring of a large number of LSPs,
   targeting a single network element.  Implementations must be made
   cognizant of available OAM resources and MAY refuse new OAM
   configurations that would overload a node.  Additionally, policies to
   manage OAM resources may be used to provide some fairness in OAM
   resource distribution among monitored LSPs.

   Security of OAM protocols configured with extensions to LSP Ping
   described in this document are discussed in [RFC5880], [RFC5884],
   [RFC6374], [RFC6427], and [RFC6428].

   In order that the configuration of OAM functionality can be achieved
   securely through the techniques described in this document, security
   mechanisms must already be in place and operational for LSP Ping.
   Thus, the exchange of security parameters (such as keys) for use in
   securing OAM is outside the scope of this document and is assumed to
   use an off-line mechanism or an established secure key exchange
   protocol.

   Additional discussion of security for MPLS protocols can be found in
   [RFC5920].
