1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing
   relational database (RDBMS) implementations.

2.  The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework

   The SNMPv2 Network Management Framework consists of four major
   components.  They are:

      o RFC 1442 [1] which defines the SMI, the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

      o STD 17, RFC 1213 [2] defines MIB-II, the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols.

      o RFC 1445 [3] which defines the administrative and other
        architectural aspects of the framework.

      o RFC 1448 [4] which defines the protocol used for network
        access to managed objects.

      o RFC 1443 [5] which describes textual conventions for the
        framework.

   The framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.  In particular, the RDBMS-MIB can be
   seen as an extension of

      o RFC 1565 [6] which defines the MIB for monitoring network
        service applications.

2.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to refer to the
   object type.

3.  Overview

   The RDBMS-MIB contains objects that may be used to manage relational
   database implementations.  Specifically, it contains information on
   installed databases, servers, and on the relation of databases and
   servers.  The terms used in this database are described below.

3.1.  Terminology

   Vendors and Products
        are providers of database systems on a host.  These vendors
        may have more than one database product that is manageable
        through this MIB.  On a host, there may be systems from
        multiple vendors, multiple systems from a single vendor, or
        any other combination.  There may be a private MIB for each
        vendor, and this may be located using the PrivateMibOID
        objects in some of the tables.

   Databases
        are collections of interrelated data organized according to a
        schema to serve one or more applications. A database is, for
        purposes of this MIB, a collection of tables whose
        organization is based on the relational model. There may be
        one or more databases available in each system on the host
        from each product. In the MIB, data about databases is
        captured in the rdbmsDbTable and the rdbmsDbInfoTable, each
        with one row per database.

   Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
        A collection of integrated services which support database
        management and together support and control the creation, use
        and maintenance of relational databases. Servers as defined
        in this MIB provide the functions of the RDBMS.

   Servers
        are entities that provide access to databases.  For this MIB,
        servers are defined to be entities that may exist
        independently of other servers.  A server may or may not be a
        single process, based on its independence from other
        processes.  In this MIB, information about servers is
        captured in the rdbmsSvrTable, the rdbmsSvrInfoTable, each
        with one row per server extending the applTable from the
        APPLICATION-MIB of RFC 1565.  The rdbmsSvrTable and
        rdbmsSvrInfoTable are both indexed by the applIndex of that
        MIB.

   Associations
        Inbound associations are local or remote conversations,
        usually instances of the SQL CONNECT statement, as made
        visible in servers.  The MIB does not currently reveal
        individual associations; there are association counters in
        the dbmsSvrInfoTable and the applTable.

   There are also relationships between servers and databases.  All
   obvious relationships are possible and supported:

   o    1 database : 1 server

   o    1 database : many servers

   o    many databases : 1 server

   o    many databases : many servers

3.2.  Structure and Features

   The information in this MIB module is organized into nine tables,
   twelve potentially writable objects, and two traps, as follows.

3.2.1.  Tables

   o    databases installed on a host/system (rdbmsDbTable)

   o    actively opened databases (rdbmsDbInfoTable)

   o    database configuration parameters (rdbmsDbParamTable)

   o    database limited resources (rdbmsDbLimitedResourceTable)

   o    database servers installed on a system (rdbmsSrvTable)

   o    active database servers (rdbmsSrvInfoTable)

   o    configuration parameters for a server (rdbmsSrvParamTable)

   o    server limited resources (rdbmsSrvLimitedResourceTable)

   o    relation of servers and databases on a host (rdbmsRelTable)

   These entities have broad applicability among database systems, and
   are enough for many monitoring tasks.  They are far from adequate for
   detailed management or performance monitoring of specific database
   products.  This gap is expected to be filled with vendor and product
   specific MIBs addressing the entities that have not been codified
   here.

3.2.2.  Writable objects

   The MIB requires no writable objects for conformance.  There is no
   expectation that RDBMS systems may be actively managed through this
   MIB.  However, the RDBMS-MIB supports the capability to modify the
   following objects if the implementor so chooses.

   o    rdbmsDbContact

   o    rdbmsDbInfoSizeAllocated

   o    rdbmsDbParamCurrValue

   o    rdbmsDbParamComment rdbmsDbLimitedResourceLimit

   o    rdbmsDbLimitedResourceDescription

   o    rdbmsSrvContact

   o    rdbmsSrvInfoMaxInboundAssociations

   o    rdbmsSrvParamCurrValue

   o    rdbmsSrvParamComment

   o    rdbmsSrvLimitedResourceLimit

   o    rdbmsSrvLimitedResourceDescription

3.2.3.  Traps

   The RDBMS-MIB contains two traps:

   o    rdbmsStateChange

   o    rdbmsOutOfSpace

           applVersion - The version number of this server, in product
           specific format.

           applOperStatus - up(1) means operational and available for
           general use.  down(2) means the server is not available for
           use, but is known to the agent.  The other states have broad
           meaning, and may need to be supplemented by the vendor
           private MIB.  Halted(3) implies an administrative state of
           unavailability.  Congested(4) implies a resource or or
           administrative limit is prohibiting new inbound associations.
           The 'available soon' description of restarting(5) may include
           an indeterminate amount of recovery.

           applLastChange is the time the agent noticed the most recent
           change to applOperStatus.

           applInboundAssociation is the number of currently active
           local and remote conversations (usually SQL connects).

           applOutboundAssociations is not provided by this MIB.

           applAccumulatedInboundAssociations is the total number of
