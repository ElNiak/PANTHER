              Deprecating Secure Sockets Layer Version 3.0

Abstract

   The Secure Sockets Layer version 3.0 (SSLv3), as specified in RFC
   6101, is not sufficiently secure.  This document requires that SSLv3
   not be used.  The replacement versions, in particular, Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 (RFC 5246), are considerably more secure and
   capable protocols.

   This document updates the backward compatibility section of RFC 5246
   and its predecessors to prohibit fallback to SSLv3.

1.  Introduction

   Since it was released in 1996, the SSLv3 protocol [RFC6101] has been
   subject to a long series of attacks, both on its key exchange
   mechanism and on the encryption schemes it supports.  Despite being
   replaced by TLS 1.0 [RFC2246] in 1999, and subsequently TLS 1.1 in
   2002 [RFC4346] and 1.2 in 2006 [RFC5246], availability of these
   replacement versions has not been universal.  As a result, many
   implementations of TLS have permitted the negotiation of SSLv3.

   The predecessor of SSLv3, SSL version 2, is no longer considered
   sufficiently secure [RFC6176].  SSLv3 now follows.

RFC 7568                   SSLv3 Is Not Secure                 June 2015


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Do Not Use SSL Version 3.0

   SSLv3 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of SSLv3 from any version of TLS
   MUST NOT be permitted.

   Any version of TLS is more secure than SSLv3, though the highest
   version available is preferable.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,00}.  Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,00}.  Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,00} MUST respond with a "protocol_version" alert
   message and close the connection.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending ClientHello.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate SSLv3.

4.  SSLv3 Is Comprehensively Broken

4.1.  Record Layer

   The non-deterministic padding used in the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
   construction of SSLv3 trivially permits the recovery of plaintext
   [POODLE].  More generally, the CBC modes of SSLv3 use a flawed MAC-
   then-encrypt construction that has subsequently been replaced in TLS
   versions [RFC7366].  Unfortunately, the mechanism to correct this
   flaw relies on extensions: a feature added in TLS 1.0.  SSLv3 cannot
   be updated to correct this flaw in the same way.

   The flaws in the CBC modes in SSLv3 are mirrored by the weakness of
   the stream ciphers it defines.  Of those defined, only RC4 is
   currently in widespread use.  RC4, however, exhibits serious biases
   and is also no longer fit for use [RFC7465].

   This leaves SSLv3 with no suitable record protection mechanism.

4.2.  Key Exchange

   The SSLv3 key exchange is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
   when renegotiation [RFC5746] or session resumption [TRIPLE-HS] are
   used.  Each flaw has been fixed in TLS by means of extensions.
   Again, SSLv3 cannot be updated to correct these flaws.

4.3.  Custom Cryptographic Primitives

   SSLv3 defines custom constructions for Pseudorandom Function (PRF),
   Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC), and digital signature
   primitives.  Such constructions lack the deep cryptographic scrutiny
   that standard constructions used by TLS have received.  Furthermore,
   all SSLv3 primitives rely on SHA-1 [RFC3174] and MD5 [RFC1321]: these
   hash algorithms are considered weak and are being systematically
   replaced with stronger hash functions, such as SHA-256 [FIPS180-4].

5.  Limited Capabilities

   SSLv3 is unable to take advantage of the many features that have been
   added to recent TLS versions.  This includes the features that are
   enabled by ClientHello extensions, which SSLv3 does not support.

   Though SSLv3 can benefit from new cipher suites, it cannot benefit
   from new cryptographic modes and features.  Of these, the following
   are particularly prominent:

   o  Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) modes are
      added in [RFC5246].

   o  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Digital Signature
      Algorithm (ECDSA) are added in [RFC4492].

   o  Stateless session tickets [RFC5077].

   o  A datagram mode of operation, DTLS [RFC6347].

   o  Application-layer protocol negotiation [RFC7301].

6.  Security Considerations

   This entire document aims to improve security by prohibiting the use
   of a protocol that is not secure.
