       Allocation of a Generic Associated Channel Type for ITU-T
   MPLS Transport Profile Operation, Maintenance, and Administration
                             (MPLS-TP OAM)

Abstract

   This document assigns a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type for
   carrying ITU-T MPLS Transport Profile Operations, Administration, and
   Management (MPLS-TP OAM) messages in the MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel.

Status of This Memo

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes.

   This document is a product of the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF).  It represents the consensus of the IETF community.  It has
   received public review and has been approved for publication by the
   Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).  Not all documents
   approved by the IESG are a candidate for any level of Internet
   Standard; see Section 2 of RFC 5741.

IESG Note

   The IESG notes that the IETF has developed a set of OAM tools for
   MPLS-TP that have been published as Standards Track RFCs.  A list of
   the relevant RFCs can be found in RFC 6669.  The approval of this
   document and the assignment of an ACh Type does not constitute
   endorsement by the IETF of the alternate MPLS-TP OAM documented in
   G.8113.1.  The IESG recommends instead that the RFCs noted above
   should be implemented.

1.  Introduction

   The Transport Profile of MPLS (MPLS-TP) defined in [RFC5654] is a
   profile of MPLS technology for use in packet transport networks.  The
   MPLS-TP profile includes a set of Operations, Administration, and
   Management (OAM) tools defined by the IETF [RFC6669] that are used to
   meet the OAM functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].

   ITU-T Recommendation [G.8113.1] documents MPLS-TP OAM.  This
   Recommendation builds upon Ethernet OAM as documented in [Y.1731].
   The messages in [G.8113.1] are defined to be carried in a new Generic
   Associated Channel (G-ACh) Type in the MPLS Generic Associated
   Channel.  In order to carry these messages in an interoperable
   fashion, a Generic Associated Channel Type from the IANA maintained
   registry "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" is to be used.

   To fulfill the request from ITU-T SG15 in [LS370] and to allow
   deployment of the [G.8113.1] OAM solution without using an
   experimental G-ACh Type, IANA has assigned a G-ACh Type <0x8902> for
   use by the ITU-T for [G.8113.1].  This G-ACh Type is known as the
   "G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type".

   A number of experts in the IETF do not consider that the development
   or deployment of a second protocol solution within the same
   architectural problem space is necessary or advisable [RFC6670].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Scope of the G.8113.1 OAM G-ACh Type

   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST only be used for OAM
   messages, as defined in the ITU-T Recommendation [G.8113.1], carried
   in the G-ACh.  The OAM messages and procedures carried behind this
   G-ACh Type are restricted to only those that address the OAM
   functional requirements defined in [RFC5860].  Other message types
   MUST NOT be carried behind this G-ACh Type.

   All ITU-T Recommendations are subject to updates by errata,
   corrigenda, amendments, or complete revisions.  In any update of
   [G.8113.1], the G-ACh Type assigned by this document MUST NOT be used
   for any functions not identified as OAM functional requirements in
   [RFC5860].  An update of [G.8113.1] may use the G-ACh Type assigned
   by this document to support the OAM functions identified in
   [RFC5860].  When an amendment or complete revision of G.8113.1 is
   approved, the reference to [G.8113.1], provided in this document,
   should be updated to show the approval date of the new version.

   The G-ACh Type assigned by this document may be used on any transport
   construct that uses the G-ACh, e.g., MPLS-TP Sections, MPLS-TP LSPs,
   or PWs as described in [G.8113.1].

4.  Security Considerations

   As noted in [RFC5586], when new G-ACh Types are defined, the
   "security considerations MUST be described in the relevant associated
   channel type specification".  The IETF takes this opportunity to
   remind the ITU-T of the need to describe security considerations in
   [G.8113.1].

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Pseudowire Associated Channel Types" sub-registry
   of the "Pseudowire Name Spaces (PWE3)" registry.

   IANA has allocated a new G-ACh Type as follows:

      Value        Description              TLV Follows  Reference
      -----------  -----------------------  -----------  ---------
      0x8902       G.8113.1 OAM             No           [RFC6671]
