Abstract

   This document describes the standardization collaboration between the
   Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF).

1.  Introduction

   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serves
   as the basis for establishing a cooperation framework between the
   Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and the Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF).  This cooperation is intended to secure timely development of
   technical specifications that facilitate maximum interoperability
   with existing (fixed and mobile) Internet systems, devices, and
   protocols.

   Within the OMA, specific activities are undertaken through OMA
   working groups, each with an area of responsibility.  These
   activities are authorized, and their output is approved by, the OMA
   Technical Plenary.  The list of OMA working groups, OMA
   Specifications for public comment, the OMA work program, and publicly
   available working group drafts can be found at the OMA web site,
   <http://www.openmobilealliance.org>.

   Within the IETF, activities are undertaken within a framework of
   Areas, with specific activities being undertaken by working groups
   that are chartered within each Area.  Working group output is
   reviewed by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) and
   published by the RFC-Editor.  IETF activities are based on a

   principle of open contribution and participation by any interested
   party.  Information on IETF working groups, current work item drafts,
   meeting schedules, and mailing lists are published on the IETF web
   site, <http://www.ietf.org>.

   The IETF and the OMA, are cooperating with a mutual desire to support
   the integrity of specifications and standards developed by each body.
   The preferred approach is that the OMA uses the Internet standards
   unchanged, if feasible, and communicates requirements for change to
   the IETF, as needed.  The parties intend to work together in an
   effort to avoid duplication of work.

   Each organization will operate according to its own rules and
   procedures, including rules governing Intellectual Property Rights
   (IPR), specification elaboration, approval, and maintenance.

   This cooperation framework is intended to guide collaborative
   efforts, and should be put into use in as much as it is applicable to
   these efforts.  If either party finds this framework inapplicable,
   then it may notify the other party so that this framework may be
   modified or withdrawn, as appropriate.

2.  Basis of Collaboration

   In the further development of OMA specifications, the benefit of
   adopting Internet specifications has been identified.

   Although this document recognizes the importance of interoperability
   of OMA specifications with the existing Internet and hence the use of
   IETF standards, the OMA recognizes that additions or modifications
   might be needed in order to make the IETF Internet specifications
   meet the needs of the OMA.  In such cases, the OMA will take its
   concerns directly to the appropriate IETF working groups for
   resolution.  When no appropriate working group can be found or it is
   not known where to direct the communication, or in the case of
   resolution of consequent matters, the issue will be raised through
   the OMA's designated liaison to the IETF.

   The IETF may also need to ask questions of the OMA in order to refine
   its understanding of OMA requirements or may wish to offer guidance
   to OMA on the effective use of Internet specifications.  Where
   possible, these communications will occur in the context of a
   discussion between OMA and an IETF working group.  In the event that
   a working group level discussion is deemed inappropriate for the
   desired communication, the matter will be raised through the IETF's
   designated liaison to the OMA.

3.  Document Sharing

   Both the OMA and the IETF encourage the sharing of draft documents
   that are of mutual interest.

   All IETF documents are publicly available from the IETF web site, and
   discussion of documents is hosted on open mailing lists.

   OMA documents intended for public consumption, including working
   drafts, are published for open access on the OMA web site,
   <http://www.openmobilealliance.org/>.  Technical contributions to OMA
   by its members are also encouraged to make publicly available.

   The OMA and the IETF will work to update and exchange, on a regular
   basis, a list of dependencies between each organization's
   specifications and work in progress.

4.  Participation in the IETF Process

   Participation in the IETF process is completely open.  This allows
   OMA delegates to participate to whatever extent the OMA considers
   appropriate in IETF meetings and mailing list discussions to assist
   the IETF in refining its understanding of OMA requirements and in
   meeting requirements that the IETF deems appropriate.  This close
   working relationship also offers an excellent opportunity for OMA
   delegates to receive informal guidance from IETF on OMA's use of
   Internet specifications.

   The vast majority of technical discussions and decision making within
   the IETF is undertaken by using open mailing lists.  It is
   recommended that interested individuals subscribe to and participate
   on these lists.

   The OMA is to be notified of new work to be undertaken by the IETF
   via a nominated IETF liaison notification mechanism.

5.  Designated Liaisons

   When the informal working group level of interaction is insufficient,
   matters can be raised through a liaison channel.  The OMA and the
   IETF shall each establish liaison functions for communication with
   the other organization and shall appoint one or more individuals to
   those functions.

5.1.  IETF Liaison to OMA

   The preferred way for organizations to work with IETF is through the
   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number of individual
   liaison roles with other organizations when conditions warrant the
   appointment of a specific person.

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) shall appoint a specific person
   to serve as the OMA Liaison.  The role of the IETF's OMA Liaison is
   to act as an initial contact point in IETF for administrative aspects
   of this collaboration that cannot easily be handled in other ways
   (e.g., at a technical level by interactions with IETF Working Groups
   or Area Directors).  It is agreed that the role does not carry the
   expectation of attendance at OMA meetings or participation in OMA
   administrative processes, and it is anticipated that all liaison
   efforts assigned to this individual will be carried out by electronic
   mail.  It is understood that the liaison does not have the ability to
   make exceptions to, or special provisions for, IETF policies and
   procedures.

   It is expected that the individual appointed to this role would:

   o  be informed by the OMA of OMA activities on behalf of the IETF,
      including new work proposals, and be able to report those using
      appropriate channels within the IETF,

   o  convey liaisons statements from the OMA to the IETF, and be
      responsible for shepherding the OMA communication to the relevant
      parts of the IETF,

   o  report to the OMA on progress with IETF consideration of OMA
      liaison statements, and

   o  have direct access to the OMA technical leadership as well as
      direct access to the IAB and IETF Area Directors, as required.

   OMA meetings are normally only open to delegates from OMA member
   organizations.  To assist the information flow between the
   organizations, the IETF may, by prior written invitation from the OMA
   on a per-case basis, send a representative to participate in and
   represent the IETF at an OMA Technical Plenary and working group
   meeting under conditions set forth by the OMA.  The representative
   could be the IETF liaison or, in the event that the liaison cannot
   attend, some other designated individual.

5.2.  OMA Liaison to IETF

   The OMA Technical Plenary shall establish an IETF liaison to be the
   initial contact point in the OMA for matters pertaining to the OMA-
   IETF cooperation.  The OMA-IETF liaison function, therefore, is
   expected to work with the concerned IETF and OMA working groups and
   to support the interaction between the OMA and the IETF.

6.  Formal Liaison Statements

   Whenever possible, and as the preferred primary method of
   communication and coordination of activity, communication at the
   working group level is strongly encouraged.

   When deemed necessary, formal communication between OMA and IETF is
   also permitted.  These communications are to be recorded in the form
   of Liaison Statements, and the IETF will use the OMA liaison role to
   convey these statements between the IETF and the OMA.  All liaison
   statements made by the IETF or directed to the IETF shall be
   published by the IETF as public documents.  All liaison statements
   made by the IETF will comply with the IETF IPR policy as documented
   in RFC 3667 [1] and RFC 3668 [2].

7.  Contributions

   OMA members may make contributions to the IETF in their capacity as
   IETF participants, under the IETF's IPR policy, as documented in RFC
   3667 [1] and RFC3668 [2].

   IETF participants who are also members of the OMA may make
   contributions to the OMA only in their capacity as OMA members, under
   the OMA's membership rules, including its IPR policy.

   OMA mailing lists are not open to the general public.  It is
   recommended that work of mutual interest be discussed on the relevant
   IETF mailing lists.

   The OMA may make normative references to the IETF Proposed Standard,
   Draft Standard, Standard, Best Common Practice and Informational
   specifications that are published as part of the "Request for
   Comments" (RFC) document series.

8.  Co-development of Documents

   The IETF and the OMA will not co-develop any documents or material.

   that are included in any reproduction of published material made
   available to it under this cooperation framework.

9.2.  General

   a. Neither the OMA or the IETF acquires any intellectual or
      industrial property rights under this cooperation framework or
      through any disclosure.  No license to any patent, trademark,
      copyright, or other proprietary right is granted here.

   b. There is no obligation for either the OMA or the IETF to
      incorporate the materials presented by the other party.

   c. This cooperation framework and the relationship between the IETF
      and the OMA does not constitute a partnership, joint venture,
      agency, or contract of employment between the IETF and the OMA.
