# We define structures for temporal proof goals.
#
# A temporal proof goal is of the form `M |= phi` where
# `M` is a progam term and phi is a temporal formula.
#
# A normal program is of the form:
#
#     let
#         name1 = action1
#         ...
#         namen = procn
#     in
#         init;
#         while *
#         invariant inv1;
#         ...
#         invariant invm;
#         {
#             diverge;
#             assume asm1;
#             ...
#             assume asmp;
#             if * { call1 }
#             else if * {call2}
#             ...
#             else {callk}
#         }
#
#
# where
#
# - `namei` is an action name,
# - `actioni` is an action term,
# - `init` is an initial progam statement
# - `calli` is a call term
# - `diverge` is a statment that skips or diverges
# - `invi` is a non-temporal formula
# -  `asmi` is a non-temporal formula.
#
# An action term is of the form:
#
#     action (inputs) returns (outputs)
#
# where inputs and outputs are lists of symbols.
#
# A call term is of the form:
#
#     {
#         var inp1 : inptype1;
#         ...
#         var inpn : inptype1;
#
#         var out1 : outtype1;
#         ...
#         var outm : outtypem;
#
#         call (out1,...outm) := name (inp1,...,inpn)
#     }
#
# That is, it calls the action bound to name `name` with
# non-deterministic arguments;
#
# The `diverge` statement models the fact the the environement
# may cease to call program actions at any time.
#
#
# We say `M` is failure-free if it has no execution leading to failure
# of an assertion (equivalently if `wlp(M,true)` is valid).
#
# We say `M |= phi` is true if `M` is failure-free and it every
# infinite trace of `M` satisfies phi. If `phi=true` this is
# equivalent to validity `wlp(M,true)`. In this case we say the goal
# is "reduced". A liveness-to-safety transformation is a tactic that
# reduces `phi` to `true`.
# 
# To more easily manipluate normal programs, we introduce a special
# syntax node for them. We introduce the following classes for this purpose:
#
# - ActionTerm is an action term
# - ActionTermBinding is a name/action term pair
# - NormalProgram is consists of:
#       - a list of ActionTermBindings `namei = actioni`
#       - an initial statement `init`
#       - a list of named loop invariants `invi`
#       - a list of named loop assumptions `asmi`
#       - as list of action names of the call terms
#
# Modular temporal semantics
# --------------------------
#
# Each temporal operator has an 'environment', which roughly
# corresponds to an isolate (to be more precise, the actions of an
# isolate and all of the actions of the isolates it depends
# on). Environments overlap, so at any moment the program is
# executing in some set of environments. To a temporal operator,
# program execution within its environment appears to be
# instantaneous or to diverge. In other words from the operator's
# point of view there are no intermediate states inside the code
# of its environment, so actions in the environment appear atomic.
#
# In the current implementation, the set of environments in which a
# given action executes is determined statically, and is provided by a
# list of environment labels attached to the action. This makes it
# relatively easy to determine at which program execution points the
# tableau automaton for a given operator must be synchronized. That
# is, steps of the tableau automaton never occur within the operator's
# environment. Outside of the environment, they occur either when some
# symbol that the formula depends on is mutated (i.e., when a non-stutter
# step occurs) or upon exit from the operator's environment (i.e., after a
# call statement into the environment from the outside.

    # 1) The operator's semantic constraint is an assumed invariant (i.e.,
    # it holds outside of any action)
    #
    # 2) An 'event' for the temporal operator occurs when (a) we return

    # occurring in it's body is mutated.
