# TLS Records
# ===========
#
# This document describes the structure of records transferred the TLS version 1.3. Currently,
# this is not a fully general description. In particular, it does not allow for TLS messages that
# span multiple TLS records.
#
# The information in this document is derived from [RFC 4256](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246)
# 

object tls = {

    # ### Protocol version

    # Protocol verion is two bytes, encoded as follows:
    #
    # | hi byte | lo byte | TLS version |
    # |---------|---------|-------------|
    # | 3       | 3       | 1.3         |

    type protocol_version
    interpret protocol_version -> bv[16]

    # ### Content types
    # 
    # This section details the various content types that may appear
    # in serialized form in a TLS record.
   
    # #### Handshake
    #
    # The handshake protocol uses messages of type `handshake`. 
    #
    
    type handshake

    # A handshake message has the following variants:
    #
    # | variant              | description  | tag |
    # |----------------------|--------------|-----|
    # | client_hello         | Client Hello | 1   |
    # | server_hello         | Client Hello | 2   |
    # | new_session_ticket   | Client Hello | 4   |
    # | encrypted_extensions | Client Hello | 8   |
    #
    # The serialized form of `handshake` has the following four-byte prefix:
    #
    # | byte 0 | bytes 1..3 |
    # |--------|------------|
    # | tag    | length     | 
    #
    # where "length" is the length of the subsequent message in bytes.
    #

    # ##### Extensions
    #
    # A sequence of extension fields may be appended to a handshake message.
    # An extension has the following fields:
    #
    # - `etype` The extension type, encoded in two bytes
    # - `content` The extension content as a byte stream. In serialized form,
    #   this is prefixed by a two-byte length field.
