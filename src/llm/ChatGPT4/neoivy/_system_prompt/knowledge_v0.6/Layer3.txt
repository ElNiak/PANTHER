# Layer 3: Security layer protocols

## TLS1.3
`TLS1.3` is the latest version of the `TLS` protocol. It is a security protocol that provides privacy and data integrity between two communicating applications. It's the most widely deployed security protocol used today, and is used for web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network. `TLS1.3` is the successor to `TLS1.2` and provides a number of security and performance improvements.
Simple interface using picotls, but not very flexible. No way to extend it. Allow to send encrypt packets through Ivy models.
Not a formal specification project but can be used in Ivy models.
