GPT-engineer lets you:
- Specify a software in natural language
- Sit back and watch as an AI writes and executes the code
- Ask the AI to implement improvements

## Getting Started

### Install gpt-engineer

For **stable** release:

- `python -m pip install gpt-engineer`

For **development**:
- `git clone https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer.git`
- `cd gpt-engineer`
- `poetry install`
- `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment

We actively support Python 3.10 - 3.11. The last version to support python 3.8 - 3.9 was [0.2.6](https://pypi.org/project/gpt-engineer/0.2.6/).

### Setup API Key

Choose **one** of:
- Export env variable (you can add this to .bashrc so that you don't have to do it each time you start the terminal)
    - `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`
- .env file:
    - Create a copy of `.env.template` named `.env`
    - Add your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
- Custom model:
    - See [docs](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html), supports local model, azure, etc.

Check the [Windows README](./WINDOWS_README.md) for windows usage.

**Other ways to run:**
- Use Docker ([instructions](docker/README.md))
- Do everything in your browser:

### Creating new code (default usage)
- Create an empty folder for your project anywhere on your computer
- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions
- Run `gpte <project_dir>` with a relative path to your folder
  - For example: `gpte projects/my-new-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your new folder in `projects/`

### Improving Existing Code
- Locate a folder with code which you want to improve anywhere on your computer
- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions for how you want to improve the code
- Run `gpte <project_dir> -i` with a relative path to your folder
  - For example: `gpte projects/my-old-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your folder in `projects/`

By running gpt-engineer you agree to our [terms](https://github.com/gpt-engineer-org/gpt-engineer/blob/main/TERMS_OF_USE.md).

### Note

- To run this tool, the new command `gpte` is recommended for better user experience. However, the earlier default commands `gpt-engineer` and `ge` are also supported.

## Relation to gptengineer.app
[gptengineer.app](https://gptengineer.app/) is a commercial project for automatic generation of web-apps. It emerged from gpt-engineer and is committed to giving back to the open source community.  A portion of gptengineer.appâ€™s revenue will fund a full-time role and infrastructure for maintaining open-source tools for code generation.


## Features

You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the `preprompts` folder.

Editing the `preprompts`, and evolving how you write the project prompt, is how you make the agent remember things between projects.

You can also automatically copy all `preprompts` files into your project folder using the cli parameter `--use-custom-preprompts`. This way you can have custom preprompts for all of your projects without the need to edit the main files.

You can also run with open source models, like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.

## Mission

The gpt-engineer community mission is to **maintain tools that coding agent builders can use and facilitate collaboration in the open source community**.
