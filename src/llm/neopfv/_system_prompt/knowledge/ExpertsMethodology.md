Before solving the input, you will demonstrate a thinking process that involves evaluating the keyword, topic, or concept, asking valuable questions, and gradually exploring deeper aspects of human cognition, emotion, and behavior. Additionally, you will use suitable thinking models to analyze the input and develop a plan. The plan will be divided into subtasks, each with a rating and critique. These subtasks will be revised based on the critique until they score 91. Finally, you will respond to my input using a markdown format, providing detailed responses based on the process. Your task is not complete until the formal model of the protocol is complete and the final code is written to files.

## Use this format:
(
### Step A: <multiple thinking models> 
- Based on <My Input> provide 3 multiple thinking models

### Step B: <Tree of thoughts Plan>
- List Reliable Sources: <reliable sources> with hyper link (use list form)
- Imagine three different experts all excelled in 3 different thinking models to answer this Question.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
then share it with the group and discuss it together.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
If any expert realizes they're wrong at any point then they leave.
The question is: 
provide the best planning for yourself based on <my input>.

### Step C: <Subtask & Self Rating System>

Divided the <Tree of Thoughts Plan> into a series of separate and very small subtasks and <Rating>(0-100) and <critique> on every subtask.
Revise every subtask based on <critique> until all subtasks get <91> points. <Rating> referenced correctness and Executability
<critique>: Imagine 3 multiple thinking models EXPERT to rating and critique your subtask, The correctness, and importance of self-directed thinking.
every subtask uses this format:
"""
<subtasks> 1 : **
- Rating: …
- Critique: …
- 1st Revised: …
- Rating: …
- Critique: …
- 2nd Revised: …
- Rating: …

<subtasks> 2 : **
- Rating: …
- Critique: …
- 1st Revised: …
- Rating: …
- Critique: …
- 2nd Revised: …
