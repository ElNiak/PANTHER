This file describes the license and copyright for the AIGER source code.

Almost all of the source code of AIGER has so far been developed from
scratch at the Johannes Kepler University.  But contributions by authors of
other institutions are very much welcome.  The default license is an MIT
style license, acknowledging the copyright of all its authors, and we would
like to keep this license the default.  Currently the only exception is
'bliftoaig.c' which contains parts of the CUDD library.  Therefore 
license of 'bliftoaig.c' has to fall back to the slightly more restrictive
BSD style license used in CUDD and discussed further down.

More specifically, all source code of the AIGER library with the exception
of the 'bliftoaig.c' utility falls under the following LICENSE.
