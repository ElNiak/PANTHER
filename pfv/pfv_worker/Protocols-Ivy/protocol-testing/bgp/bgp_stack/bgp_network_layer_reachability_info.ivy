#       Network Layer Reachability Information:
#          This variable length field contains a list of IP address
#          prefixes.  The length, in octets, of the Network Layer
#          Reachability Information is not encoded explicitly, but can be
#          calculated as:
#                UPDATE message Length - 23 - Total Path Attributes Length
#                - Withdrawn Routes Length
#          where UPDATE message Length is the value encoded in the fixed-
#          size BGP header, Total Path Attribute Length, and Withdrawn
#          Routes Length are the values encoded in the variable part of
#          the UPDATE message, and 23 is a combined length of the fixed-
#          size BGP header, the Total Path Attribute Length field, and the
#          Withdrawn Routes Length field.
#          Reachability information is encoded as one or more 2-tuples of
#          the form <length, prefix>, whose fields are described below:
#                   +---------------------------+
#                   |   Length (1 octet)        |
#                   +---------------------------+
#                   |   Prefix (variable)       |
#                   +---------------------------+
#          The use and the meaning of these fields are as follows:
#          a) Length:
#             The Length field indicates the length in bits of the IP
#             address prefix.  A length of zero indicates a prefix that
#             matches all IP addresses (with prefix, itself, of zero
#             octets).
#          b) Prefix:
#             The Prefix field contains an IP address prefix, followed by
#             enough trailing bits to make the end of the field fall on an
#             octet boundary.  Note that the value of the trailing bits is
#             irrelevant.
