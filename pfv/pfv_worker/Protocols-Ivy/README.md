IVy is a research tool intended to allow interactive development of
protocols and their proofs of correctness and to provide a platform
for developing and experimenting with automated proof techniques. In
particular, IVy provides interactive visualization of automated
proofs, and supports a use model in which the human protocol designer
and the automated tool interact to expose errors and prove
correctness.

# Installation
## Linux
On Debian-based Linux ditributions such as Ubuntu, download and install the file `ms-ivy_X.X_YYYY.deb` where `X.X` is the IVy version and `YYYY` is the machine architecture. Use your systemâ€™s package manager to install this package, or the following commands:
```
$ sudo dpkg -i ms-ivy_X.X_YYYY.deb
$ sudo apt-get install -f
```
The first command will report missing dependencies, which will be installed by the second command.

## Windows
The Windows binary distribution is in the form of a zip archive. Download the file `ivy.X.Y-.Windows-z86.zip`, where `X.X` is the IVy version (this will work on both 32-bit and 64 bit Intel Windows). Use Windows Explorer to extract this archive in the directory `C:\`. This should give you a directory `C:\ivy`. To use IVy in a command window, first execute this command:
```
> C:\ivy\scripts\activate
```
