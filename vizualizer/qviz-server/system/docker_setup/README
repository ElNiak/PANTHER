# Docker setup for qvis-server

We first build the Wireshark image, which is not intended to be executed on its own
We then use that as the basis for the qvis image, which installs all nodeJS based utilities + the webserver and makes sure stuff is up-to-date

The webserver is setup to pull and compile on each startup of the docker container for easy development.
For real, stable deployment, this should be changed (see the various startup.sh files). 

Basically, using the current setup, you can just change docker_setup/startup/startup.sh and commit it to this repository.
When the container restarts, it will execute the new commands in that file, without having to rebuild a new docker image.
